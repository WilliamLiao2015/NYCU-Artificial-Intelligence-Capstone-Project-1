Two Rivers Police Department\nIn a statement read at the hearing, Jodi Baur asked that the court reject her daughter’s request to lower her $15,000 bond.\n“I have known Katrina Baur longer than anyone else as I am her mother,” said the statement, read aloud by District Attorney Jacalyn LaBre.\n“Katrina has struggled with depression and anxiety for many years, has a history of erratic behavior. She has been suffering from traumatic brain injury and is highly likely to forget mandatory appearances.” \n“I don’t feel it’s worth the risk to lower her bond, especially as a victim has not been found and many questions have not been answered. She does need to be held accountable for what rules out in the future and I feel releasing her she would be a flight risk.”\nJodi Baur also revealed that her daughter cut ties with her family in October 2022 following years of volatile behavior.\nKatrina Baur’s mother claimed she had a history of abuse and “erratic behavior.” Two Rivers Police Department\nJodi Baur claims she was a victim of Katrina Baur, who allegedly unleashed “verbal and emotional abuse” for years before their relationship dissolved.\nThe mistreatment was severe enough for Jodi Baur to ask that the court issue a no-contact order to Katrina Baur should she be released on bail.\nThe judge in the case, however, declined Katrina Baur’s plea to have her bond decreased — stating that the $15,000 cash amount was set “right where it needs to be.”\nKatrina Baur was arrested on Feb. 21, the day after Vang, 39, reported Elijah missing.\nJesse Vang was teaching the boy “how to be a man,” Katrina Baur allegedly told police. Two Rivers Police Department\nHe told police he had been taking a nap in the morning with Elijah in the bedroom, but awoke three hours later to find the boy gone.\nElijah had been staying at Vang’s Two Rivers home since Katrina Baur dropped him off on Feb. 12 so Vang could teach the boy “to be a man,” the mother told police, according to a criminal complaint.\nKatrina Baur — who was planning on picking up Elijah on Feb. 23 — was about 30 miles away when he vanished.\nShe was initially charged with child neglect, which has since been amended to chronic child neglect. \nKatrina Baur dropped Elijah at her boyfriend’s house a week earlier for “disciplinary reasons,” according to court documents. independent.co.uk\nShe also faces two misdemeanor counts of resisting or obstructing an officer.\nVang was charged with one felony count of party-to-a-crime child neglect and is being held on a $20,000 cash bond.\nInvestigators are still on the hunt for little Elijah, who is 3 feet tall, has dark blond hair and brown eyes, and weighs about 45 pounds.\nLocal police and the FBI are offering a combined total of $25,000 in rewards for information about the missing boy. Ross Auto Service\nA Manitowoc County Crime Stoppers reward for information leading to the location and return of Elijah or the arrest and conviction of those responsible for his disappearance has risen to as much as $10,000, Two Rivers Police Chief Ben Meinnert said in a news release.\nThe Crime Stoppers reward is in addition to an FBI reward of up to $15,000 in the case.","length":3921,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T02:08:48Z","rating":[2,3,3,2,4,3,3],"reason":"The article receives a low score in Accuracy (2) as it lacks specific details about the case and fails to provide substantial evidence for the claims made.

She said that with agility and a proactive approach, internal auditors could effectively address emerging risks, such as those associated with new technologies and evolving regulatory requirements. “Internal auditors must shift from solely relying on periodic audits to continuous auditing and monitoring. “By embracing a dynamic and proactive approach, internal audit functions can stay ahead of the curve and effectively mitigate risks,“ she said in her speech while officiating the inaugural Bank Audit Conference 2024 (BAC 2024), organised by the Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers (AICB) and AICB’s Chief Internal Auditors Networking Group (CIANG). On technology, Wan Suraya said artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and data analytics will revolutionise the way audits are conducted, and internal audit teams should leverage these tools to enhance efficiency, gain deeper insights, and perform more precise and targeted audits. “Automation will streamline processes, enhance accuracy, and provide deeper insights into risks and opportunities. By harnessing the power of technology, internal auditors will be able to identify emerging risks in real-time and proactively mitigate them,“ she said. Echoing Wan Suraya’s views, Asian Institute of Chartered Bankers (AICB) chairman Tan Sri Azman Hashim said that AI and data analytics could enable internal auditors to dive deeper into larger reams of data to understand what’s sustainably driving the business. He further emphasised that as internal auditors adopt new technologies, the ethical implications of AI and the integrity of their data sources also demand equal attention. He also highlighted that continuous learning is key for internal auditors to advance into the future and secure relevance in the profession. Azman added that AICB remains committed and continues to focus its efforts on upholding the highest standards of professional conduct and competence for the Malaysian banking workforce through its membership, qualifications, and continuous professional development programmes. Internal audit is the third line of defence Emphasising the crucial role of the internal audit function in organisations, HSBC independent non-executive director Datin Seri Sunita Mei-Lin Rajakumar said that non-executive directors, who are often the majority of board members, according to the best practices of corporate governance, require an unvarnished, independent view of the business. “Internal audit is the third line of defence that provides an independent view of a business’s internal controls and risks. As businesses become more complex, internal audits ensure that a company is well-maintained and on track,” she said during the press conference at BAC 2024. Meanwhile, CIANG chairman Shamsul Bahrom said that BAC 2024 discussed critical issues impacting internal auditors and promoted greater knowledge sharing and best practices. He said that one of the key takeaways from the discussion of the audit committee’s expectations is that internal auditors should maintain the highest level of independence, professionalism, objectivity, and thoroughness in executing their mandate, emphasising on the audit report. “As an internal auditor myself, I wish to emphasise the importance of acknowledging that the internal audit functions as the third line of defence and must always remain relevant and effective to protect stakeholders’ interests. It cannot be overemphasised that the internal audit function needs to evolve with the operating landscape. “The efforts by AICB and CIANG in preparing for the future will promote stronger compliance within our institutions, meet the highest international standards, and contribute to the stability of the financial system and the broader economy,” he said in his speech at the closing ceremony of BAC 2024. Additionally, Shamsul said that they (CIANG) had heard fruitful deliberations, moderations, and invaluable input from its esteemed speakers and panellists discussing the expectations of the internal audit function. “The chief executive officer (CEO)’s viewpoint underlines the critical role of internal audits as stewards of governance and risk management in promoting organisational resilience, creativity, and strategy alignment. “Their perspective acts as a guiding beacon, emphasising the necessity for agility, flexibility and foresight in internal auditors and, most importantly, for them to be knowledgeable and well-versed in understanding what they are auditing,” he added. Themed “Future of Internal Audit - Embracing Change, Staying Relevant”, BAC 2024 was organised by AICB and CIANG to provide a platform for internal audit professionals and experts to discuss the megatrends shaping the new audit and risk management landscape, regulatory developments, and how to elevate further the standards of internal audit practices in financial institutions in Malaysia. The two-day conference ending today featured over 30 bankers, regulators, and internal audit experts shedding light on the notable global trends in the industry, including digital disruption and cybersecurity, the increasing importance of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in business coordination, and sustainability reporting. The conference drew over 500 delegates from local and international financial institutions and featured a pre-conference workshop that focused on integrating data security and cybersecurity into the internal audit framework. - Bernama","length":5758,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,8,7,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information on the importance of internal auditors adopting an agile, technology-driven approach.

But he issued two walks on eight consecutive pitches outside the strike zone and was clearly struggling to gain his footing on the mound as moisture continued to fall.\n“Whenever it gets like that, you’re going to be careful,” manager Bob Melvin said.\nThe first precipitation all spring also postponed the A’s exhibition earlier in the day, but the worst was thought to have passed by the time Harrison fired the first pitch against the Dodgers at 7:05 p.m. local time. However, rain continued to fall throughout, and the field was determined unplayable by the middle of the third inning.\t\t\t\t\nDespite the rainout, Harrison was able to get in the majority of the work he was scheduled for, throwing about 50 pitches of the 60 he planned to throw. The pitchers slated to follow him — Landen Roupp, Camilo Doval, Trevor McDonald, Hayden Birdsong and Spencer Bivens — will be pushed back.\nBefore the mound conditions deteriorated, Harrison’s fastball sat in the mid-90s, he landed sliders for strikes and, for the second straight outing, used his changeup as an effective third offering.\t\t\t\t\n“I’ve seen him a few times, but today — changeup, breaking ball, fastball — guys were having a tough time getting a good swing and (he was) using all his pitches,” Melvin said. “It’s the best I’ve seen him throw.”\nWith Chapman and fellow Gold Glove winner Nick Ahmed lined up behind him, Harrison was the first beneficiary of a potentially elite defensive infield.\nAfter he surrendered a double to Miguel Rojas, the Dodgers were threatening to score in the first inning when Teoscar Hernandez lined a ball into the hole between second and third. Chapman dove to his left, coming up empty, but Ahmed picked the ball ranging to his right, forcing Rojas to remain at third.\nHarrison recorded his second strikeout to end the inning unscathed, freezing James Outman with a 94-mph fastball on the outside corner.\n“You want to keep that ball on the infield so the run doesn’t score,” Melvin said. “In Chappy’s case, too, that’s maybe a ball he gets to sometimes. It’s gonna be a little bit before he gets his legs underneath him, but between the two of them it seems like we can cover some ground over there.”\nMany of the Giants’ top prospects will take on the best of the A’s farm system next Friday in a new twist to the spring schedule this year.\nThe rosters for the first annual “Spring Breakout” games were revealed Thursday, with Rayner Arias and Bryce Eldridge highlighting the Giants’ group.\nArias, 17, was one of the top international prospects when he signed out of the Dominican Republic in 2022, while the Giants drafted Eldridge 16th overall out of high school in last summer’s draft. Also slated to participate are shortstops Walker Martin, last year’s second-round selection, and Maui Ahuna, taken two rounds later.\nNot limited to only recent draftees, Hunter Bishop, Farhan Zaidi’s first first-round pick, is also scheduled to play after dealing with a string of injuries to begin his career.\nFirst pitch is scheduled for 4:05 p.m. next Friday, March 15, at Hohokam Stadium in Mesa, following the Giants’ Cactus League tilt against the A’s.\nThe list of tentative participants, in full: RHP Hayden Birdsong, RHP Josh Bostick, RHP Trevor McDonald, RHP Manuel Mercedes, RHP Mat Olsen, RHP Carson Ragsdale, RHP Landen Roupp, LHP Juan Sanchez, RHP Carson Seymour, LHP Joe Whitman, C Onil Perez, C Adrian Sugastey, SS Maui Ahuna, 1B Bryce Eldridge, SS Cole Foster, SS Walker Martin, SS/2B Diego Velasquez, OF Rayner Arias, OF/1B Victor Bericoto, OF Hunter Bishop, OF Vaun Brown, OF Jonah Cox, OF Grant McCray.\n— UTIL Blake Sabol will be sidelined for at least the next two weeks after straining his groin Tuesday against the Brewers. Sabol was attempting to beat out an infield single when he felt the muscle pull, and an MRI early Wednesday morning revealed the sprain — and cost Sabol a rare chance to sleep in.\n— RHP Sean Hjelle (elbow) also underwent imaging on his elbow, which revealed a sprain but no structural damage. While Hjelle said the timing was a tough blow, likely taking him out of the running to fill the fifth spot in the rotation, the outcome was the “best-case scenario” after feeling discomfort in his elbow in the days following his most recent outings.","length":4882,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T02:59:04Z","rating":[7,5,8,6,7,7,6],"reason":"The article provides a detailed account of Matt Chapman's debut for the San Francisco Giants cut short by rain and Kyle Harrison's performance.

Then, Ferrari’s Carlos Sainz and Charles Leclerc passed him too, and there wasn’t much he could do about it.

So it’s been a bit of a strange day.”\nRussell’s words stemmed from the fact that Mercedes entered the Bahrain GP with great hope. They were strong in pre-season testing and practice ahead of the race too. Unfortunately, for Russell, the Ferrari cars were too fast. Hamilton meanwhile, couldn’t make too many places either.

The only drivers he managed to get the better of were McLaren’s Oscar Piastri and Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso.\nAdmittedly, Alonso and Piastri were not driving the fastest of cars. He passed Alonso fairly easily and was on a better strategy than Piastri who put him in front. However, he couldn’t do anything to threaten Lando Norris, or anyone ahead of him.\nAs quoted by the BBC, Hamilton said, “I think there is a feeling of disappointment within the team. “I thought we would have been better today than we were.

This can have many causes, from a cruciate ligament injury in the knee to mobility problems after a stroke. Musculoskeletal models could be used to assess people with suboptimal movement patterns. These models simulate the function of muscles, and the load on bones and joints to better understand movement. This can help with rehabilitation, for example by learning to use the muscles differently.\n However, musculoskeletal models in research are now based on the body of an average male. Scientists from TU Delft, Department of Mechanical Engineering, investigate how accurate these models are for a broad population. The one-size-fits-all approach could hinder proper treatment by doctors and physiotherapists. The researchers are therefore working on personalized musculoskeletal models based on a simple 3D scan.\nIn an ideal world, you would have a fully personalized model of each individual. In medical practice, this is not feasible. The process is time-consuming, expensive, and requires an MRI scan. Therefore, a standard model is used and then scaled as accurately as possible to an individual's body shape. Research by Ph.D. candidate Judith Cueto Fernandez and Eline Van der Kruk, assistant professor of Biomechanical Engineering, shows how inaccurate this can be. \"If you compare the existing approach with a fully personalized model, you see deviations of 15% to 20%,\" says Van der Kruk.\nYou don't need to have an exceptional or unusual build for this: Existing musculoskeletal models also fall short for women. Why is that? The standard model is based on the skeleton of an average man. This deviation can become problematic when you base treatments on this model. \"Imagine you are recovering from a cruciate ligament injury and have an asymmetrical load on your knees,\" says Cueto Fernandez. \"In that case, this asymmetry could go unnoticed, or overestimated. In that case, you cannot accurately measure the effect of a treatment.\"\nThere is not yet a generic model for women, but for the researchers, it's about much more. \"Ideally, you have a model that matches your physique as closely as possible, but that is currently not the case for men and women,\" says Van der Kruk.\nWhy is it that the generic models are only based on an average man? \"Globally, only 28% of engineering graduates are women and because the research topics are chosen personally, you naturally get more male-dominated topics,\" she explains.\n\"You also see that the research participants are more often male. They are often recruited at technical universities themselves, where there are simply more male students. There are also more male researchers and they sometimes find it an uncomfortable idea to have a woman in a sports bra in their lab. So this type of practical reasons can play a role.\"\nThe researchers are now working on more representative models. Participants in the study receive a full-body MRI scan and their movements are monitored in the lab. The goal of the project is to make it easier to generate personalized musculoskeletal models. At the same time the research shows the limitations of using the \"generic model.\" The researchers are training algorithms to estimate the shape of the skeleton and muscle properties based on body shape. Van der Kruk says, \"The ultimate goal is that in the future, with a 3D scan of a few seconds, you can create a personalized model.\"\nThis would mean that a doctor or physiotherapist could easily create a model themselves to better treat the patient, without the need for an MRI scan. According to Van der Kruk, this is becoming increasingly urgent. \"With the rapid development of AI-based movement analyses, you can now even register movements with an app on your phone. But this software is based on existing models and is therefore not reliable enough to assess what is happening inside the body and thus does not do justice to the diversity of bodies and varying movement patterns among people.\"\nThe clear link with medical practice is precisely why Cueto Fernandez finds her Ph.D. research so satisfying. \"It is very easy to see the practical application. We are not working on an abstract concept that might make a difference in 20 years. If things speed up a bit, this technology could improve medical practice.\"\n Developing personalized musculoskeletal models that reflect the diversity of body types (2024, March 7)\n This document is subject to copyright.

Police have objected to that move, with a fresh panel to be held next week, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Licensing Constable Nicola Ireland raised concerns regarding the transfer to Right-Step Ltd. In a written submission, she said such a move would undermine licensing objectives of prevention of crime and disorder and questioned the role of Mr Harris in a new operation, which would mean \"no material change to the operation\".PC Ireland added that there was \"no indication\" Right-Step Ltd had experience in running a licenced city centre premises, \"which was a contributory factor in the failures of the previous premises licence holder.\" Mr Harris' licensing agent Karl Barry said his client did not have to explain why the licence was being transferred and had done so immediately before the initial hearing in January.Why not follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X and Instagram?

Shifting planned production of the forthcoming R2 model to an existing facility in Illinois will allow Rivian to begin deliveries in the first half of 2026, earlier than expected. The surprise announcement plunges the high-profile factory project into uncertainty, but Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe said it remains important to the company.Shares of the automaker jumped after the announcement and closed up 13% on the day for their biggest gain since December. The stock had fallen more than 50% this year through Wednesday on concerns over Rivian’s cash and consumer demand for its products.Rivian in 2022 secured a $1.5 billion package of state and local incentives — the biggest in Georgia’s history — to build the massive plant outside Atlanta. The company pledged at the time to create 7,500 jobs by the end of 2028, winning praise from local lawmakers.Read More: Rivian to Issue Up to $15 Billion of Debt for Georgia PlantThe retreat comes two weeks after Rivian announced job cuts and said it would keep production flat this year, falling well short of expectations and triggering a heavy selloff in the shares. The company has struggled to transition to mass production since going public in 2021, and the high prices of its models have been a hard sell as overall demand for EVs fades. Rivian has never made a profit and it lost more than $40,000 on every vehicle it delivered in last three months of 2023.The new model helps fortify Rivian’s “unique brand identity,” but the financial implications of a lower-priced EV remain murky for the company, Tom Narayan, an RBC Capital Markets analyst, said in a note.“Currently, R1 is losing money,” he said. “The critical question is how will Rivian be able to produce R2 profitably at the $45,000 price point?”Also on Thursday, Scaringe unveiled the long-anticipated R2, a mid-sized electric sport utility vehicle that will start at around $45,000. That’s about $30,000 less than Rivian’s existing SUV and just under the US average new car sticker price of more than $48,000.The two-row SUV will be available in two battery pack sizes, with the larger option offering a range of more than 300 miles on a single charge. Customers can chose from one, two or three motor variants of the SUV.

However, a potential breakout from a key technical pattern suggests a bullish outlook for the token in the near future.Is XRP Poised for a Price Surge?According to CoinMarketCap data, XRP’s price climbed 19% over the past month. Despite the overall positive weekly trend, it only managed a 1.25% increase, and on the daily chart, it actually displayed an 8.5% decline. The token is currently trading at $0.5960.Analysts at World of Charts, a popular crypto research handle, recently identified a bullish triangle pattern on XRP’s chart.

Despite the recent price rise, XRP’s social media engagement has declined. However, the token’s weighted sentiment remains positive, indicating that overall market sentiment leans bullish.Several other metrics support the potential for a bull run. The MVRV ratio gauges market capitalization relative to realized value and suggests a potential price increase. The token’s network growth has also increased, indicating new user adoption. Furthermore, the positive funding rate in the derivatives market points towards dominant buying pressure.Bullish Long-Term, Uncertain Short-TermHowever, XRP’s daily chart indicators offer a contrasting view, hinting at a potential price correction in the short term. The Bollinger Bands indicator suggests the price may be nearing a peak, and the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) has dipped slightly. However, the bullish crossover on the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator contradicts the bearish signals.Ultimately, XRP’s future price movement remains uncertain. While the potential breakout from a bullish pattern and several positive on-chain metrics suggest a price surge, short-term technical indicators hint at a possible correction. Investors should closely monitor XRP’s price action and conduct their own research before making investment decisions.On the Flipside\nWhile analysts identify a bullish triangle pattern, it doesn’t guarantee a breakout.\nWhile some, like the bullish triangle and MACD crossover, suggest a potential rise, others, like Bollinger Bands and CMF, hint at a possible correction.\nThe ongoing legal battle between Ripple and the SEC casts uncertainty over XRP’s future, potentially hindering its adoption and price growth.\nWhy This MattersWhile XRP’s weekly performance lags behind the broader market, a potential breakout from a bullish pattern and positive on-chain metrics suggest a possible price surge despite conflicting short-term technical indicators.

Unlike traditional thrillers, which primarily focus on physical danger and high-stakes scenarios, psychological thrillers delve into the minds of their characters, exploring the darker, more intricate facets of human psychology. Today, we'll unpack the psychological thriller genre, offering insights into its definition, characteristics, and standout examples from film and TV that have left an indelible mark on the industry.Let's get started. \n MindhunterNetflixA psychological thriller is a genre that combines elements of suspense, thriller, and psychological fiction. It emphasizes the mental states of its characters, often incorporating themes of reality, perception, mind, and identity. These narratives are designed to elicit strong emotional responses from the audience, using tension, dread, and ambiguity to keep viewers on the edge of their seats. \n The Haunting of Hill HouseNetflixPsychological thrillers, a genre celebrated for its exploration of the human psyche, employ a variety of tropes to captivate and unsettle audiences. These tropes, or recurring themes and devices, are crucial in building suspense, developing characters, and propelling narratives. Here's a look at some of the most prevalent. Unreliable Narrator: This trope involves a narrator whose credibility has been seriously compromised. It keeps audiences guessing about the truth of the narrative, as the storyteller might be distorting reality due to mental instability, personal bias, or deliberate deception.Twisted Reality: Psychological thrillers often play with the concept of reality, using hallucinations, dreams, or altered perceptions to blur the lines between what is real and what is imagined. This can lead to a deep sense of unease and confusion, both for characters and viewers.Obsession: Characters in psychological thrillers frequently become obsessed with a person, idea, or object. This obsession drives the plot and leads to increasingly dangerous and erratic behavior, highlighting the dark side of human nature.Paranoia: Characters may feel an intense, irrational distrust of others, believing they are being persecuted or conspired against. This paranoia can escalate the tension in the narrative, leading to dramatic confrontations and revelations.Identity Crisis: Questions of identity are central to many psychological thrillers. Characters may struggle with their sense of self, experience identity theft, or encounter doppelgängers, leading to existential crises and confusion.Psychological Manipulation: This involves one character manipulating another for personal gain, revenge, or sheer enjoyment, often leading to a power struggle between the manipulator and their victim.Isolation: Characters are often isolated—either physically, psychologically, or both—heightening the sense of vulnerability and making the psychological aspects more intense. Isolation can be a literal confinement or a more metaphorical social or emotional detachment.The Descent into Madness: A common narrative arc involves a character's gradual descent into insanity, often portrayed through their perspective to immerse the audience in their deteriorating mental state.Moral Ambiguity: Characters in psychological thrillers often operate in a grey moral area, where right and wrong are not clearly defined. This ambiguity challenges audiences to question their own moral compass and the nature of justice.The Hidden Enemy: Unlike traditional thrillers that may feature a clear antagonist, psychological thrillers often present the enemy as hidden or reveal that the protagonist themselves may be their own worst enemy due to internal conflicts.Non-Linear Storytelling: The use of non-linear narratives can reveal key information about characters and events in a disjointed manner, creating suspense and gradually piecing together the mystery.Mind Games: Characters engage in psychological warfare, using intellect and deception to outmaneuver their opponents. This can involve complex plots, traps, and strategic misdirection.Complex Characters: Protagonists and antagonists in psychological thrillers are often deeply layered, with their motivations, sanity, or perception of reality coming into question.PlotTwists: The use of unreliable narrators, sudden plot twists, and non-linear storytelling techniques keeps audiences guessing.Tone: A dark, brooding atmosphere, complemented by a tone that emphasizes suspense and mystery, is pivotal.\n PsychoUniversalThis genre offers audiences deep, often unsettling insights into the complexities of the human mind and the mysteries of the human condition.Let's look at a few examples you should check out. Psychological Thriller MoviesThe psychological thriller genre has given rise to some of cinema's most unforgettable films. Psycho (1960) by Alfred Hitchcock: Often cited as the progenitor of the psychological thriller genre, Psycho explores themes of identity, madness, and voyeurism. Hitchcock's masterful use of suspense and the unexpected twist has set a precedent for future thrillers.Fight Club (1999) by David Fincher: This film delves into identity, chaos, and the dissolution of society through the eyes of its disillusioned narrator, offering a critique of consumer culture while engaging in psychological manipulation.Black Swan (2010) by Darren Aronofsky: A haunting exploration of ambition, competition, and identity within the high-pressure world of ballet, Black Swan blurs the lines between reality and hallucination, creating an intense psychological experience.Psychological Thriller TV ShowsThe television landscape has also embraced the psychological thriller, producing series that explore complex narratives over longer periods. Breaking Bad (2008-2013): While primarily a crime drama, the series delves deep into the psyche of its protagonist, Walter White, exploring themes of power, corruption, and transformation in a suspenseful narrative.Mindhunter (2017-2019): This series examines the psychology of serial killers and the FBI agents tasked with understanding them, blending real historical cases with a deep dive into the nature of evil and obsession.The Haunting of Hill House (2018): A modern reimagining of Shirley Jackson's classic novel, this series explores psychological horror through the lens of family trauma, grief, and haunted memories, effectively using the supernatural as a metaphor for mental anguish.The psychological thriller genre remains a vital and evolving component of film and television, captivating audiences with its exploration of the human condition. Through a combination of suspenseful storytelling, complex characters, and thematic depth, these narratives challenge our perceptions and engage us on a deeply emotional level. As filmmakers and TV creators continue to explore the vast landscapes of the human psyche, the psychological thriller genre promises to keep us enthralled, unsettled, and always questioning the nature of reality.Let me know all about your mental anguish in the comments.","length":7488,"publishedTime":"2024-02-27T18:03:03Z","rating":[7,8,8,6,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides a comprehensive overview of the psychological thriller genre in movies and TV, highlighting its defining characteristics, popular tropes, and standout examples.

Taran Adarsh rates it highly for drama, thrills, and unpredictability.\n The movie “Shaitaan,\" a supernatural thriller based on black magic, featuring actors Ajay Devgn, R Madhavan, and Jyotika, was theatrically released on Friday. \n Directed by Vikas Bahl, the film also stars Janki Bodiwala and Aangad Raj. Following its release, here's a glimpse of the public's reaction to the film. \t\t\t\t\n Taking on X, Taran Adarsh wrote, \"Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐️ Drama. Thrills. Chills. Shock-value. All enveloped in a near-perfect, captivating plot… This is supernatural genre done right… Unpredictable twists and turns are a big plus… Watch it! The written material gives ample scope to the principal cast to spread their wings… #AjayDevgn excels as the helpless parent; conveys fear, concern and vulnerability with precision… #RMadhavan is outstanding; he is savage, vicious and sadistic, all combined, without going overboard. It’s a delight to watch #Jyotika on the #Hindi screen after a really long gap. She’s in super form… #JankiBodiwala gets to portray the most difficult part in the film and she does a brilliant job. Director #VikasBahl charters into the supernatural territory for the first time and the execution of the subject keeps you on tenterhooks for most parts… Only thing, the post-interval portions could’ve been sharper and tighter.

The film has 7 to 8 edge-of-the-seat episodes, followed by an impactful finale act (last 30 minutes). Watch out for the pre-interval sequence and the third act of the film in the second half featuring “Daughter & Son\".\" \n It further read, “Shaitaan is among those rare supernatural films that can be watched by families too.\" He added, “Vikas Bahl adapts the Gujarati Film, Vash to perfection and the major rewriting in the climax makes the film palatable to a wider section of the audience.

Por-tu-gal!” and “Che-ga! Che-ga!”. By the time he took his seat, fans were jabbing the air with their fingers splayed in victory signs and chorusing “Ven-tu-ra! Ven-tu-ra!”.Diamantino de Sá Alves, 73, a retired member of Portugal’s gendarmes, the National Republican Guard, had been waiting for Ventura’s arrival, a Chega scarf around his neck and a party banner in his hand.“The reason I’m here tonight is very simple,” he said. “I’ve voted for every party out there but I think that currently Chega is the one that offers the best option for change.” He said Ventura was the only politician in parliament “whose words the Portuguese people can truly understand”.The Chega leader is certainly frank when it comes to his bugbears. Over the course of his 20-minute speech in Mouçós, he railed against road tolls, rapists, paedophiles, political cronyism, called the rightwing electoral platform the Democratic Alliance a “Spanish brothel”, and told the audience they were the country’s “last hope”.Chega party supporters wave flags at the event in Mouçós. Photograph: Gonçalo Fonseca/The GuardianVentura said Sunday’s election was about challenging “50 years of corruption” since Portugal’s return to democracy, “50 years of taxes that were used to support parasites” and a stale political status quo that had destroyed the country’s self-esteem.Notably absent from Ventura’s jeremiad were any new attacks on Portugal’s Roma population, a community he has previously attempted to demonise as having “a chronic problem of dependence on benefits, delinquency and violence”. Nor was immigration – a big issue for many Chega voters – on his mind that night.He chose instead to focus on his party’s possible breakthrough. “Never in the history of Portugal has there been a greater possibility of overthrowing the bipartisan system that has been killing us for the past 50 years,” he said. “We have never been this close.”Ventura’s leveraging of political disenchantment and fears over corruption is hardly surprising. Dissatisfaction with the PS, which has run the country for the past eight years, has been exacerbated by Portugal’s housing crisis, stressed public services, low wages and a series of corruption scandals.The early election was triggered by the collapse of the socialist government of António Costa, who stepped down as prime minister last November amid an investigation into alleged illegalities in his administration’s handling of large green investment projects.Costa, who has not been accused of any crime and maintains he has a clear conscience, said he felt he had to step down because “the duties of prime minister are not compatible with any suspicion of my integrity”.Although Ventura was once a rising star in the conservative PSD before leaving the party to form Chega, he now seeks to portray his former colleagues as part of an old problem that only he can solve.André Azevedo Alves, a political scientist at the Catholic University of Portugal and St Mary’s University, London, attributes Chega’s continuing ascent – it took 1.3% of the vote in the 2019 elections and 7.2% in 2022 – to its adept harnessing of the prevailing mood.“It’s Ventura sensing that there is a political opportunity because of this widespread discontent with the political class, left and right,” he said. “I think that’s one of the main things that Chega feeds on.”Prematurely or not, the mood in the banqueting hall in Mouçós was jubilant. Photograph: Gonçalo Fonseca/The GuardianWhile immigration may be a concern “for a significant chunk of the voters who would align with Chega”, he added, housing, public services and wages remain the key issues in the election – hence Ventura’s efforts to hammer the two biggest parties for their failure to improve things for the average Portuguese person.The other important factor in Chega’s rise, said Azevedo Alves, was Ventura himself. “I think part of the reason why you have had this Portuguese exception of not having a successful radical-right party is because until 2019, when Ventura first got into parliament, there wasn’t a skilled enough political entrepreneur who was able to capitalise on this,” he said.“You have had radical-right and far-right parties in Portugal in the past 50 years, but they’ve always failed to get into parliament. To be frank, it’s because they’ve been really odd.”Ventura, in contrast, is slick, plausible – and pragmatic rather than deeply ideological. “He knows how to shift his pitch to appeal to different groups of voters,” Azevedo Alves said. “Personally, I don’t think he’s very ideological at all – and I think that’s also an important difference when you compare Ventura with other radical-right leaders in Europe.”That flexibility may be one of the drivers of Chega’s growth. While the typical Chega voter at the last election was disproportionately male and in their mid-30s to mid-50s, things are moving, especially among younger people.The party’s most recognisable face after Ventura is a 25-year-old MP and self-declared anti-feminist called Rita Matias, who was also rapturously received in Mouçós. Surveys suggest Chega’s social media push and campus events are paying off: according to polls, it is now the most popular party among Portuguese people aged 18-34.André Ventura, Rita Matias (right) and other Chega candidates sing along to the national anthem at the event in Mouçós. Photograph: Gonçalo Fonseca/The GuardianAmong those attending the Mouçós event was Cátia Baptista, a 21-year-old law student who said she felt her post-graduation future would probably lie elsewhere. “Portugal is a country where it seems that only the PS and the PSD exist but Portugal is also not a very good country to live in,” she said. “The people who can afford it go abroad to work.”Although the PSD’s leader, Luís Montenegro, has categorically ruled out any deal with the far-right party, dismissing Ventura’s views as “often xenophobic, racist, populist and excessively demagogic”, Chega is quietly confident that it has the momentum it needs to play a major role in ushering Portugal’s next government into office.Azevedo Alves said: “If there’s a clear majority on the right, I don’t think Montenegro will go back on his word and reach out to Ventura for a deal. But I do think that there will be huge pressure on the right not to allow the defeated socialist party to continue in power because the parties on the right can’t find any form of agreement.”Prematurely or not, the mood in the banqueting hall in Mouçós was jubilant and the event included a post-dinner dance. One of the last songs played – and heartily sung along to – was not a Phil Collins number but Da Vinci’s Conquistador. Portugal’s catchy 1989 Eurovision entry, the song speaks of “raising proud flags”, lists Portugal’s colonial conquests, from Brazil to Angola and from Goa to Macau, and reminds the listener “I was once a conqueror”.Earlier in the evening, while waiting for the guest of honour to appear, one of the attenders said he was sick of hearing Chega described as a bunch of far-right extremists.“We all have the right to have a voice, and when people criticise us and write us off, they’re discriminating against us,” said Luís Teixeira, 32, a salesperson. “We’re not the ones who are backing away from the PSD, it’s the PSD that has backed away from us. We’ve given them a lot of chances but they don’t represent us. What André Ventura wants is to bring that party towards our ideas and into our fold.”","length":9426,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T05:00:44.000Z","rating":[8,7,8,6,9,7,8],"reason":"The article provides a comprehensive overview of the political landscape in Portugal, focusing on the rise of the far-right Chega party led by André Ventura.

The Supreme Court will hear arguments on April 25 in the blockbuster case over whether Trump may claim immunity from prosecution in the federal election subversion case. Separately, Trump’s New York criminal trial is slated to begin on March 25 in which he is charged with felonies related to hush-money payments made to his former attorney Michael Cohen ahead of the 2016 election. The former president’s attorneys are now trying to cast doubt on the allegations and limit what can go before the jury when the trial begins. Meanwhile, prosecutors in Arizona have issued several grand jury subpoenas in recent weeks to people connected to efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election in that state. In that case, like the rest, timing is critical: Movement in the Arizona case suggests the state-level probe is accelerating ahead of November’s presidential election.\n A Russian missile exploded close to a convoy carrying Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis during a deadly attack on the Ukrainian city of Odesa yesterday. The leaders were unharmed, but the strike killed five people and wounded others. Zelensky frequently makes high-risk trips to the front lines and has welcomed dozens of world leaders to Ukraine during the war with Russia, but this attack may represent one of the closest calls for the president. The strike’s proximity to Mitsotakis, who is the leader of a NATO member state, also underlines the potential global repercussions of the conflict.\n Extreme hunger is adding to the death toll as the war in Gaza continues. At least 20 people, including children, have died in Gaza due to malnutrition and dehydration since the war began, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. Israel’s severe restrictions on aid have drained essential supplies. Almost 40% of UN aid missions in Gaza were denied or impeded by Israel last month, the organization said. Hospitals have been besieged by violence, and health professionals say the medical system has been completely crushed, allowing no relief for people in need of care. The Ministry of Health in Gaza said this week that since the beginning of the war, 364 health workers had been killed; 269 medical staff arrested; 155 health facilities “destroyed,” and 155 ambulances “targeted.” CNN cannot independently confirm the numbers due to the lack of international media access to Gaza.\n 'We have nothing': Children face starvation in Gaza as supplies run out\n Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey signed a bill into law aimed at protecting in vitro fertilization patients and providers from legal liability after an unprecedented February ruling severely disrupted the future of fertility care in the state. Last month, the state’s Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are human beings and those who destroy them can be held liable for wrongful death. The ruling prompted three of the state’s limited pool of IVF providers to immediately pause some services, sending some families out of state for treatment and raising new concerns nationwide about reproductive rights. While the Republican-backed legislation will provide civil and criminal immunity, experts say it doesn’t fully address the philosophical and practical problems brought by the court’s ruling.\n The armorer on the set of the movie “Rust” was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the 2021 on-set fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. Hutchins was killed by a live round of ammunition fired from a prop gun held by actor Alec Baldwin. The incident raised questions about the movie industry’s safety standards and, more specifically, what violations occurred on the set. Hannah Gutierrez Reed was responsible for firearm safety and storage on the film’s set and is the first person to stand trial as a result of the shooting. Prosecutors argued Gutierrez Reed repeatedly violated safety protocol and acted negligently in performing her duties, and that her actions ultimately led to Hutchins’ death. Baldwin, who has also been charged with involuntary manslaughter, is expected to stand trial in July. He has pleaded not guilty and claims he did not pull the trigger.\n What guilty verdict against 'Rust' armorer may mean for Alec Baldwin\n Applebee’s is shrinking.

After pleading guilty to wire fraud and illegal monetary transactions in December, Patel, 31, is set to be sentenced on Tuesday.Prosecutors are recommending a seven-year sentence for Patel, and said that it “would be fair and just in this case, given the immense scope of the defendant’s crimes and his recent efforts to shift the blame to his victim.”“The defendant was a trusted and valued member of Jaguars organization. He betrayed that trust and stole over $22 million through hundreds of fraudulent transactions, which he skillfully concealed for over three years. He did not need that money. He did not use it to feed his family or care for sick loved ones. He did not donate the loot to a charity or use it to perform good works. He had fun with it. He lived it up – gambling, traveling, and shopping. Under these circumstances, a lengthy prison sentence is warranted,” prosecutors wrote in the sentencing memo.MORE: How one ‘super basic’ man stole $22M from his hometown Jaguars and became ‘the biggest loser ever on FanDuel’In the filing, prosecutors laid out a money trail showing how Patel moved the millions he stole from the team’s virtual credit card program he oversaw to places like FanDuel, DraftKings and his personal PayPal account.How Amit Patel moved money from the Jacksonville Jaguars to personal accounts, according to prosecutors. (Copyright 2024 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.)Prosecutors said Patel used his role as the administrator for the Jaguars’ virtual credit card program to make hundreds of purchases and transactions with no legitimate business purpose. Then, to hide and continue to operate the scheme, he created and emailed falsified accounting records to Jaguars representatives, prosecutors said.Patel’s attorney said Patel spent 99% of the money stolen from the Jaguars on online gambling, but according to prosecutors, Patel spent more than $5 million on “personal expenses.”RELATED: Former Jaguars employee accused of stealing millions from team used most of the money to gamble on sports, attorney says | ‘Should have had oversight’: UNF experts analyze how ex-Jaguars employee got away with stealing millions for years | Ohio couple in town for MNF game say they got Uber ride from former Jaguars employee accused of stealing $22M from teamProsecutors said Amit Patel spent over $77,000 at the exclusive Ponte Vedra Beach Inn and Club, including a $25,581 initiation fee and $5,508 for spa services. (Copyright 2024 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.)Here are some of the places he made the largest purchases, in approximate amounts, according to prosecutors:Restaurants/Bars: $25,000Financial/Cryptocurrency: $2,100,000The Golf Auction, LLC: $201,000Ponte Vedra Inn & Club: $78,000Entertainment: $300,000 (including $69,000 on Ticketmaster and $63,000 on StubHub)Photos showed Patel sipping a cocktail at Ponte Vedra Inn & Club, lounging in the ocean at a Formula 1 event in Miami and holding Givenchy shopping bags while in London with the Jaguars.Prosecutors said Patel transferred over $17 million straight from the Jaguars VCC account to his PayPal account and directly transferred another $2.8 million and $1 million to FanDuel and DraftKings, respectively.Now all of that money is gone.Patel’s attorney said Patel had a gambling addiction, and ESPN reported that Patel was known as “the biggest loser ever on FanDuel.”But prosecutors attacked the characterization laid out by Patel’s attorney.They noted that Patel took the unusual step of issuing a press release the week before he pleaded guilty.“The defendant’s press release is a remarkable document. It presumably previews the defendant’s sentencing arguments, which are largely without an evidentiary basis,” prosecutors wrote. “In his press release, the defendant dismissed the notion that he stole and spent the $22 million ‘to live an extravagant lifestyle.’ Instead, he casted himself as a tragic figure who engaged ‘in a horribly misguided effort to pay back previous gambling losses,’ specifically, by stealing even more money and then gambling it in hopes of winning, but ultimately losing. In support of this claim, he alleged that ‘[a]pproximately 99%’ of the money that he stole was lost gambling on the FanDuel and DraftKings websites. This claim – which appears to be a centerpiece of the defendant’s sentencing argument – is deceptive.”Patel’s press release, prosecutors said, did not disclose that he continued to lead his luxurious lifestyle even after the fraud was discovered and he was fired by the Jaguars.The week before he pleaded guilty, prosecutors said, he paid for the Trevor Lawrence jersey using the money he stole.Amit Patel shopping and dining out during a trip to London with the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2022. (Copyright 2024 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.)“The defendant could have been gathering assets or saving money to try to pay some restitution to the Jaguars; instead, he was shopping on the internet, golfing, and getting spa treatments. His actions are contrary to the claim in his press release that ‘[h]e has fully cooperated, and will continue to cooperate, with the Jacksonville Jaguars,’” prosecutors wrote. “He should admit how he actually spent the money he stole and accept responsibility for all of his egregious conduct. To date, he has not.”Prosecutors noted that Patel claimed that the only reason his scheme was not detected over the three and a half years he was doing it was because nobody at the Jaguars reviewed the credit card statements or adequately supervised him.“This is victim-blaming at its worst,” prosecutors said. “As the MBA-trained, financial professional and the administrator of his employer’s credit card program, the defendant was the one minding the till. He was best positioned to spot the fraud. He had an obligation to structure the program to prevent losses. Instead, using insider information, he identified a vulnerability and exploited it. He stole from the company hundreds of times and went to elaborate lengths to cover it up for several years.”All of these factors played into the recommended sentence. Patel still faces the possibility of 30 years in prison.Shannon Schott, an attorney not associated with the case, said the government is using the statement from Patel’s attorney to make their case for a lengthy prison sentence.“They’re really emphasizing everything he did when he was stealing this money, and also how sophisticated the stealing was, and that he knew that this was wrong. And he was actually taking steps to cover up for three years what he was doing,” Schott said.Doctor Justin D’Arienzo is a clinical and forensic psychologist. While he hasn’t treated Patel, he said the behavior detailed in court documents points to a wide range of psychological behavior.“On the far end, you have somebody that is facing some financial stressor, or they’re in some jam, and then they need to escape it. And they have access to a lot of money. So they take a risk. And then on the far end, you have somebody that maybe is a sociopath, that takes things without guilt,” D’Arienzo said.Schott said the government seems to be trying to make an example of Patel.“Even if he’s a first-time offender, it doesn’t matter, because the amount and the sophistication and the length of time that this went on is so great that they’re not going to hold back when it comes to their recommendations for sentencing,” Schott said.Copyright 2024 by WJXT News4JAX - All rights reserved.","length":8333,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T21:00:01.849Z","rating":[2,3,5,2,7,4,3],"reason":"The article provides detailed information about Amit Patel's fraudulent activities and the extravagant lifestyle he lived with the stolen money.

Enjoy more audio and podcasts on iOS or Android.Your browser does not support the <audio> element.IT DOES NOT sound like an easy place to live. Scorched cars litter a desolate landscape. The city’s factories are struggling; workers are being laid off in droves. Worst of all, a serial killer is sowing terror.“Moses on the Plain”, a novella of 2016 by Shuang Xuetao, offers an unsparing portrait of life in China’s industrial north-east in the 1990s. It inspired a film adaptation in 2021 and a television series in 2023. (It has also been translated into English in a collection called “Rouge Street”.) In its various formats, the story is part of a phenomenon called the “Dongbei renaissance”. Dongbei is a collective term for China’s rust belt: the provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning. The region, once known in the West as Manchuria, has become a byword for urban decay. Yet precisely because of that, it is pushing to the forefront of Chinese popular culture.The provinces were once the country’s main manufacturing hub. In the 1950s a third of China’s biggest industrial projects originated there; workers enjoyed job security and good wages. But in the 1980s economic reforms broke the region’s monopoly on production; state-run outfits downsized to make way for private firms. Mass redundancies followed in the 1990s. In 2001 8.3% of the north-east’s labour force was unemployed.Many Dongbei storytellers witnessed these ruptures firsthand. Mr Shuang, Ban Yu and Zheng Zhi, the genre’s most prominent novelists, all grew up in Liaoning and have chosen disaffected workers as protagonists. Their stories focus on hardscrabble lives shaped by crime, poverty and unrest. Mr Zheng has adapted one of his own novels about the murder of teenage girls into a television series, “Nobody Knows” (2022). Last year “The Long Season”, a drama about a murder case, was hugely popular. “The fascinating part of the story,” said one reviewer on Douban, a website, is “the destiny of factories and the north-east.”The trend echoes the rise of Hollywood noir in the mid-20th century, which evoked Americans’ anxieties in the wake of the Great Depression. As Kevin Grant, a film historian, has noted, the genre was characterised by its “misanthropic ethos and strong sense of fatalism; persistent motifs including entrapment and inescapability, treachery and retribution”.Dongbei fiction also articulates wider concerns about the social and economic malaise that millions of Chinese are experiencing. Characters are listless; some find solace in the bottle. Family relations are strained. In this way, the stories also share themes with “Hillbilly Elegy”, a memoir of growing up in a depressed steel town in Ohio by J.D. Vance, who elegised his way into the US Senate.Though set in the past, these tales resonate today. Decades later, people in Dongbei still struggle. It has the lowest birth rate of any region in China. The north-east’s GDP accounted for only 5% of the country’s total in 2023, compared with 13% on the eve of reform in 1978. And China’s whole economy is slowing, with a housing slump and shrinking consumer demand. Youngsters are disillusioned: the youth-unemployment rate in cities reached a record high of 21% last June. “We have started to understand losers,” Huang Ping, a professor at East China Normal University, has said.Mr Ban has suggested that literature offers a way to “look back and reflect on the trauma people might have experienced”. Recently a bookshop in Quanzhou, in the south-eastern province of Fujian, hosted an event dedicated to the genre. “We hope to use reading to battle forgetting,” the flyers read. For many Chinese, the things depicted in the pages of books are not distant memories but vivid and realistic.Dongbei stories are very different in tone, therefore, to those set in present-day China, which are often upbeat and embody the positivity and national pride demanded by Xi Jinping. Yet censors have left books and shows about the travails of Dongbei alone, perhaps because the government has also talked publicly for years about the region’s stagnation. The Dongbei renaissance draws attention to places left behind by the nation’s rise but also points to demand for honest, nuanced accounts of the real China. ■For more on the latest books, films, TV shows, albums and controversies, sign up to Plot Twist, our weekly subscriber-only newsletterExplore moreChinaThis article appeared in the Culture section of the print edition under the headline \"Hillbilly elegies\"Culture March 9th 2024Whoever gets the Best Picture Oscar, international films are winningInfatuation, kids, adultery: marriage is the theme of the OscarsMuseums have a hoarding problemStories about the Dongbei rust belt are resonant in ChinaGabriel García Márquez’s novella was published against his wishesFrom the March 9th 2024 editionDiscover stories from this section and more in the list of contentsExplore the edition","length":5034,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T14:18:49.334Z","rating":[8,7,9,7,8,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the Dongbei rust belt phenomenon and its cultural impact in China, drawing parallels with the rise of Hollywood noir.

 Not in relation to the nuclear contracts.  State law mandates that electric companies take the supply purchased through those contracts and sell it back into the competitive market, with customers receiving 100% of the revenues produced by that sale.  Over the past five years, the fixed contract costs paid out by Eversource totaled about $1.5 billion – and the revenues received from the market totaled about $1.48 billion, with a net cost for customers of $20 million.  In this model, electric utilities do not profit from the contracts — not even by a penny.  Instead, customers are the sole beneficiary of a state policy designed to stabilize rates in a volatile price market, while also serving a critical role in protecting the reliability of the bulk electric system and reducing carbon emissions.  All at a cost of about $1.50 per year for the average residential customer over the past five years.\nHow does this work?  New England is a deregulated market for electric supply.  Natural gas is the main fuel source used to generate electric supply, accounting for about 45% of the electric generation in New England.  This causes natural gas prices to be the single biggest driver of the cost of electricity.  In 2022, natural gas supplies were severely constrained in New England due to well-documented global supply issues.  High demand for natural gas caused price volatility, pushing the cost of electric supply skyward across New England.\nIn Connecticut, the electric companies sold the nuclear power they’re required to buy into the open market – which was high at the time – producing profits well above the fixed contract which, by law, are passed to customers through a supply credit on their bill.  In 2022, the net benefit to Eversource customers was in the range of $310 million, with dollars flowing to customers through a supply credit in 2023, lowering last year’s rates. \nWhy then, rate shock?  Current state regulatory policies prohibit the utilities from addressing market conditions on a real-time basis.  Contract costs and revenues are estimated at a single point in time – early in the year – looking backward.  When differences arise between estimated and actual costs, costs are pushed forward for collection in future periods to avoid rate impacts, while rate credits are accelerated and sometimes even over-paid to customers – requiring customers to pay the credit back.  In May 2023, state regulators held the “Public Benefits” rate at zero on customer bills rather than reflecting last year’s cost on last year’s customer bill.  Blackjack, anyone?\nAcross New England, state regulators are exploring ways to help customers manage the high volatility in electric supply prices due to natural gas constraints.  Connecticut had the foresight to lock into nuclear generating contracts to enable rate stabilization.  But that pragmatism has given way to rhetoric and muddying of the waters on the need for utilities to recover their costs.  Connecticut now has an ominous distinction:  No other state is experiencing the rate shock that Connecticut’s state regulatory policies are now producing.  Other states recognize that customer interests are best served where electric company costs are factored into customer rates on a systematic and predictable basis – consistent with state law and policy.\nHow do we fix this?  The complexities of the situation demand collaboration.  We have solutions to address this year’s rate shock and to stabilize the situation for customers going forward.  We are working closely with officials from Gov. Lamont’s office, the Office of Attorney General William Tong, the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection and the Office of the Consumer Counsel to find solutions.  We can get there working together with the facts and a common set of goals.  Let’s start now.","length":5508,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T16:09:15+00:00","rating":[7,6,8,7,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides accurate information regarding Connecticut's regulatory policies, electric rate increases, and the reasons behind them.

The additions are a testament to RM Machinery’s continued commitment to providing customized solutions to the commercial and package printing industries. \nSales for the northern and central regions of the United States will be handled by Mike Stock, an industry veteran based in Kansas City with a résumé that includes having worked for Mitsubishi Lithographic Presses (MLP) for more than two decades. With a background in mechanical engineering, Stock began his career at MLP as an engineer and eventually worked his way up the ladder to become vice president of sales for the company’s web and sheetfed press lines. His technical background and thorough understanding of the equipment made him the perfect candidate for RMM’s vice president of sales position. \n“Having Mike Stock on board is a privilege,” said Rahul Kaushik, owner of RM Machinery. “His expertise with the equipment combined with his sales experience will be extremely beneficial to our customers.” \nAs regional sales manager, Kelly Adams will lead the team’s customized solutions efforts in the southern and eastern regions of the United States from Merritt Island, Florida. Also a former MLP employee, Adams brings more than 30 years’ experience in the print manufacturing industry to RM Machinery’s table. His existing business relationships will prove invaluable to the team; he has already met with his customers on RMM’s behalf and received warm receptions. \n“Kelly is an enthusiastic individual and we are excited to have him join us,” said Lloyd Molloy, director of customer service for RM Machinery. “His time at Mitsubishi will allow him to make the transition to representing RMGT presses practically seamless.” \nLike Stock, Adams will be responsible for providing commercial and package printers with solutions from RMGT’s 10-Series line of offset presses, which includes the 1060 tandem perfector and 1060 wide stock press models. \nThe new marketing manager for RM Machinery is Stephanie Helsel who will help create and coordinate strategic marketing initiatives for the sales team.

Based in the company’s Carneys Point office, Helsel is looking forward to working with the RMM’s entire team and accompanying them on installations. \n“With our sales responsibilities expanding throughout the United States, we needed someone with a good work ethic to bring fresh ideas to our marketing agenda,” said Kaushik. “Stephanie was the perfect candidate for the job.” \nStepping into the role of senior manager–projects is industry veteran Dan Stratz who worked for both MLP and its competition. Strategically located in Hanover Park, Illinois, Stratz is prepared to be anywhere anytime and takes a hands-on approach to business. His vast knowledge of the mechanics behind an offset press is treasured by the team at RMM. Stratz tackled two installations simultaneously immediately after his start date. \n“Installations are second-nature to Stratz,” said Molloy. “He brings twenty-five years’ experience to RM Machinery and is extremely knowledgeable.” \nThe integration of the four new members into the RM Machinery family marks more than just an expansion—it's a reinforcement of a powerful legacy. With Mitsubishi Lithographic’s precision engineering at the heart of RMGT presses, RM Machinery is proud to carry this lineage into the future through its experienced team members, who share this core DNA.

Declutter detects and scans your photo library on your local device to find duplicates, screenshots, screen recordings, TikTok videos, app folders and blurred images. By default, all images are selected to be cleaned in one tap. But you can unselect some images before cleaning up your photo library.\nOrganize scans your photos for the last seven days, the last 30 days or a custom range. Once the scan is complete, you will see categories such as pets, travel, portraits, food and others. You can add all these photos to a new folder.\nIf you tap on a category, you will see “Similars” and “Uniques” options. Similars will have almost identical shots grouped together so you can remove either of them. In our testing, we saw that even photos with different filters or styles were grouped. That’s why you might want to have a look at some of the grouped photos before cleaning them. In the Uniques category, you might find some images that you can delete.\nIf you don’t want the app to scan certain images, you can mark them as sensitive. The next time the app performs a scan, it will ignore all these images.\nThe app also has a network speed test for some reason. While it’s a useful tool overall, it feels like a mismatch in this app. The company said it included this feature to provide “comprehensive utility like CleanMyMac” — the company’s Mac-focused app to free up storage. In recent years, CleanMyMac has become an all-in-one utility app with several maintenance and security tools.\nThe free version of CleanMyPhone has certain limitations, such as access to only the “Other” category for organization and no ability to mark content as sensitive. To unlock these features users can pay an annual fee of $24.99. The company said it is aiming to release a one-time fee later this year.\nMacPaw is also the company behind Setapp, a subscription service for macOS and iOS apps.

Reported by Yang Yang. Subtitles by Yang Yang, Tracie Barrett. \nDong Hui works on a wiry enamel work at her studio in Wujing.\nThe first time Dong Hui, a young artist of the Minhang District Folk Arts and Crafts Association, experienced the allure of wiry enamel was at its low end – a color-sand picture at a primary school craft class taught by her friend.\"They used color sands to replace enamel glaze due to limited budget,\" Dong said.\"The children's works were unadorned, but the craft nonetheless appealed to me. Later I had a chance to appreciate real wiry enamel artworks, and thought, 'That is what I will pursue'.\"Wiry enamel is a branch of the ancient cloisonne enamel. Cloisonne enamel, according to historic findings in the 1980s, was introduced to China during the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368) from Arabian countries.\nIt reached a development peak during the Jingtai Period (1450-1457) in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), and frequently used blue as its major color, hence its name jingtai lan (景泰蓝). The craft was at first a pursuit of royal craftsmen to make delicate utensils for imperial households, and later it spread into the folk society.Its procedures involve making the mold, pinching and attaching wires on a workpiece, infusing enamels into slots with a paint gun or a dropper, kilning, polishing and gilding.In wiry enamel, procedures are simplified, to include pinching and attaching wires, infusing enamels and cementing glues.The enamels, frequently using mineral stones like quartz, feldspar and fluorite as major components, also add borax powder to assist melting and several noble-metal oxides as colorants.Normally enamels of the same mesh size will be used together in a color scheme. Warm and cold colors will be coordinated, the entire color scheme will reflect the space hierarchy and usually eight or 10 colors will be adopted to express a gradient.Dong tried all means to learn the craft in Shanghai and later set out to Jinan, capital city of Shandong Province, to learn from an intangible culture inheritor.\"My master, who is also a national gift maker, gave me dozens of tips on doing wiry enamel, which otherwise I would have needed years to figure out,\" Dong, who has just returned from a recent trip, recalled.\"I used to try to enamel on a gourd and had trouble because the surface was a curve rather than a flat,\" she added. \"My master explained and it dawned on me that I could have attached the enamel bit by bit like on sequential tangent planes on that curving surface.\nA red piano featuring Dong Hui's enamel creation became a highlight at the Shanghaiskills 2023. In this artwork, Dong reproduced a heavy-color painting work by the renowned artist Li Shoubai, depicting the landmark architectures of Shanghai. \n\"And I learned a diverse category of glues ranging from crystal glue, filmic adhesive and polymer stabilizer, among others, in my study in Jinan. Some are used to cement enamels on a flat surface and some on a three-dimensional surface. One glue might be a total alternative to the other.\"After fully mastering the craft, Dong returned to her hometown Wujing of Minhang District and set up her own studio at its culture and sports center.Wires, like spider's threads, pour out through her fingers to form the glittering frames, the slots of which were later filled with diverse colors of enamels.In the recent Shanghaiskills 2023 from April to May, a red piano with enamel patterns was a highlight.It was a cooperative work by Dong and Chinese heavy color painting artist Li Shoubai.\nDong Hui's lotus-themed work, a creation inspired by Lianhua Road S. in her hometown.\nDong reproduced Li's heavy color painting work portraying Shanghai-style shikumen (stone-gate) buildings, the zigzag bridge of the Yuyuan Garden, the Lujiazui high-rises, China Art Palace, Shanghai Science and Technology Museum, Oriental Sports Center, Lingang New Area and other landmark architectures in Shanghai.In the 2023 Shanghai Citizens Art Festival, Dong was selected as its \"Most Beautiful Craftsman\" in its Yangtze River Delta Citizens' Handcraft Competition.In addition, she is also trying to apply cultural elements of Wujing to her wiry enamel works, including lotus themed works inspired from Lianhua Road S. and a recreation of carvings on a slate of the historic Shangyi Bridge of the town.\"It will be such an accomplishment if my works with Wujing cultural traces can strike a chord among the folks of my hometown, meanwhile the craft itself will be promoted in the area,\" said Dong.","length":4833,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,8,7,6,8,7,8],"reason":"The article provides factual information about Dong Hui and her work in wiry enamel art, detailing the history and techniques of the craft accurately.

When the location was announced, it was “a moment of celebration for us,” says Gopal Kumar, general manager of the Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary Koh Samui, a local spa resort.His excitement was understandable; the show has been a boon for tourism. The first season of the mystery, shot at the Four Seasons on Maui, led to a 386 percent increase in availability checks at the property. The second season drove tourists to Sicily. Sensing an opportunity, the Thai government heavily courted the show’s producers, offering them $4.4 million in tax incentives.Destination promoters are calling it “The White Lotus Effect.” It’s part of a larger trend in tourism known as “set-jetting,” in which travelers pick a destination because a TV show or movie was shot there. This isn’t new: Star Wars fans have been flocking to Death Valley (a.k.a. the planet Tatooine) since the 1970s, and New Zealand tourism estimates that one in five travelers visits because of theThe Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit.“The exposure is product placement,” explains Simon Hudson, a tourism professor at the University of South Carolina. “Or destination placement.” But that compelling place you saw onscreen might look and feel a bit different in person. Here’s how to couch your cinematic expectations with on-the-ground reality.Emily in Paris, Wednesday in BucharestSet-jetting has taken on a fevered pitch of late, Hudson reports, perhaps due to people binge-watching during COVID-19 lockdowns. Shows with memorable settings—Bridgerton, Emily in Paris, Squid Game—fed their wanderlust. “There was that pent-up demand for travel,” he says.Expedia’s Unpack ’24 Study, a report on global travel trends, found that two-thirds of worldwide tourists considered visiting a place because they saw it on a small or big screen. Netflix’s Wednesday was credited with a 150 percent spike in searches for Romania; Viator currently offers multiple tours of Bucharest featuring locations used in the series. Even more revealing, 39 percent of travelers surveyed actually booked those trips. (This perhaps prompted the Washington Post to publish a proposed tour of Alberta, Canada, inspired by the apocalyptic HBO series The Last of Us, “minus the zombies.”)Tourism promoters are even designing marketing plans around popular shows filmed or linked to their destinations. “There’s nothing else which can really offer that kind of platform to a global audience of potential travelers,” says Robin Johnson, global marketing director for Visit Britain. “You can go from a standing start to absolutely monumental interest.” In fact, later this year the British Film Commission will launch a marketing campaign, “Starring Great Britain,” to lure fans of shows like Ted Lasso, which was shot in southwest London. After Castle Howard was featured on Bridgerton, the estate in North Yorkshire saw a 3,400 percent increase in visits to their website from the 18-to-24-year-old demographic.(Travel to these six places if you love “Star Wars.”)Separating fact from fictionDo your research before leaving home, since set-jetters who arrive with certain expectations may be disappointed, Hudson says. He recalls fans of Captain Corelli’s Mandolin descending on Kefalonia, Greece, only to find the film’s sets had been dismantled. Notting Hill fans determined to enjoy the London park where Hugh Grant romanced Julia Roberts should plan accordingly, since the private Rosemead Garden is open to the public just once a year. Viewers who saw Poor Things and began plotting trips to Lisbon or Paris won’t find the film’s candy-colored landscapes: most scenes were shot in Budapest or on sound stages.New Zealand’s government, by contrast, invested in Hobbiton, a theme park where visitors can tour the actual The Lord of the Rings sets two decades after the first film’s release. Devotees of The White Lotus who check into San Domenico Palace, Taormina, where season two was filmed, will find it much the same as the show, down to the staff uniforms and a bar manager who played a restaurant maître d’ on TV. Want to stay in Jennifer Coolidge’s room? Book the Royal Suite.But even set-jetting destinations that deliver aren’t exact copies. At the San Domenico Palace, guests can’t just wander straight onto a sandy beach like Aubrey Plaza and Michael Imperioli seemingly did. The Italian hotel is perched on a cliff (hence the dramatic views), and while there’s a beach in Taormina, the one seen on screen is actually in Cefalù, 120 miles away on the northern coast of Sicily.People lounge in Luxembourg Gardens, where several scenes from Emily in Paris were filmed. Photograph by KRISTA ROSSOW, NAT GEO IMAGE COLLECTIONNetflix’s Emily in Paris prominently features a neighborhood bistro called Les Deux Compères which specializes in Normandy cuisine. Fans regularly pose outside the restaurant, which in real life is called Terra Nera. But it’s Italian, not French. (The pub featured on Ted Lasso is a real place—The Prince’s Head in Richmond—but like Cheers in Boston, the interior was shot on a soundstage.)In cases like these, set-jetters might benefit from consulting a travel agent. For fans of Emily in Paris, Virtuoso—an international network of high-end travel agents—tracked down the real chef from Normandy who consulted on the series, directing clients to Anona, his farm-to-table restaurant in Paris. James Bond aficionados can consult Black Tomato, which recently launched a customizable, luxe package with options like a London training session with Daniel Craig’s stunt double and a stop at a chateau in Champagne, France, to taste a rare La Grand Année vintage that Bond sipped in Casino Royale.“There are websites dedicated to showing you exactly where places were filmed,” says a Virtuoso spokesperson, Misty Belles. “But getting access is another thing altogether.”(Retrace Oppenheimer’s footsteps—and filming sites—around the U.S.)How film sites combat overtourismWhat if a flood of tourists ruins the very thing that captivated viewers in the first place? It’s a legitimate question the industry wrestles with. Thailand’s Maya Baya—which was featured prominently in Leonardo DiCaprio’s 2000 film The Beach—had to close to tourists for more than three years to stem the damage done to its coral reefs.Tourists sit along the rocks of Mount Srd, admiring the panoramic view of Dubrovnik’s walled Old Town. The Croatian city has experienced an influx of visitors since many scenes from Game of Thrones were filmed there.Photograph by JILL SCHNEIDER, NAT GEO IMAGE COLLECTIONDubrovnik experienced overcrowding in the wake of Game of Thrones. Croatia’s capital stood in for the show’s fictional King’s Landing and became such a popular destination that American Airlines added a direct flight from Philadelphia to Dubrovnik. The government welcomed the tourist dollars—$200 million from 2013 to 2018 by one estimate—but the influx of travelers put a strain on the city’s infrastructure and decency laws. (Thrones fans made headlines for stripping down naked and strolling through the center of town—an homage to one character’s infamous walk of shame.) At one point, Dubrovnik’s Old City was so overrun it was in danger of losing its status as a UNESCO World Heritage site, forcing the mayor to limit the number of daily tourists. Perhaps fearing the same, the government of Svalbard, Norway, declined a request from Tom Cruise’s Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning to film there.Courting tourists while preserving local charm is a delicate balance. Visit Britain’s Robin Johnson suggests travelers be curious. The way he tells it, his office hopes to use shows like Poldark (shot in Cornwall), Peaky Blinders (Birmingham), and Bridgerton (Bath) as Trojan Horses. For example, come for Harry Potter’s Platform 9 and 3/4 at London’s King’s Cross Station, stay for a trip to a smaller city. “The film location,” he says, “is the hook to then tell the broader story.”Expedia’s 2024 study predicted a spike in travel to Sydney, Australia—where the Mad Max prequel Furiosa—due out in May—was filmed. That report also cited interest in Surrey, England (thanks to HBO’s House of the Dragon), and Budapest (Dune: Part Two).If the new FX series Shōgun has people excited about a trip to Japan, that’s understandable.

Yes yes, as a part of the AEW roster (you pedantic poindexters). He’s gonna rescue Eddie Kingston from them damn Bucks! The Rainmaker is here and money’s falling from the rafters! The crowd is electric! Look at him go! He’s here to save the da… nope, he’s a heel. Welp. What a creep. It’s all being written out for you in real time. I hope you enjoyed this emotional hurly-burly. I now have heartburn and it’s Okada’s fault. Not a bad Dynamite follow-up so far to a very strong Revolution PPV. AEW’s definitely taken more of a backseat during the Road to WrestleMania, but then again everything has. My family, my health (both mental and physical), my taxes, and even my crow army that I’ve been slowly amassing every day by putting peanuts all over my driveway. Sorry, my beloved corvus battalion, I’ve not forgotten you. I still require your services. Specifically for revenge. By the way, anyone else love the Cole/McAfee pairing? It’s so loosey and goosey. Loosey-goosey, even. I enjoy any combo that allows for Cole to proudly don an ornate headdress of sprawling antlers while Pat calls him an a**hole to his face. Also, the choice to dig in and double down on Cole having some sort of antlers kink makes me want to binge-watch Hannibal with him. As I get ready to attend SmackDown here in Dallas tomorrow for the big Cody & Seth/Rock & Roman in-ring showdown -- where Rock is surely going to call the crowd out for being hot hot cowboy trash (when he should really just insult everyone’s driving because Dallas drivers are the absolute bottom-barrel vehicle operators in all of creation) -- I’m checking back in with WWE so we can remain synced up with the big main event saga.A few weeks back, I wrote that everything seemed pretty smooth now as long as we specifically forget the SmackDown from February 2. Nothing else was needed. No references needed to be made. It was kind of a clean and easy omission to make. And certainly not the biggest s*** we’ve ever had to mentally somersault around in order to make a wrestling storyline make sense. No one needed to address it. Especially in a promo. Especially in a video promo. Especially in a video promo lasting 21 minutes. That’s a full-ass sitcom folks, minus the commercials. That’s the episode of Seinfeld where George’s dad brings back Festivus, Kramer goes back to work at H&H, Jerry dates a “two-face,” and George creates The Human Fund in order to get out of getting people gifts. All so The Rock could explain why February 2 happened. At least the small slice of my brain that contains completionist particles is somewhat satiated. After all, Rock mentioned how disheartened Cody looked when he left the ring that night, which has now become the seed that’s seemingly sprouted everything.The Rock even called Pharoah a “goofy ass s**thead.” Which, to be fair, is fine. I know Cody, as well as much of the wrestling world, took exception to that but… honestly, folks. If you’re not absolutely ROASTING your own pet at every opportunity then wtf are you doing having a dopey, dependant, adorable animal in your domicile? I tell my cat five times a day I’m going to sell her and her wee walnut brain to the first traveling carnival that comes through town so they can charge two bits on the midway to see the dumbest fartface that ever lived. Learn how to communicate with your beloved furbabies, you freaks. The Rock’s latest gimmick addition though is the big bad “I’m your boss” threat. It began at the ‘Mania Kickoff in Vegas but then it was back in a big way on SmackDown when he was trash-talking Seth. Do we think The Rock’s done after ‘Mania? After all, he does have other fish to fry and smaller, Oscar-bait style films to try his hand at. There’s his tequila and his XFL and his energy drink and his athletic gear and all the frankenparts that make up the Dwayne Johnson brand-o-rama. \"The Rock says your hamster is cross-eyed and works for the Cartel!\"But what if he became the new Vince? No, not by being an insane grotesquery of heinous sexual abuse, but by just being the new corporate villain. Like, a long-standing one. Like Cody vs. Rocky is the new Austin vs. Vince. He’s the new “Authority” and the one who can make life hell for the hero. Sure, he’s kind of doing that already but if he’s out and gone after the next four weeks then… well, where’s the fun in that? And he wouldn’t even need to be on each week, obviously. Especially when he’s apparently available to cut How I Met Your Mother-length videos each week where he just berates dogs. Of course, Roman is going down hard at WrestleMania. But will Cody win both nights? Will he beat The Rock and Roman in the Night 1 tag match or lose first before beating Roman? Winning both nights would certainly get him more over, or as over, as Danielson was at ‘Mania 30. But losing to The Rock (Bloodline shenanigans, Seth could turn heel, etc.) before beating Roman could set us off on a much longer, rewarding Cody/Rock feud. So we should think about how we’d like to see Cody win? Do we want him beating Roman clean, one on one? Or do we want to see the chaos of Bloodline Rules blow up in Roman’s face? I feel like you can’t dangle that carrot without using it. A Bloodline Rules match kind of needs to happen simply because, well, it was mentioned. It's like Chekhov's Bloodline Rules* match at this point. I mean, The Cherry Orchard is basically Chekhov's Bloodline anyhow. *this is where I remind y'all that Chekhov's Gun doesn't mean something at the beginning will come back at the end, only that what is presented is only what is necessary and holds meaning.I suppose all of this, the dreaming of Rock carrying on as a GM-style villain long after ‘Mania, is a way of saying this story doesn’t end on Night 2. The Bloodline Cinematic Universe has been such an important ongoing thing that it can’t shut down in one night. The Rock is definitely going to wrest control of the group after Roman s**ts the bed (the table?), which means a Rock and Roman match is still called for. But will Cody and Roman, down the line, team up against The Rock? The Rock has come in like a wrecking ball. Like an f’n Thanos. And we may need a massive “On Your Left” moment to wipe him out. \"This is Citibank informing you that your personal banking information might have been leaked to the dark web.\"","length":6443,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T21:48:57.375Z","rating":[1,2,2,1,2,2,3],"reason":"The article lacks accuracy and objective analysis.

Raised crossings are widely seen as safer, but local authorities vary on their use.\nThe guidelines outline that the option with signs is suitable for roads or streets with volumes of traffic less than 500 vehicles per hour without a refuge island, or 750 vehicles per hour with a refuge island.\nThe option without any beacons or signs, called Type C, must be used with a raised crossing, only where the speed limit is 30 km/h, and there must be only one lane in each direction.\n...This is not a paywall.

Thank you.\nDavid O’Grady, principal adviser at the Regional and Local Roads Division of the Department of Transport said that working with the National Transport Authority (NTA) and Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) pilot schemes assessed the use of zebra crossings without Belisha beacons.\nIn a letter to councils, O’Grady said: “The objective of the pilot schemes was to increase the number of safe crossing locations for pedestrians and active travel use in a cost-effective and sustainable manner. By providing an alternative to the flashing beacons, new crossings could be quickly and easily implemented without the need for electricity connections and therefore reduce installation costs, construction time and ongoing operational costs.”\n“Following the conclusion of the pilot studies, it is recommended to introduce two new zebra crossingconfigurations for use under certain specified criteria. The first configuration includes a new sign RUS066, which can be used in lieu of belisha beacons at zebra crossings. The second configuration utilises the crossing without a sign in certain situations with tighter specified criteria,” he said. \nA sign without a high-vis background is also in the supporting legislation and also part of the trial, but it did not make it into the guidelines as a usable option. \nCouncils have been told that the 600mm sign included in the Type B options includes a fluorescent yellow border and this differs from normal high-vis or yellow backing board used sometimes to alert motorists to signs such as yield signs.\nThe guidelines note: “This fluorescent border may not be used around any other sign, nor may any backing board be manufactured using this colour. Where this occurs, Local Authorities will be asked to remove them as this colour and border has been designed for a specific purpose and to use them outside of their intended purpose will dilute their effectiveness in their intended use situations and potentially compromise safety.”","length":3875,"publishedTime":"2024-03-06T22:06:43+00:00","rating":[5,7,6,4,8,6,5],"reason":"The article provides factual information about the changes in zebra crossing regulations in Ireland, detailing the new options available for councils.

He was starting quarterback for the football team and 1,000-point scorer in basketball. But now it’s baseball season and it’s really Chye’s time to shine as a returning all-stater and MCC’s jack of all trades.\n“He can run, he can throw, he can hit, he can steal, he can bunt, he’s got great speed,” said Chris Carr, MCC’s sixth-year head baseball coach.\n“He’s the best player I’ve ever coached. Respect for coaches, respect for yourself, respect for other players, dedication – he has all those tools as well. It’s not just the five tools. He’s got all the tools outside of that as well. You pile that all together and he’s been the best athlete that I’ve had.”\nChye did it all last baseball season en route to being named a finalist for the CatchMark SportsNet West Michigan Conference Baseball Player of the Year award.\nThe left-handed hitter batted .560 with 14 doubles, six triples and three home runs, plus he stole 54 bases. On the mound, the right-hander finished 8-5 with a 1.08 ERA as he piled up 69 strikeouts against only nine walks. Primarily a shortstop but also an outfielder defensively, Chye posted a .953 fielding percentage.\nHaving been raised on a farm the last nine years, Chye is hands-on and a throwback type of guy. His keen hand-eye coordination and tireless work ethic have served him well and should continue to do so whenever his playing career is over and he settles into the welding trade.\nChye, who carries a 3.87 GPA, spends part of his school days at West Shore Community College in the welding program.\n“You’ve got to have really steady hands (for welding), so like hand-eye coordination,” Chye said. “If you mess up with your hands, like you’re using like a 6010, which you have to whip and pause, if you mess that up and go up on the wrong plate, you’re going to mess up the whole weld. That part of it’s not going to be as strong. If you’re not steady, it’s not going to be good – you’re not going to be able to do it.”\nChye, 18, is the eldest of Pat and Roxanne Chye’s four children. On the Chyes’ farm are about 30 cows, eight to 10 hogs, chickens and ducks.\nWill Chye and brother Michael, a seventh-grader at MCC, have honed their hand-eye coordination and sharpened their competitiveness with backyard games such as Blitzball.\nChye has grown up in the virtual era of technology and hand-held devices, but he really appreciates anything outdoors, including hunting. He and his father have made trips to Montana for mule-deer hunting.\nMason County Central quarterback Will Chye (2) scrambles during a game against Ravenna on Friday, Sept. 23, 2022, in Scottville, Mich. (Photo by Scott Robar for CatchMark)\n“You don’t want to be lazy all day and play on your phone, watch videos or whatever,” Chye said. “I like getting outside, like in the summertime playing Blitzball with my brother. That really works on hand-eye coordination, watching that ball move all over the place.”\nCarr, who works in heating and cooling and owns Chris Carr Mechanical in Scottville, spends a lot of time driving from job to job.\nCarr has noticed that in more recent years, it’s rare to see young people playing baseball or other sports outdoors. But that was one of Carr’s first impressions of Chye.\n“His dad had an AC problem, called me up, and I said, ‘Yeah, I’ll be over in a little bit.’ I pulled up there and there is Willy and Michael just in a pair of shorts playing baseball, throwing the ball back and forth to each other,” Carr said.\n“A lot of kids don’t do that anymore and that’s why I believe (Will has) elevated his game. You do all that stuff extra — you’re not on a baseball field, you’re not in a batting cage, you’re not on a mound, but you’re out in your yard and you’re just having fun. A lot of that turns over into eye-hand coordination.”\nAfter skipping football his junior year, Chye played QB and he was an All-West Michigan Conference Rivers Division first-team defensive back last fall.\nHe was also first-team All-WMC Rivers in basketball, another sport where Chye has enjoyed a good deal of success. In his senior season, Chye averaged 20 points, 8 rebounds and 2.8 assists. The four-year starter closed with 1,291 career points, ranking him fourth all-time at Mason County Central.\nTim Genson, Mason County Central’s longtime basketball coach and athletic director, said that Chye put in many hours during the offseason improving his game and he always did what was asked of him. Genson said that Chye guarded every position on the floor throughout his career.\nChye may come across more even-keel, but according to Genson there is a fire that burns inside.\n“Will is almost always a flat-line player, but every once in a while, his competitive juices come out and he can go from zero to 90 right now,” Genson said. “The first time I saw that happen it really surprised me because of how calm Will usually is.”\nOn the baseball field, Chye’s full skill set was on display during Mason County Central’s season-opening sweep at Shelby Tuesday.\nChye pitched and played shortstop in Game 1. He manned center field in Game 2. He went 3-for-6 at the plate from his cleanup spot with three runs scored, two RBIs and five stolen bases.\n“That’s not going to bother me that he’s not going to have a fifth year (of eligibility),” veteran Shelby coach Brian Wright quipped.\n“He’s a competitor. It doesn’t matter if he’s on the mound or playing out in the field — I mean, he just competes,” Wright said. “He runs the bases hard. He’s a good baseball player – he really is.”\nChye said that he’s heard from Muskegon Community College coaches about potentially playing basketball and/or baseball, but he has not made any final decisions yet. Muskegon Community College does offer a welding program, which is enticing to him.\nPat Chye has enjoyed a front-row seat during his son’s athletics career at Mason County Central as an assistant coach for basketball and baseball. Like many a parent, he realizes that it goes by in the blink of an eye.\n“It’s been a lot of fun. A lot of very proud moments as a parent and as a coach. I couldn’t be more proud of all the things he has accomplished and he has yet to accomplish,” said Pat Chye, who like his son stays very busy with parenting, coaching, farming and working for DTE Energy.\n“It’s one of those things where you don’t always appreciate it, but when you really step back and look, he’s just a good kid. He’s kind to all the people around him, good teammate. He really embraces the success of his teammates as well. Just an all-around good kid and a good teammate.”","length":7027,"publishedTime":"2023-04-16T16:00:00+00:00","rating":[8,7,7,6,8,8,7],"reason":[{"Accuracy":"The article provides detailed and factual information about Will Chye's athletic accomplishments and career path."},{"Objectivity":"The article maintains a balanced perspective, focusing on Will Chye's achievements without significant bias or personal opinions interfering with the presentation of facts."},{"Clarity and Coherence":"The structure and organization of the article are clear, making it easy to follow the timeline of Will Chye's sports career."},{"Depth of Analysis":"The article goes in-depth into Chye's performance in various sports, highlighting his skills and achievements."},{"Language and Presentation":"The language used is professional, and the overall presentation is well-written, with no apparent grammar or spelling issues."},{"Readability":"The article is easy to read and comprehend, with appropriate sentence structure and paragraph length."},{"Attractive":"The engaging writing style and vivid descriptions make the article captivating for readers, particularly sports enthusiasts."}],"conclusion":1},{"lang":"en-CA","siteName":"Yahoo Style","link":"https://ca.style.yahoo.com/golden-globes-winner-paul-giamatti-034928964.html","title":"“The Holdovers”' Paul Giamatti Ends Wry Golden Globes Best Actor Speech with Poignant Praise for Teachers","byline":"Jack Smart","excerpt":"Also nominated were Nicolas Cage, Timothée Chalamet, Matt Damon, Joaquin Phoenix and Jeffrey Wright","textContent":"The Daily BeastDisaster for Trump as Truth Social Crashes at Critical SOTU MomentMarco Bello/ReutersDonald Trump may have rage-posted his way through President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on Truth Social, but his social media site crashed for many before Biden even entered the House chamber, with technical issues lingering for at least an hour before and into his remarks.Beginning shortly before 9 p.m. EST Thursday, outages numbered in the thousands, according to Downdetector.

Then when the lockdown hit and we had an outbreak very early on and that’s it, it really hit home.”\nAs a nurse specialising in dementia care, at a care home in a small town near Glasgow, Mr Nicol had a front-row seat to some of the darkest sights of 2020, as residents fell ill with a then-largely unknown illness.\n“I remember thinking: ‘Oh my god, how are we going to deal with this?’,” Mr Nicol said.\nThere was a common understanding among staff that they would just have to make do until Covid-19 was better understood, he continued.\nOne particularly difficult memory for Mr Nicol was when a woman wanted to say goodbye to her father before his death, but he could only facilitate this through a phone call.\n“When the call ended, I just sat in there listening to him breathe,” he added.\n“That horrible, rattly Covid-chested breathing and coughing were the only noises in the room and I remember thinking, this is the hardest thing I’ve ever done as a nurse. Four years later, nothing’s come close to that.”\nMr Nicol described an almost omnipotence of Covid-19 in his life at that time: “We were living through it and then going home and seeing it all on the news.\n“That anxiety never, and can never, really go away for me. Even now, when Covid comes up, the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.”\nEven in rare moments of quiet in the care home, Mr Nicol said Covid-19 would not go away.\nHe recalled the atmosphere during breaks, when it was limited to two people in the room at once: “Normally […] you can chill out and you can decompress a little bit.\n“You’d just normally chat about like, what you did at the weekend. Those conversations were gone because you didn't do anything at the weekend, you just stayed in the house and watched the news.\n“Your break was either you were sitting in the room, chatting to [a colleague] about trying to help them through the experience, or you were both trying to call your family.”\nReflecting, Mr Nicol said that the first lockdown was probably “traumatic” for all those working in health and social care and still affected him now.\n“It’s not something that goes away very easily and there are times I pause and think about it, to consciously try and process and deal with it,” he said.\n“Covid just upended everything,” said Emily Gilhespy, an intensive care nurse at a hospital trust in the North West of England at the time of the outbreak.\n“The whole world, what you were used to, the environment in which you’re used to working, just completely changed when we had our first [Covid-19] patient.\n“That, for me, was probably the most poignant memory more than the lockdown. That moment marked a significant change in our work environment and how we were going to be functioning in our lives for the next year or so.”\nMs Gilhespy said that, before long, nurses were struggling despite a public perception of them as invincible and infallible superheroes.\nTo challenge this, she photographed nurses on the frontline of the pandemic.\nThe project hoped to capture the emotions and reality of the toll Covid-19 had on them.\n“A lot of media portrayals at the time about how nurses were operating on the frontlines of the pandemic felt a bit incongruous with the realities of it,” she said.\n“They didn’t touch on the human aspects of the fact these were individuals expected to go into work to face incredibly difficult and challenging environments.”\nLaura Fox, a senior intensive care sister when Covid-19 hit, was one of the nurses Ms Gilhespy captured in her project in full personal protective equipment (PPE) during the height of the pandemic.\nSpeaking to Nursing Times now, Ms Fox compared the pandemic with a storm.\nJust before cases ramped up in her hospital, she said there was an “eerie” calm in the large ward that had been cleared for the patients.\nWhat followed was so intense that she could scarcely remember any exact details.\n“It was a blur, it was all a blur,” she said. “It just happened […] and you think to yourself: ‘Did we really do that?’ It feels very surreal now. As though it never happened.”\nCaty Hollis was bedbound with Covid-19 when the first lockdown began but was back at work as a nurse at Marie Curie Hospice, Bradford, not long afterwards.\nShe noted that the hospice was “so short” on staff but the worst change was the fact that visitors were no longer allowed.\nShe said: “The distress that caused to everyone was the main difference, apart from the practicality of wearing all the PPE and everything that entailed.”\nThese issues, Ms Hollis noted, meant staff felt communicating with people at the end of their lives was less personal and harder.\n“The pandemic period was the hardest thing I’ve dealt with,” she said. “It’s not the nursing that was hard. It was the mental and emotional strain, it was the extra stuff.\n“We’re used to dealing with people dying. It was the lack of contact with their loved ones. It’s still with me now. I can’t say how terrible it was.”\n“Whilst I was hoping [lockdown] would give us a breather, I don’t think it actually did,” said Marlene Johnson, who was, in 2020, the head of nursing for renal, haematology, oncology and palliative care at St George’s University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in South London.\nShe added: “Our hospital was frantic, we were moving people around wards, around departments. We were extending [the intensive care unit].\n“Suddenly, we had to increase the capacity to be able to take our really sick patients.”\nMs Johnson said she was particularly worried about the potential of missed care for non-Covid-19 patients: “Our renal patients […] still needed that treatment, and we had to create a pathway for them so we could continue to dialyse them but also keep patients safe. We couldn’t turn them [away].”\nShe said patients with cancer, sickle cell and other long-term conditions were similarly impacted.\nAs a leader, Ms Johnson recalled having to juggle these concerns with firefighting in areas becoming overwhelmed. She was the bearer of bad news to some nurses, informing them they would be redeployed to areas outside of their specialty.\n“There were times I was asking nurses to do things that I knew they weren’t happy or comfortable with,” she said.\nShe recalled having to tell nurses in non-Covid-19 wards they would not be supplied with full-body PPE, against their requests.\nAt other times, she had to tell nurses inexperienced with intensive care that they would be redeployed to those areas.\n“I would come home sometimes feeling really quite burdened, quite burdened with information that I had to pass down,” said Ms Johnson.\nAs with other nurses in management positions, Ms Johnson said she tried to assist with lower level, hands-on clinical work where possible to alleviate her colleagues who were swamped and exhausted.\n\"There were times I was asking nurses to do things that I knew they weren’t happy or comfortable with\"\n“I had to get up to speed with lots of things,” she recalled.\nMs Johnson said that the atmosphere on the ward was tense, but that everybody supported each other where they could.\nFor her, personally, Ms Johnson said faith helped keep her going: “It wasn’t necessarily everyone’s thing, but I knew at times I went to an area of the hospital with other nurses who had the same faith, and I’d ask: ‘Should we pray together?’.\n“That was really well received by lots of staff […], to encourage and to strengthen each other.”\nShe added: “I remember being really touched once by a nurse who was from a completely different faith. He said: ‘Would you pray with me, Marlene?’\n“I did and I thought, that was the measure of his faith and his fear, that he was willing to reach out to someone else in a different faith to pray with him.”\nNicole Lee, a nurse at Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust at the time of the first lockdown, remembered being expected to do the impossible: training intensive care skills in redeployed nurses, which would normally take months or years, in a matter of days or weeks.\nMs Lee, whose normal role was burns clinical facilitator, also assisted in the set-up of the NHS Nightingale Hospital London at the ExCel centre.\nShe recalled being expected to do the impossible there, too: “The phrase ‘Can’t be done’ very quickly became ‘It can be done, what are we going to do about it?’.\nWhile the emergency period of Covid-19 has ended, Ms Lee noted ongoing pressures in the NHS and was also concerned about rising levels of abuse against nurses.\nJess Sainsbury, an adult and mental health nursing student at the University of Southampton at the time of the first lockdown, said she burst into tears when she heard that her cohort would be drafted in to help on the frontline.\nShe said the fear of the unknown – of what they were going into, about their registration – was what shocked her and others in the same position.\nAs then-chair of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) students committee, Ms Sainsbury campaigned to ensure deployed students had some degree of say over where they went and what work they would be doing.\nShe, personally, was deployed into a mental health crisis team in Southampton.\n“For a while, we felt we were anticipating what they called at the time the ‘second wave’ of Covid – the mental health wave where services would be overwhelmed in a few months’ time,” Ms Sainsbury said, recalling what work was like at the time.\nShe said that, amid the challenges, some positive changes to practice and working conditions happened out of necessity and stuck afterwards.\nAlong with NHS England and the Florence Nightingale Foundation (FNF), Ms Sainsbury helped push for wider access to clinical supervision for nursing staff in her RCN role.\n“We had been talking about clinical supervision for 30 years in nursing, so that was definitely a positive,” said Ms Sainsbury, who now works for FNF.\n“Student advocacy and representation kind of happened in silos before […], but what we had to do was reach the masses of the student body, so we all had to work together,\" she said.\n“It kind of brought those groups together. It also made [senior national nursing figures] listen to what the students were saying, that was a big positive.”\nFormer critical care matron Lucy Jenkins recalled her entire department at Homerton Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, East London, cheering when a consultant announced that a lockdown was about to start.\nLike many nurses across the country, however, she quickly noticed that lockdown was not an instant saving grace.\n“We didn’t see the effects straight away and we were still getting overwhelmed,” she said.\n“It was horrific and it ramped up in such a short moment of time. It was particularly frightening because, though wave one was shorter in length, there was the sheer unknown.\n“Our [infection] numbers went from a couple to our wards being at full and quadruple capacity. People were dying, our colleagues were coming in sick.\nMs Jenkins said she was “convinced” she was going to catch the disease and that it would kill her, and that her husband – a paramedic – shared the same fear.\nThat, combined with having no idea when it would all end, stuck with her throughout the emergency period.\nShe recalled something of a “Blitz spirit” between colleagues at the time.\n“I don’t like this phrase, but it’s a good way to explain it,\" she said.\n\"I’d walk through the staff room and see these junior nurses looking absolutely shell-shocked. But there was this overwhelming sense of duty\"\n“People would fall down emotionally, but others took it in turns […] to pick someone up.”\nShe recalled a “shell-shocked” look on her more junior colleagues’ faces at times during the emergency period.\n“I’d walk through the staff room and see these junior nurses looking absolutely shell-shocked. But there was this overwhelming sense of duty and we needed to just do what we needed to do.”\nHowever, she said there were “pockets of positivity” that came out of that time.\nShe remembered a junior nurse arriving to work upset about not finding basic groceries in the supermarket – but people began to drop items off for free in response.\nMs Jenkins said moments like that had a special place in her memory.\nShe added that the resilience shown by the health workforce and increased recognition for her speciality was a positive. “It put critical care on the map a bit,” she noted.","length":13938,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T06:00:34+00:00","rating":[8,8,7,6,7,7,8],"reason":["The article showcases nurses reflecting on the lasting impact of Covid-19 four years after the first lockdown, providing personal insights into the challenges faced during the pandemic.

An ivory tower English professor casts his learned eye at the lyrics of Michael Jackson and Rick Astley, and cares not for their tawdry and unsettling implications.","textContent":"Tom Zoellner is a tenured Professor of English at Chapman University, the author of numerous distinguished works of non-fiction, and an editor-at-large of the Los Angeles Review of Books. Professor Zoellner has graciously consented to briefly withdraw his critical gaze from high art and cast an eye for SPIN at classic pop and rock lyrics.\nIt’s time for an inquiry into questionable lyrics of the ‘80s. First we shall examine Michael Jackson’s mega-smash “Billie Jean,” in which he offers a Biblically-tinged lament that the presumptive mother of his child is being uncharitable to him.\nFor forty days and for forty nightsThe law was on her side\nAccording to California Family Code section Chapter 12, section 7662, a suspected father given “written notice alleging that he is or could be the natural father of the child” has THIRTY days to give a response.\nThe law says nothing about “nights” nor does it allow for a ten-day extension, but never mind. The more important legal error here is Jackson’s fundamental misunderstanding of civil procedure. At the time of the mother’s declaration, he is presumed blameless in the absence of evidence so, in a real sense, the law was on his side in that window.\nAnother problem: the Thriller album was released in 1982, a full six years before the advent of DNA blood-typing used to prove paternity. So his repeated profusions of innocence—”the kid is not my son!”—may have been enough to get him off whatever hook he perceives, even if he has his secret doubts because the child seems to be a physical resemblance to him.\nPerhaps this is why he repeatedly informs us, with emphasis, that the dance they shared was “on the floor” and “in the round.” While the unprotected intimacy and possible conception surely happened in the privacy of her room after he got one whiff of the sweet perfume she wore, the public nature of the dance he frets about seems to point to a fear of witnesses that could be subpoenaed.\nHowever, merely being witnessed dancing with the complainant does not cross the bar of evidence necessary to prove paternity. The ignorance of the judicial system he’s already displayed by thinking the court tallies “nights” in the response time to a petition is only confirmed.\nAnd all this drama is about nothing more than child support, no? The court sets in on a scale according to income—it won’t break your bank.\n“You wouldn’t get this from any other guy.” Rick Astley puts his mark upon a woman’s garments in Perth, Scotland, 2013. (Credit: Scott Campbell/Redferns via Getty Images)\nNow let’s look at a questionable 1987 pop lyric, this one from the notorious “Never Gonna Give You Up,” by Rick Astley, a song beloved by internet pranksters. But it reveals another more insidious joke to a careful listener.\nThe premise of Astley’s message to a woman friend (“we’ve known each other for so long”) is that he knows she’s been pining for him, and he is prepared to offer her an unequivocal lifetime commitment on the spot. He promises to be faithful and stay in the relationship no matter what happens.\nBear in mind that this is all before they have even kissed, a level of uninformed decision-making that, by comparison, makes an arranged marriage in Amish country look positively pornographic.\nThat’s not even the most hair-raising part of this proposition. He then assures her: “You wouldn’t get this from any other guy.”\nWhoa there, cowboy. You’re saying that no other man would be faithful to her – that she must either accept lifetime betrothal to Rick Astley or face years of disappointment and betrayal from various cads?\nWe want to think the best of him because he seems so earnest. But it doesn’t add up. He is displaying a prime gaslighting technique, verbally devaluing her stock on the market and telling her she’s lucky he’s there to provide a once-in-a-lifetime deal. “Only I can fix it.”\nOur inescapable conclusion is that the target of this pitch is being snowed by an acquaintance hoping to climb out of the friend zone for a bout of hanky-panky before moving on.\nAnd that, my friends, may be the real definition of a Rickroll.","length":4136,"publishedTime":"2024-02-21T00:04:29+00:00","rating":[7,8,6,7,7,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the lyrics of songs by Michael Jackson and Rick Astley, examining them from a legal and social perspective.

The Jester was left furious at himself for missing a black on 42, and the Northern Irishman duly nipped in to scored 52, eventually putting the frame to bed after a long battle on the blue.That set up a dramatic decider, which was full of errors and tension, as both players got their hand on the table, but failed to compile a winning break.‘You can put that back if you want’ – Allen cracks joke after refereeing mistakeSelby did look set for victory when making a 45, only for his opponent to back, helped by a couple of fouls and a huge fluke on the green.The final moments of the match were extraordinary, as the black was pushed over the right corner pocket, with Allen at one point snookered behind it.'Quite incredible' - John Higgins nearly makes 167 despite spectators walking around during breakWorld Championship preview: Can Luca Brecel break 'infamous curse' at the Crucible?Riyadh Season World Masters: Ding Junhui sets up clash with Ali Carter after whitewash winHe was forced to play an amazing shot on the pink, going in and out of baulk to pot it, before playing a quite sensational double on the black to claim victory and book his place in the semi-finals.\"I was actually trying to go off the side cushion, hit the pink and then I would develop the black,\" he confessed afterwards. \"I knew if I hit it full ball, I was going to land in trouble. I actually thought the white was going to drop in! It was such an easy shot to flick off the black, but I thought ‘no, I’m going for it.’ As long as I got a really good white, I’d be alright!\"It was such an easy safety, but you know what Mark’s like, he makes you work for everything. I could have been waiting a while for another chance, so I thought I’d go for it.\"I’ve come here to win. That’s what it’s all about. Every player who’s come here this week would have fancied their chances to win. \"I’m still here. There’ll only be four people left by the time I play again. I’ve got as good a chance as anyone.\"Selby in the end could only smile after coming out on the wrong side of lady luck, but this is another disappointing defeat in a season in which he is yet to win a tournament.Although this is only an invitational event, victory would have stood him in good stead ahead of another tilt at the World Championship.\"That last frame,\" he exclaimed. \"Oh my God! He’s come off the jaw and snookered me behind the yellow, I’ve gone through the gap of the two reds and left a free ball, and then even at the end there, what happened, it was just one of those games! \"It was mental, but nothing surprises you in this game! But it sort of punishes you when you don’t take your chances. I had my chances to win 4-1, I had a chance to win 4-2. When you don’t, things like that happen. The game just doesn’t forgive you!\"Brecel finds form to beat CarterWhile that match took over four hours to conclude, the one that followed took half as long, as world champion Luca Brecel beat Ali Carter 4-1.The pair shared the opening four frames, with the Pilot benefiting from his opponent going in-off in the second, showing excellent fluency in a visit of 67 following a somewhat nervy opener.Brecel responded with an even better 72 to regain the lead, with his potting particularly impressive, and he appeared to be racing to a 3-1 lead when on 63 in the fourth, only to miss a red to the right corner.That was a huge relief to Carter, who had only had one shot in the frame to that point, while his opponent only needed a red and a colour to make it snookers required.The two-time Crucible runner-up looked set for a brilliant steal, but missed the brown off its spot on 49, meaning the Belgian could add the brown and blue to finally open up a two frame advantage.The fifth frame was similar to the first, with both players getting their hand on the table, only to spurn chances to putting together a significant visit.Brecel in particular struggled with his cue ball control, but eventually got over the winning line, although he needed help from Carter, who missed a red to the right middle and saw a hit-and-hope after being snookered behind the blue go wrong.\"I was a bit nervous today to be honest,\" he admitted. \"It doesn’t really happen that often, but today I felt it a little bit at the beginning. \"I was just trying to get into the game and I managed to do that. I settled quite quickly. It’s a new location. It’s always difficult to settle down, so I’m just really happy to still be in the tournament.\"I was just trying to get used to the table. It was quite difficult at the beginning, but I had some momentum at 2-1 up. Then I missed and easy red and it sort of changed, but I managed to win, so I’m very, very happy.\"While defending World Champion will now play Mark Allen in the semis, Carter heads for an early exit, but he was not happy with a couple of events that were out of his hands, including having to wait so long to get on the table.\"I got here and for four hours I’m sitting in a room waiting to play,\" he said. \"You come a long way and you have to deal with that. It’s a great event and it’s very raw at the minute. \"It’s such a big opportunity for someone to win a such a great event. For everything to go wrong today, right from the off, is very, very frustrating.\"The Pilot was also unhappy with a scoreboard malfunction, which he says was the reason for the missed brown in frame four.He added: \"I’m clearing up, I want to get on with it, and the scorer’s got the score wrong. I’ve stunned up the table, thinking I can play anything I want, I’ve looked at the scoreboard, now all of a sudden I’m thinking ‘have I miscalculated?’\"It’s just completely put me out of my rhythm. I thought I had to pot the brown to be able to draw. I don’t know how it worked out, but as I’m looking at the blue, all of a sudden, the referee has gone ‘you’re on 41’, so I think I was 22 behind. \"It just completely threw me.

Find out more about how we test.\nEven though we’ve been reviewing Neat Acoustic speakers for decades, we’re still impressed by just how infectiously entertaining the brand’s speakers typically are.The Neat Petite Classic speakers we have on test here are the fifth generation of the Petite model, which originally began production in the early 1990s, and have remained not just one of the most well-liked but also the biggest-selling speakers in Neat’s entire catalogue.Build & design(Image credit: What Hi-Fi?)The Petite Classic sticks with the same dimensions as the original, measuring a very, ahem, petite 30 x 20 x 18cm (hwd). These would be ideal for when you want a premium hi-fi set-up but don’t have a large space – their compact footprint means they should be easy to accommodate in most rooms that aren’t cavern-like halls.The last time we reviewed a Petite speaker was the fourth-generation Petite SX in 2010 and, apart from the size of the cabinets, pretty much every other aspect has been changed. Neat revived the Petite model for its 30th anniversary in 2021, and it's the upgrades made to this limited edition model that have made their way to the current Petite Classic speakers. They remain a two-way design, with a new AMT ribbon tweeter that claims to deliver better high-frequency performance and a 15cm mid/bass driver with a cone made of mineral-loaded polypropylene. Neat says that despite being a smaller diameter than the original (which was 16.8cm), this mid/bass unit should produce deeper bass thanks to a more powerful motor. Neat Petite Classic tech specs(Image credit: What Hi-Fi?)Type StandmountersDrive units AMT ribbon tweeter, 15cm mid/bass conePorted? Yes (rear)Bi-wire? NoImpedance 6 ohmsSensitivity 87dBDimensions (hwd) 30 x 20 x 18cmWeight 7kgFinishes x 4 (textured black, satin white, oak and walnut)Internally, there is a new crossover network with updated, high-quality components, and you only get single-wire terminals now instead of the bi-wire terminals of previous generations. The cabinet is well-made, and although there’s nothing particularly luxurious to shout about, we like that there are no visible fixings or bolts around the drivers, leaving a minimalist, clean fascia. It perhaps doesn’t exude the perceived value you’d expect from a premium pair of standmounters, but we have no complaints whatsoever about the fit and finish of the Petite Classic. Passing our hand over the cabinet surface, we like the quality of the wood grain finish of our oak review sample.These Neat speakers are available in four finishes: textured black, satin white, oak and walnut. You do pay a £305 premium for the wood finishes, though. At this new £1995-£2300 price range, the Petite Classic have formidable rivals to contend with, such as the larger KEF R3 Meta (£1999), the long-running ATC SCM 19 (£2400) and the pricier ProAc Response D2R (£3000).Compatibility(Image credit: What Hi-Fi?)It may be tempting to put these small speakers anywhere, but take some time and care with positioning and you’ll be richly rewarded.We experimented with a few positions in our listening room, and found the speakers sounded best when placed on dedicated speaker stands (a must), set roughly 30cm from the back wall, and toed in slightly to our listening position to get the best stereo imaging. Neat also includes two staggered bass ports at the rear of the speaker. These are of different sizes and tuned to different frequencies, so you can adjust the amount of bass on offer to the size of your room. The recommendation in most cases is to plug the larger port with the included foam bung and keep the smaller port free. We find this combination works well in our listening room – it helps to keep the bass more controlled and reined in; otherwise the amount of bass is just a bit too prominent and a touch boomy. We would recommend trying out a few combinations of port-blocking and positioning for yourself to find a balance that you’re happy with.For our review, we plug the Neat Petite Classic into our reference set-up of the PMC Cor integrated amplifier and Naim Uniti Atom Headphone Edition music streamer. We also pair the speakers with the Naim Nait XS 3 (£2499) as a more price-appropriate partner. This Neat/Naim partnership is one we’ve recommended before, and we’re glad to find it still works a treat.Sound(Image credit: What Hi-Fi?)We could, quite honestly, quote portions of our Petite reviews from 1992, 1993 and 2010, and the words would apply just the same to the current model. Terrific rhythmic ability, wide and rock-solid soundstage, great interplay between vocals and instruments – these are traits of the Petite model that have remained consistent throughout the decades. We applaud any brand that has managed to keep its sonic identity consistent throughout its existence, and the pure musical joy that these mini monitors deliver is worth the expense. These speakers are just fun. Toe-tappingly, grin-inducing fun. Their rhythmic ability is stunning – it’s infectious, agile, precise and zippy. There is a sure-footed handling of every beat and note in a song that is endlessly enjoyable to listen to. That precision with timing means the speakers are a dab hand with any genre you play through them: we play The Beatles, Dr Dre, Major Lazer, Massive Attack, Agnes Obel, John Williams, Led Zeppelin, Elliott Smith, and many more from our test track collection – and the Petite communicate the inherent musical composition and message of most songs with ease. That’s a difficult quality for any speaker to manage successfully, and it’s even more impressive coming from these small boxes. The Petite Classic do have a slightly smoothed-off treble that makes listening a tad “nicer”, and coupled with fairly low distortion levels, it means we don’t have any problem cranking up the volume and getting fatigued with any brightness over time. They’re just as tuneful and hold our interest when the volume levels are low, too. We’re not expecting lashings of bone-thudding bass here, but the low end on offer is tuneful and grippy. It underpins and drives the beat to Massive Attack’s Paradise Circus, while Pon De Floor by Major Lazer has punch, attack and zeal. This is further emphasised by a sound that is extremely solid – there’s a beautifully grounded quality to every note that’s rather astonishing for speakers of this size. (Image credit: What Hi-Fi?)There’s ample detail here too, with a particularly lovely way with voices. The delicate folk qualities of The Unthanks are relayed with a lightness of touch while Eminem’s intense, aggressive rapping has the requisite crackling spitting rage. The speakers aren’t the last word in refinement and analysis – these are for those that simply want to enjoy the music rather than inspect every element with fervour.That being said, the Neat speakers are considered enough to know when to rein in that liveliness and deliver the more contemplative and meditative moods of, for instance, the Theme For Schindler’s List or a sombre Nick Cave track well.Give the speakers a few days of running in, and you’ll find they breathe more freely. They pump out quite a decent spread and volume from their compact dimensions, and the stereo imaging you get is top-notch when positioned with care. They don't sound as large-scaled as the bigger KEF R3 Meta speakers, granted, though it’s only really obvious when playing more complex and grand orchestral pieces. If absolute tonal neutrality and transparency are your priorities then you’ll want the ATC SCM 19 speakers at this level, while those wanting subtler insight and greater dynamic contrast should look toward the ProAc Response D2R. Again, it’s that knack for spot-on timing and cohesion that is the Neats’ crowning glory – these are eminently likeable and fun speakers that put enjoyment above all else. Verdict(Image credit: What Hi-Fi?)If it isn’t clear by now, these Neat speakers are delightfully good fun. They do have a specific balance and a specific purpose, and if you go in knowing full well the restrictions of these “Petite” boxes, then you’ll have a grand time. They may look unassuming and the fairly high price tag will raise eyebrows, but pair them with high-quality tracks and a good partnering amp, and their inherent musicality will keep you entertained for many, many years.SCORESSound 5Build 5Compatibility 4MORE:Read our review of the KEF R3 MetaAlso consider the ATC SCM 19Read our ProAc Response D2R reviewBest speakers: budget to premium hi-fi speakers tested by our expert reviewers\nWhat Hi-Fi?, founded in 1976, is the world's leading independent guide to buying and owning hi-fi and home entertainment products.

Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now. “The act and conduct of the convict are highly deplorable. The convict beat up the complainant/victim regularly during her stay in her matrimonial home, subjected her to cruelty and also threatened her. The daughter of the victim also supported the case of prosecution and clearly submitted that she observed since her childhood that her father habitually beat up her mother and maltreated her,” ruled the court while pronouncing the quantum of sentence on February 27. Repeatedly set gas cylinder on fire: Complaint Approaching the police on March 15, 2021, the complainant had submitted that she married the accused in December 1997. She alleged that her husband was habitual of fighting, and thrashing her and their children over frivolous things. She had also filed a complaint in September 2012, but the matter ended in compromise after her husband’s assurance. However, nothing changed. Detailing his onslaughts, she alleged that her husband was habitual of turning on the knob of the gas cylinder, putting the pipe of the gas cylinder under the door and setting it on fire in a state of intoxication. She said the accused would ignite the fire with the help of cockroach spray and sanitiser, etc. Both their children were studying MBBS in China and returned to India during the Covid-19 pandemic, she said. Back then, in May 2020, he assaulted their daughter in an inebriated state, causing eye injury. The accused later in the night also set the gas cylinder on fire. The complainant and her children managed to save their lives and spent the night in their car. To ensure their safety, in June 2020, she shifted to her parental house at Rohtak amid the pandemic. She further alleged that the accused also threatened her and their children through SMS and WhatsApp. Convict pleaded leniency Pleading the court for a lenient view, the convict said he was a government employee and will lose his job if he was ordered to undergo imprisonment. Further, he had no source of income except the salary and no other case was pending against him. However, the public prosecutor opposed his plea, saying the convict should be sentenced to maximum punishment, as he had beaten up the complainant regularly in a state of intoxication during her stay at matrimonial home and also threatened to kill her, her brother and her nephew. The convict further submitted that he was a caring father who also used the money deposited in his GPF account to fund the overseas education of his children. However, the court observed, “Merely because the accused used the resources available with him to fund the education of his children does not imply that he did not commit cruelty with the complainant. All parents utilise their resources to the best of their capabilities for the welfare of their children and the same cannot be used as a shield to protect the accused from the consequences of his conduct spanning over several years.” Sentencing him to three-year jail, the court held that this was not a fit case to release the him on probation as he was habitual of beating up the complainant, subjecting her to cruelty and threatening her. But the court granted him bail against bail bonds of ₹30,000 with one surety, while also allowing him time till March 27, 2024, to file appeal.

A year ago, the average 30-year fixed-rate was 6.73%.\n “Evidence that purchase demand remains sensitive to interest rate changes was on display this week, as applications rose for the first time in six weeks in response to lower rates,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement.\n Thursday’s decline caps a four-week streak of rising rates and will likely draw even more people to the spring market.\n Applications for mortgages were up 9.7% in the week ending March 1 from the week before, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.\n Applications for a loan to purchase a home were up 11% from a week earlier, while refinance applications rose 8% from a week earlier, on a seasonally adjusted basis — although both were below levels reached a year ago.\n Also, applications for Federal Housing Administration loans were up last week, demonstrating an interest from first-time homebuyers, according to the MBA report.\n Still, with homebuyers struggling in one of the least affordable markets in decades, mortgage rates are one of the biggest — and most persistent — hurdles for potential homebuyers, he said, in addition to stubbornly low inventory.\n “It’s important to remember that rates can vary widely between mortgage lenders, so shopping around is essential,” Khater added.\n More homes are coming to market, as is typical during the spring homebuying and selling season.\n New listings of homes for sale rose 13% year over year during the four weeks ending February 25, marking the biggest increase in nearly three years, according to Redfin.\n Total inventory is also improving. While active listings are flat from a year ago, February’s report from Redfin was notable because it marked the first time in nine months the total number of homes for sale hadn’t declined.\n On the buyers’ side, the increase in mortgage applications without much of a decrease in mortgage rates suggests that people looking for a home are currently more concerned about having more homes to choose from than they are about the financing costs.\n On the sellers’ side, the increase in new listings suggests that at least some homeowners can no longer wait for mortgage rates to fall in order to sell their home and become buyers themselves.\n New listings are up in 70% of the country’s metro areas, according to Bright MLS.\n “Conventional wisdom was that mortgage rates had to come down significantly in order to entice homeowners to sell,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS, in a statement. “However, like with so much about the current housing market, conventional wisdom has not been exactly on target.”\n Sturtevant said many current home sales are being driven by people’s individual life changes like a marriage or a divorce, a new baby, or a need to be closer to aging parents.\n “People may have been putting off moving, hoping they would be able to sell when interest rates were lower, but those life circumstances have begun to outweigh the financial considerations for some,” she said.\n While mortgage rates are expected to fall further in 2024, Sturtevant added, short-term movements in mortgage rates will likely be influenced by congressional testimony given this week by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. During his semiannual monetary report to Congress, he indicated there is no rush to cut interest rates with more evidence of cooling inflation. The February jobs report, which will be released Friday, is also likely to have some bearing on mortgage rates. If the job numbers are quite strong, it will suggest that the economy is still growing at a healthy pace. That means the Fed is likely to push out its timeline for rate cuts.","length":4511,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T17:00:48.258Z","rating":[5,7,7,6,8,6,6],"reason":[{"Accuracy":"The article provides accurate data on mortgage rates and applications, supported by data from reliable sources like Freddie Mac and the Mortgage Bankers Association."},{"Objectivity":"The article presents a balanced perspective on the housing market, showcasing both buyer and seller viewpoints without explicit bias."},{"Clarity and Coherence":"The article is well-organized, making it easy to follow the information presented."},{"Depth of Analysis":"While the article offers insights into mortgage rates and housing market trends, it lacks in-depth analysis or further examination of potential implications."},{"Language and Presentation":"The language used is clear, and the overall presentation is coherent, with minimal errors in spelling and grammar."},{"Readability":"The text is readable, with a mixture of short and long paragraphs aiding in comprehension."},{"Attractive":"The writing style is informative but lacks elements to make it particularly engaging or captivating."}],"conclusion":1},{"lang":"en","siteName":null,"link":"https://www.who.int/news/item/05-03-2024-wave-of-new-commitments-marks-historic-step-towards-the-elimination-of-cervical-cancer","title":"Wave of new commitments marks historic step towards the elimination of cervical cancer","byline":"WHO Media Team\n\nWorld Health Organization \n\nEmail:\n[email protected]","excerpt":"Governments, donors, multilateral institutions, and partners today announced major new policy, programmatic and financial commitments, including nearly US$ 600 million in new funding, to eliminate cervical cancer. If these ambitions to expand vaccine coverage and strengthen screening and treatment programs are fully realized, the world could eliminate a cancer for the first time.","textContent":"Governments, donors, multilateral institutions, and partners today announced major new policy, programmatic and financial commitments, including nearly US$ 600 million in new funding, to eliminate cervical cancer. If these ambitions to expand vaccine coverage and strengthen screening and treatment programs are fully realized, the world could eliminate a cancer for the first time.These commitments were made at the first-ever Global Cervical Cancer Elimination Forum: Advancing the Call to Action in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, to catalyse national and global momentum to end this preventable disease. Every two minutes, a woman dies from cervical cancer, although the knowledge and the tools to prevent and even eliminate this disease already exist. Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) – the leading cause of cervical cancer – can prevent the vast majority of cases and, combined with screening and treatment, provides a path to elimination. Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, and continues to disproportionately impact women and their families in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). In an important shift, the World Health Organization (WHO)’s 2022 global recommendation for one-dose HPV vaccine schedules significantly reduced barriers to scaling up vaccination programs. It was reinforced by a similar recommendation in the Americas Region in 2023. The WHO’s Regional Office for Africa has just followed suit with its own recommendation for countries in the region to adopt the single-dose vaccination schedule. To date, 37 countries have reported switching or intent to switch to a one-dose regimen. The commitments announced at the forum mark a watershed moment to accelerate progress on a promise made in 2020, when 194 countries adopted WHO’s global strategy to eliminate cervical cancer. “We have the knowledge and the tools to make cervical cancer history, but vaccination, screening and treatment programmes are still not reaching the scale required,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “This first global forum is an important opportunity for governments and partners to invest in the global elimination strategy and addressing the inequities that deny women and girls access to the life-saving tools they need.” In addition to a re-commitment by Indonesia to its National Action Plan 2023, other country  commitments include:Democratic Republic of Congo commits to start introducing the HPV vaccine as early as possible using the WHO-recommended single-dose schedule. We also commit to do everything to get, as early as possible, to the cervical cancer elimination strategy immunization’s coverage target for girls aged 9 to 14 years. Ethiopia commits to implement a robust vaccine delivery strategy across the country, targeting at least 95% coverage in 2024 for all 14-year-old girls, regardless of their socioeconomic status, whether in school or out of school. The country also commits to screen 1 million eligible women every year for cervical cancer and to treat 90% of those screened, who present with positive precancerous lesions. Further, HPV single dose has been approved to be introduced this year and scaled up as part of the country’s Expanded Program on Immunization plans.Nigeria launched its HPV vaccine national program this year, adopting  the single-dose schedule for girls 9 to 14 years old, and now commits to achieving at least 80% vaccine coverage of girls. They are committed to continuing to increase coverage of the HPV vaccine through a robust delivery strategy that will meet the girls where they are. For girls who are in school, they will concentrate on school-based delivery; for girls that are not in school, they will commit to implementing outreach activities at key moments in the year, with the target of at least 80% coverage of girls targeted by 2026. The nearly US$ 600 million in new funding includes US$ 180 million from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, US$ 10 million from UNICEF, and US$ 400 million from the World Bank. A full list and description of commitments can be found here and will be updated throughout the forum. There are many challenges on the path to elimination. Due to supply constraints, delivery challenges and the COVID-19 pandemic, just one in five eligible adolescent girls were vaccinated in 2022. And while there are cost-effective and evidence-based tools for screening and treatment, fewer than 5% of women in many LMICs are ever screened for cervical cancer. Health system constraints, costs, logistical issues, and lack of political will have created obstacles to implementing comprehensive programs for cervical cancer prevention and treatment. These barriers have led to deep inequity: of the estimated 348 000 cervical cancer deaths in 2022, over 90% took place in LMICs. With governments and partners recommitting urgently to the global agenda, it is possible to reverse the tide and prevent annual deaths from rising to 410 000 by 2030, as currently estimated. Quote from Government of Colombia:“For the Government of Colombia, in its commitment to guaranteeing the rights of women in their diversities, it is imperative to advance in the elimination of cervical cancer; a disease that affects millions of girls and women. Therefore, we are pleased to host the first Global Forum for the Elimination of Cervical Cancer; This is an opportunity that will allow the country, and the world, to exchange experiences and knowledge that will contribute to eliminating barriers to care, increasing vaccination against HPV and facilitating capacity development so that countries and partners continue adding actions for elimination of cervical cancer.”For the Spanish government, \"Cervical cancer is a public health problem for which there are already prevention, detection, and treatment tools,\" as stated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Union, and Cooperation, José Manuel Albares, who is convinced that \"with political will, we can address it. We are confident that, from this first forum, commitments and support will emerge from countries, international organizations, global initiatives, philanthropic entities, and civil society to boost government action and commitment to achieving the goals of the WHO strategy. In coherence with its feminist foreign and cooperation policy, Spain is ready to undertake significant commitments to achieve this.\"This milestone forum is co-sponsored by the Governments of Colombia and Spain in partnership with the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO); World Health Organization (WHO); UNICEF; the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation; Unitaid; the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF); Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the United States Agency for International Development (USAID); and the World Bank. Co-host QuotesDr Chris Elias, President, Global Development, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation:“HPV vaccines are a miracle of modern medicine, yet too many girls in low- and middle-income countries do not have access to them. There is no reason why women should die from cervical cancer when a vaccine to prevent it exists. With the addition of WHO’s guidance for a one-dose HPV vaccine schedule, cervical cancer elimination is within reach. Now is the time for governments and partners around the world to increase HPV vaccine access and protect future generations from cervical cancer.” Aurélia Nguyen, Chief Programme Officer, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance:“The HPV vaccine is one of the most impactful vaccines on the planet and has already helped save thousands of lives. More girls urgently deserve the same protection, which is why in partnership with countries, Gavi has set an ambitious goal to help vaccinate 86 million adolescent girls by 2025. With bold commitment and decisive action, we can look forward to a future where cervical cancer has been eliminated for good.”Juan Pablo Uribe, Director of the Global Financing Facility for Women, Children and Adolescents (GFF) and Global Director for Health Nutrition and Population at the World Bank“The World Bank and the GFF are doubling down efforts for cervical cancer elimination, with at least US$400 million for HPV-related investments over the next three years. Every woman and every girl should have access to cervical cancer prevention, screening and treatment as part of regular health care services. Much more work is ahead of all of us with a shared goal: eliminate cervical cancer. We need to build on today’s momentum and support countries‘ leadership to accelerate progress.”Dr Jarbas Barbosa, Director, Pan American Health Organization:“We have the urgent need to scale up access and coverage for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, screening and treatment.  I express PAHO’s profound commitment to elevate the political will and prioritize cervical cancer elimination in the public health agenda of countries in the Americas.  “This is part of PAHO’s Disease Elimination Initiative, which aims to eliminate as many as 30 communicable diseases and related conditions, including cervical cancer, in the Americas by 2030. Through PAHO’s Regional Revolving Funds, high quality HPV vaccines, HPV diagnostic tests and ablative pre-cancer treatment devices are available at one price for all our Member States regardless of purchase size.”Helga Fogstad, Director of Health, UNICEF:For the first time, the end of an entire category of cancer is in sight. With the necessary tools at our disposal, commitment and political will are the next critical steps to a future free of cervical cancer for generations to come. UNICEF is dedicated to the shared global target of protecting the lives of 86 million girls by next year and pledges US $10 million to support 21 countries in vaccinating girls against HPV, in addition to our existing commitments to this important and urgent cause. The impact of these new funds will be amplified as a result of UNICEF’s multi-sectoral approach making the most of our school and community platforms and partnerships with girls’ and women’s rights organizations to ensure success in demand generation.”Marisol Touraine, Executive Board Chair, Unitaid:“We cannot accept that women die from cervical cancer, when we know how to prevent and treat this disease.  At this pivotal moment, we must ensure the efficient tools we have are both affordable and available to every woman and girl in need. Our projects at Unitaid have dramatically reduced the cost of HPV screening and the price of lifesaving thermal ablation devices. We are launching another wave of investments that will focus on bringing cervical cancer screening outside of healthcare facilities and into communities. Together with our partners, we will continue to lay the groundwork for a future where all women have equitable access to the care they deserve, regardless of their socio-economic status or geographic location.\"Dr Atul Gawande, Assistant Administrator for Global Health, United States Agency for International Development:“With the powerful shield of the HPV vaccine, regular screening, and early treatment, we can safeguard a generation from the devastating effects of cervical cancer. Every shot is a bold stride towards a future where cervical cancer is eliminated. USAID remains a steadfast partner to governments, communities, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, for ensuring access to this life-saving intervention. Through PEPFAR’s Go Further partnership, USAID will also combat cervical cancer by extending screening and treatment options to the most vulnerable communities where people are at higher risk for acquiring HIV and HPV.

So when I spotted the most supernatural glitter lip gloss I had ever seen in my life on model Alina Timo’s TikTok, I had the intense urge to get my hands on it immediately. A quick scroll through the comments revealed the identity of the lip product, which a number of equally enthusiastic commenters figured out to be Isamaya’s Liplacq 2.0 Maximizing Lip Serum in the Shade Chrome.Once I tried it, I couldn’t stop. For months, I’ve been using it everywhere: on my eyelids for subtle shimmer, four coats of it on my lips for an Instagram sparkle-filter finish, and even a small dab as highlighter on the tops of my cheekbones when I’m feeling adventurous.Wearing Isamaya Liplacq on my cheekbones and eyelidsThe Liplacq became a core part of my revolving makeup routine in ways I never expected, but the $38 price tag is a bit prohibitive for me to continue to live my best, sparkliest life. Then, my friend lent me her Milani Highly Rated Diamond Shimmer Gloss, which costs nearly $30 less but seemed to be a viable dupe. After a few rounds of testing, I’ve weighed in on both below.The SimilaritiesBoth the Isamaya and Milani products are vegan glosses consisting of metallic silver glitter suspended in a clear base. They layer the same with multiple coats for a buildable effect. I’ve found, from a distance or in still photos, they look like regular high-shine glosses, but once you come closer (or stand in the way of direct or iPhone-camera light), that’s when the shimmer really announces itself. Both glosses wear for about two to three hours or until you eat anything before you need to reapply.The DifferencesAside from the major price gap, the main difference between these two sparkly glosses is that Isamaya’s contains lip-plumping ingredients like hyaluronic-acid microspheres and ginger oil (it’s labeled a “serum”), while Milani’s formula focuses primarily on the look. (Moisturizing vitamin E and high-shine polymers are its star ingredients.) While I barely noticed or felt any plumping action from the Liplacq, I did find that it contains more potent silver pigment in a single swipe — meaning it only takes two or three layers to achieve my ideal shimmer factor compared to Milani’s four or five. But the extra applications don’t take much effort, especially because the Milani gloss feels like a silky lip oil or balm, while Liplacq feels slightly heavier (but not sticky).Wearing Milani Diamond Shimmer Gloss on my lipsWearing Isamaya Liplacq on my lipsThe VerdictI’ll forever credit Isamaya’s Chrome Liplacq for getting me into high-sparkle gloss, but the impact of Milani’s dupe makes it hard to consider paying almost $40 for a single tube.

The rapid development of narrow-bandgap formamidinium lead triiodide-based perovskites has brought perovskite single-junction solar cell efficiencies up to 26.1%. However, such compositional engineering route has reached the limit of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a resonant perovskite solar cell that produces giant light absorption at the perovskite band edge with tiny absorption coefficients. We design multiple guide-mode resonances by momentum matching of waveguided modes and free-space light via Brillouin-zone folding, thus achieving an 18-nm band edge extension and 1.5 mA/cm2 improvement of the current. The external quantum efficiency spectrum reaches a plateau of above 93% across the spectral range of ~500 to 800 nm. This resonant nanophotonics strategy translates to a maximum EQE-integrated current of 26.0 mA/cm2 which is comparable to that of the champion single-crystal perovskite solar cell with a thickness of ~20 μm. Our findings break the ray-optics limit and open a new door to improve the efficiency of single-junction perovskite solar cells further when compositional engineering or other carrier managements are close to their limits. Further extending the band edge of perovskite approaching the ideal bandgap of single-junction solar cell is essential to improve device efficiency. Here, the authors integrate optical resonances with perovskite solar cells to extend the band edge, achieving EQE-integrated current of 26.0 mA/cm2.","textContent":"IntroductionCompositional engineering to narrow the bandgap of perovskite towards ideal bandgap of 1.34 eV raises the upper efficiency limit of perovskite solar cells1,2,3. So far, the majority of reported champion perovskite single-junction solar cells are based on formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3)4,5,6,7,8,9. FAPbI3 possesses an optical bandgap of 1.48 eV which is both the narrowest and the closest to the ideal bandgap among lead-based perovskites5,6,7,8. However, such compositional engineering route has reached the limit of the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, especially for the selection of A-site cation10. For the selection of X-site, iodide already presents the narrowest bandgap among halide anions10,11. On the other hand, the incorporation of other cations such as tin or germanium on the B-site often incurs inferior stability12.To continue improving perovskite solar cell efficiencies, it is essential to further extend the band edge of perovskite to approach the ideal bandgap of single-junction solar cell. Single-crystal perovskite solar cells (~20 μm in thickness) present narrower bandgaps than that of the submicron-thick (~0.70 μm) polycrystalline thin film counterpart13,14,15. The narrowing of the photovoltaic (PV) bandgap from 1.54 to 1.49 eV stems from the increased absorption length of near-band-edge photons in single-crystal perovskites14. Although it suggests that increasing crystal thickness will extend the band edge further, the fabrication of large-area thick single crystal perovskite is challenging, and it requires higher quality perovskites to minimize charge recombination through 20-μm-thick single crystals. To mitigate the low absorption of submicron perovskite films at the band edge, a strong light confinement needs to be introduced at this spectral regime. Unfortunately, this is impossible for the traditional light-management routes using textures and diffraction which operate in ray-optics regime16,17.Sub-wavelength resonant nanostructures, such as gratings and photonic crystals, sustain strong light confinement and light-matter interaction. These resonant structures have demonstrated promising applications in nano-lasers, nonlinear optics, and photodetectors18,19,20. For light management in solar cells, resonant structures provide a wave-optics solution for surpassing ray-optics limit16,17,21,22,23. Optical resonances have been successfully incorporated in high-index silicon and III-V materials for efficient ultrathin solar cells24,25,26, but are still challenging for perovskite solar cells.We report the integration of optical resonances with perovskite solar cells and extension of the perovskite band edge to maximize the short circuit current (Jsc) without sacrificing other PV parameters. To overcome the low absorption of FAPbI3-based perovskite at the band edge, we demonstrate that multiple guided-mode resonances (GMRs), arising from Brillouin-zone (BZ) folding in a supercell grating, sustain giant light confinement and absorption enhancement near perovskite band edge. In this resonant solar cell comprising a supercell grating and a waveguide slab, normally incident free-space light can be coupled into the perovskite waveguide. This resonant solar cell narrows the PV bandgap by up to 35 meV, which corresponds to 18 nm redshift of band edge, and thus leading to an EQE-integrated Jsc up to 26.0 mA/cm2. The strong band-edge light absorption, together with preserved efficient carrier transport in submicron perovskites, produces a power conversion efficiency of 24.4%. In comparison to ray-optics approaches employing texture and diffraction, the resonant perovskite solar cell manifests pronounced improvements in photocurrent and efficiency, attributed to its unprecedented giant band-edge light absorption (Supplementary Table 1). This folded resonance strategy can be implemented on low-index, low-absorption-coefficient semiconductors, paving the way for the development of efficient ultrathin single-junction and tandem solar cells.Results and discussionOptical resonance for narrowing PV bandgapThe balance between photocarrier thermalization and sunlight absorption identifies an optimum bandgap of 1.34 eV in Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit. For single-junction solar cells, GaAs with a bandgap of 1.42 eV produces a record efficiency of 29.1%4. Likewise, among lead-halide perovskites, FAPbI3 with the narrowest bandgap of 1.48 eV outperforms its perovskite counterparts, including MAPbI3 and CsPbI3 (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 2 for J-V parameters). Although optical bandgap of FAPbI3 is the lower bound of lead-based perovskites, PV bandgap derived from external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum of the devices is 40–80 meV larger than the optical bandgap in state-of-the-art FAPbI3 solar cells5,6,7,8,9,27,28. Beyond optical bandgap, PV bandgap represents the figure of merit for evaluating SQ limit as it considers the deviation of near-band-edge absorption in practical semiconductors2,29,30. In contrast to silicon and GaAs counterparts which have nearly no difference between the optical and PV bandgaps, this 40–80 meV energy mismatch in perovskites provides a large room to further boost Jsc in perovskite single-junction solar cells by optical resonances, especially in FAPbI3-based perovskites (Fig. 1b). FAPbI3-based perovskite is thermally stable and close to the ideal bandgap, rendering FAPbI3 the most attractive perovskite layer for single-junction perovskite solar cells. However, the absorption coefficient of FAPbI3 perovskites is relatively lower compared to MAPbI3, which makes it even more crucial to improve the optical absorption near the band edge of FAPbI3 perovskites (Fig. 1c).Fig. 1: PV bandgap narrowing for efficient perovskite solar cells.a Theoretical Shockley-Queisser (S-Q) limit efficiency (black line) and record cell efficiency of GaAs4, perovskite single crystals (perovskite SC)14, and thin films (FAPbI38, MAPbI341, and CsPbI342) as a function of PV bandgap.

For resonant solar cells, a perovskite waveguide slab with a thickness tw = 680 nm and a grating with a period p = 535 nm and a height tg = 250 nm and a ridge width w = 214 nm are coupled to support multiple guide-mode resonances. e Simulated LHE spectra of mixed-cation perovskite (optical bandgap of 1.556 eV) solar cells with perovskite thickness ranging from 100 nm to 10 μm. f Simulated LHE spectra of perovskite solar cells consisting of 700 nm thin film and resonant structures illustrate resonance modes extending band edge.Full size imageTo realize the band edge extension, we first simulate the light-harvesting efficiency (LHE) in single-crystal and resonant solar cells using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method (see Method for details). In our simulations, LHE is defined as the fraction of photons absorbed by the perovskite layer, while excluding photons that are reflected or absorbed by other layers such as electrodes, transport layers, and glass. It is important to note that LHE is conceptually equivalent to EQE, under the assumption of ideal conversion of absorbed photons to charge carriers, as well as ideal charge injection and collection31.A full “iodide” perovskite FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3 with an optical bandgap of 1.556 eV is employed for this simulation (see refractive index, extinction coefficient and absorption spectrum in Supplementary Fig. 1). The LHE spectra are directly evaluated based on n-i-p devices with single-crystal or optically resonant perovskite light-absorption layers, while SnOx and spiro-OMeTAD are utilized as electron- and hole-transport layers respectively (Fig. 1d). By assuming unity quantum efficiency from absorbed photons to generated carriers, we can extract PV bandgap from first derivative of simulated LHE spectra, i.e. \\({{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}{LHE}/{{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}\\lambda\\) (Supplementary Fig. 2), where λ is the light wavelength. LHE spectra of single-crystal cells illustrate continuous redshift of PV bandgap from 1.590 to 1.510 eV with the increase of perovskite thickness t from 100 nm to 10 μm, demonstrating that more efficient optical absorption near band edges can narrow PV bandgap (Fig. 1e). The PV bandgaps of thick perovskites are even narrower than the optical bandgap, which is caused by tiny but non-zero absorption coefficient below its optical bandgap (Supplementary Fig. 1d)32,33.To extend the perovskite band edge, multiple strong optical resonances should be introduced at wavelengths ranging from 790 to 830 nm. This is mainly because the double-pass optical absorption, evaluated by 2αt where α is absorption coefficient, is below unity at wavelengths above 790 nm for a perovskite layer with a thickness of 700 nm (Supplementary Fig. 3). Moreover, the thickness of perovskite should be kept below 1 μm to guarantee efficient charge extraction. Considering these two principles, we designed a perovskite slab with a thickness tw of 680 nm and a grating with a height tg of 250 nm, a period p of 535 nm, and a ridge width w of 214 nm. The slab and the grating are coupled to introduce multiple GMRs at the band edge. This resonant nanostructure supports GMRs near perovskite band edge, thus leading to a high LHE of 75% at the wavelength of 800 nm and narrowing of PV bandgap to 1.537 eV (Fig. 1f).GMRs in perovskite resonant structuresFor strong light in-coupling at perovskite band edge, we rationally design perovskite resonant structures. Firstly, a single-cell grating, which has one ridge in each unit cell, is coupled with a waveguide slab to host GMRs (Fig. 2a, top). The waveguide slab sustains guided modes with waves propagating via total internal reflection, but these modes located at high momentum cannot be excited by free-space light radiation. A diffraction grating provides an in-plane momentum which is determined by the grating period. This allows the coupling of free-space light into waveguide slab via GMRs. Such mechanism enables sufficient light absorption even under relatively low extinction coefficient due to the strong light confinement. Secondly, a supercell grating with five non-identical ridges in each unit cell is designed to introduce additional GMRs and increase photonic density of state near band edge, thanks to the folding of Brillouin zone (BZ) in these supercell structures (Fig. 2a, bottom).Fig. 2: GMRs in perovskite nanophotonic structures.a Schematic illustration of GMRs in single-cell and supercell gratings.

Gray lines illustrate two photonic bands in a single-cell grating.

Scale bars, b, 1 μm, g, h, 5 μm. a.u., arbitrary units.Full size imageThese resonant nanostructures can be efficiently fabricated in a large area through a nanoimprinting process (see details in Method and scheme of fabrication process in Supplementary Fig. 4). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images illustrate conformal transfer of single-cell and supercell gratings onto perovskites (Fig. 2b). The nanoimprinting method enables large-scale fabrication of resonant structures for solar-cell applications. Grating structures ca. 1 cm2 in area (Fig. 2c, inset) can be successfully transferred onto perovskite in three minutes and the template is reusable. These single-cell and supercell gratings are homogeneous in a long range, which is demonstrated by low-magnification SEM images with clear fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns (Supplementary Fig. 5). X-ray diffraction results illustrate nearly no difference between the thin film and the perovskite resonant structures (Fig. 2c), which suggests that the nanoimprinting process does not introduce additional damage to the perovskites.On the basis of high-quality perovskite resonant structures, we seek to rigorously demonstrate multiple GMRs for light confinement. Angle-resolved reflectance spectra together with eigenfrequency calculations depict the photonic bandstructure of these gratings. For a single-cell grating, we can observe three photonic bands under transverse magnetic (TM) polarization, among which only one mode is near zero angle and perovskite band edge (Fig. 2e). Calculated photonic bandstructure is in line with the measurement results and illustrates three modes with symmetric/anti-symmetric field profiles (Supplementary Fig. 6). In contrast to the single-cell counterpart, two photonic bands are introduced at BZ center near the band edge of a perovskite supercell grating (Fig. 2f). Bandstructure calculation of a supercell grating illustrates replication of photonic bands in momentum space and folding of photonic bands from high momenta to BZ center at zero angle (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 7). Therefore, increased photonic density of state is realized in a supercell grating through band folding, which provides more channels for in-coupling of free-space light into waveguides.Confocal photoluminescence (PL) mapping further evidences enhancement of light-matter interactions after incorporating resonant structures (Fig. 2g, h). Compared to a perovskite thin film with weak and grain-to-grain inhomogeneous PL emissions, pronounced enhancement of PL can be observed in perovskite resonant structures (Fig. 2g, h, Supplementary Fig. 8). The material quality improvement or lattice strain34 for stronger PL can be ruled out by time-resolved PL measurements, which shows similar PL lifetimes for the perovskite thin film and resonant structure (Fig. 2i). We also find that the steady-state PL shows not only enhanced PL intensity but also a redshift of PL spectrum in perovskite resonant structures (Supplementary Fig. 9). Angle-resolved PL spectra further demonstrate bright PL emissions from the photonic bands at wavelengths above 800 nm (Supplementary Fig. 10). Therefore, we rationalize that this PL enhancement is a result of guided-mode resonances near the band edge, which sustain strong near fields and efficient photon emission channels35.Resonant solar cells for PV bandgap narrowingWith the fundamental understanding into GMRs for light confinement, we combine these resonant structures with solar cells. We simulate the light absorption of resonant solar cells based on a full device with nanostructured perovskite absorbers, electrical transport layers and electrodes. By calculating the dispersion of LHE spectra, overlap of transverse electric (TE) and TM resonance modes at 790–820 nm can be observed for a resonant perovskite solar cell with a single-cell grating (p = 510–540 nm) (Fig. 3a). GMR is demonstrated by the magnetic-field distribution under TM polarization (Supplementary Fig. 10). Owing to the device configuration with back-reflection, guided modes are mainly confined in the spiro-OMeTAD layer and coupled with GMRs in perovskites under orthogonal TE polarization. With an optimized grating period of 535 nm, PV bandgap is redshifted to 1.537 eV (807 nm). To further improve the band edge extension effect, we demonstrate a much higher photonic density of state near band edge using a supercell grating (Fig. 3b). In this structure, the dispersion of LHE as a function of the grating period and wavelength indicates additional GMRs which are caused by folding of photonic bands from high momenta to the center of the first BZ (Fig. 3b). We also observed two resonance modes under both TE and TM polarizations (Supplementary Fig. 11). Benefiting from the additional resonance modes, PV bandgap is theoretically narrowed to 1.525 eV (813 nm).Fig. 3: Resonant solar cells with extended PV band edge.Simulated dispersion of light-harvesting efficiency as a function of grating period in resonant solar cells with (a) single-cell, (b) supercell gratings. c Simulated maps of photocarrier generation rates in sub-bandgap (1.480-1.556 eV) spectral regime.

For resonant solar cells based on single-cell and supercell gratings, strong photocarrier generation is observed and its spatial distribution is consistent with the field profiles (Supplementary Figs. 10, 11), indicating that GMRs sustain strong absorption in sub-bandgap regime. In contrast, low photocarrier generation rate is observed in thin-film solar cells.To evaluate resonance modes for solar-cell performances, we compare EQE spectra of solar cells based on thin film, single-cell and supercell gratings (Fig. 3d). The PV bandgap can be determined by the Gaussian distribution of dEQE/dE, where E is the photon energy. The PV bandgap is narrowed from 1.570 eV (790 nm) of thin-film PV to 1.542 eV (804 nm) and 1.535 eV (808 nm) of resonant solar cells based on single-cell and supercell gratings respectively (Fig. 3e). This PV bandgap narrowing allows more photon absorption at the band edge regime. The best resonant solar cells based on single-cell and supercell gratings show EQE-integrated Jsc of 25.6 and 26.0 mA/cm2 respectively. In contrast, thin-film devices show the highest Jsc of 24.5 mA/cm2 only. The statistics of EQE-integrated Jsc of the three samples are in line with this trend, in which average Jsc improvement of 1.5 mA/cm2 is achieved (Fig. 3f). To rule out the possible contribution of light scattering to PV-bandgap narrowing, we also fabricate a solar cell based on a grating with a period of 615 nm, in which resonance modes were intentionally adjusted away from perovskite band edge (Supplementary Fig. 12). The EQE spectrum of this off-resonance (i.e. detuned) grating shows a comparable PV bandgap with its thin-film counterpart, thus highlighting the importance of optical resonances (Fig. 3e).PV bandgap narrowing and Jsc enhancement can be correlated to the GMRs in band edge regime by angle-resolved reflectance measurements of resonant solar cells (Supplementary Fig. 13). For resonant solar cells, suppression of reflection by GMRs can be achieved under both TE and TM polarizations. TE modes, which are lossy in perovskite gratings on the SiO2 substrate, can be coupled into perovskites due to the existence of Ag mirror (Supplementary Fig. 13). Therefore, these resonant solar cells are insensitive to light polarization. Under TE polarization, BZ folding introduces an additional mode with a higher quality factor in supercell grating solar cells which is responsible for a narrower PV bandgap and a higher Jsc compared to single-cell counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 13). Bandstructure calculations also reveal multiple GMRs in these resonant solar cells (Supplementary Figs. 14, 15), which is consistent with the angle-resolved spectra. Therefore, incorporation of multiple GMRs can boost strong absorption and efficient photocarrier generation to narrow PV bandgap and boost photocurrent. This resonant solar cell with a supercell grating has the potential to be applied to other perovskite compositions through the rational design of nanostructures. For instance, we can replicate the effects of giant band-edge light absorption, narrowed bandgap, and enhanced photocurrent using a MAPbI3-based resonant solar cell (Supplementary Fig. 17).Photovoltaic performance of resonant solar cellsWe further compare the photovoltaic performance of solar cells based on these resonant structures and perovskite films. To evaluate the possibility of improving performance using a thicker perovskite, we fabricated perovskite films with thickness t of 900 and 1200 nm, which are termed as thin and thick films respectively (Fig. 4a, b). In comparison, the resonant solar cell has a 930-nm-thick perovskite layer as presented in the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 4c). Thin-film solar cells present a maximum PCE of 23.0% with a Jsc of 25.0 mA/cm2 (Fig. 4d). With increasing t from 900 to 1200 nm, we observe the slightly improved Jsc of 25.3 mA/cm2 in thick-film solar cells, but both Voc and FF are compromised. This stems from poor crystallinity and limited carrier diffusion length in a thicker perovskite layer. Increasing perovskite thickness by 20–30% does not effectively boost Jsc and yet it drops efficiency. On the other hand, resonant solar cells present a more feasible approach for improving PV performance. Resonant solar cells exhibit Voc of 1161 mV, Jsc of 26.3 mA/cm2 and FF of 80.0%, thus leads to a PCE of 24.4%. The Jsc of 26.3 mA/cm2 from J-V curve agrees well with EQE-integrated Jsc. The statistics on 16 devices for each type of solar cells confirm that the efficiency enhancement in resonant solar cells is attributed to increased Jsc (Supplementary Fig. 18).Fig. 4: Performances of resonant solar cells.Cross-sectional SEM images of solar cells based on thin film with a thickness t = 900 nm (a), thick film with t = 1200 nm (b), and resonant nanostructures (c).

Dashed line is a guide to the eye.Full size imageThe shifting of band edge in resonant perovskite solar cells stems from the strong resonance modes. This effect can be clearly observed in light-emitting diodes as illustrated by the electroluminescence (EL) characterization of these three perovskite devices (Fig. 4e, f). We observe enhanced EL intensity and redshift of EL spectrum to 801 nm, arising from strong resonance modes in resonant solar cells. In striking contrast, the device based on perovskite films emits at 795 nm and weaker EL. The poorer EL in the thick film is correlated with its poorer crystallinity and higher defect density (Supplementary Fig. 19). This effect can be understood by the time-reversal symmetry between light absorption and emission36, indicating that resonance modes for light absorption are also applicable to PL emission.In conclusion, we demonstrate resonant perovskite solar cells via coupling multiple resonance modes to boost absorption at band edge. By rational design of a supercell grating, multiple GMRs are coupled into solar cells to achieve 18-nm redshift of band edge, thus leading to ~1.5 mA/cm2 improvement of Jsc. Optical resonance provides a toolbox for sustaining multiple resonance modes to enhance light-matter interactions; our results highlight the power of coupling optical resonance with perovskites in extending the perovskite band edge. We believe that the findings in this work will provide a new route for increasing perovskite efficiencies after other strategies have reached their limits37,38.MethodsMaterialsSnO2 colloid precursor (tin (iv) oxide, 15% in H2O colloidal dispersion) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), Chlorobenzene (CB), isopropanol (IPA), 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), Spiro-OMeTAD, bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and tris(2-(1H-pyrazol- 1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III)-tris(bis-(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide) (Co-FK209) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Lead iodine (PbI2) was purchased from TCI. Formamidinium iodide (FAI), methylammonium chloride (MACl) and phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) were purchased from Great Cell.Optical simulationThe finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method is employed to simulate the optical absorption in perovskite films and resonant structures based on a commercially available software (Lumerical FDTD). The solar cells with glass, electrodes, electron/hole transport layers and perovskite layer are illuminated by a plane wave in -z direction. Periodic boundary condition is applied in x and y direction to simulate the periodic grating structures. Perfectly matched layers (PMLs) are applied in z direction to avoid reflection. The electric field E in each layer is monitored and absorbed light power by perovskites can be expressed as \\(A=\\int \\omega \\cdot {{{{{\\rm{Im}}}}}}(\\varepsilon )\\cdot {{|E|}}^{2}\\cdot {{{{{\\rm{d}}}}}}V\\), where ω is the angular frequency of light, ε is the permittivity of perovskite, V is the volume of perovskite domain. The LHE is calculated by \\({{{{{\\rm{LHE}}}}}}=A/{P}_{{{{{{\\rm{inc}}}}}}}\\), where \\({P}_{{{{{{\\rm{inc}}}}}}}\\) is the incident light power. Photonic bandstructure is numerically simulated by eigenfrequency calculation in COMSOL Multiphysics. Unit cells of supercell and single-cell perovskite gratings are constructed with periodic boundary conditions in x and y directions and PMLs are applied in z direction.Fabrication of resonant structures on perovskitesThe perovskite resonant structures were fabricated by a thermal imprinting method with a negative replica silicon template. The silicon template was fabricated by standard nanofabrication processes. Firstly, ZEP-520A electron-beam resist was spin coated onto silicon and baked at 180 °C for 4 min. The designed patterns are exposed by using electron-beam lithography on Raith under 100 kV and 20 nA followed by developing in ZED-N50. 30 nm Cr was evaporated onto patterns of ZEP-520A resist in an electron-beam evaporation system (AJA International). The pattern was transferred onto Cr after lifting-off the resist and Cr served as a hard mask for inductively coupled plasma reactive-ion etching (ICP-RIE, Oxford Instrument) of silicon. After ICP-RIE, Cr hard mask was removed by hydrochloric acid. To prevent adhesion between perovskite and silicon template, a self-assembled monolayer of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane was decorated onto silicon surface by a vapor process at 90 °C. Thermal imprinting was performed in a EVG 501 wafer bonding system under 10−3 mbar vacuum. A perovskite thin film and a silicon template were combined and kept at a mechanical pressure of 200 bar and a temperature of 150 °C for 3 min.Device fabricationPerovskite solar cells were fabricated with the following structure: indium tin oxide (ITO)/SnO2/FA0.95Cs0.05PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoOx/Ag. ITO glass was cleaned by sequentially washing with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. Firstly, ITO substrate was cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 15 min. Subsequently, ITO substrate was spin coated with a layer of SnO2 nanoparticle film (volume ratio of SnO2 colloid precursor to water is 1:6) at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 s and annealed in ambient air at 150 °C for 30 min. Before transferring to glovebox, the substrate was treated with ultraviolet ozone for 10 min. PbI2/CsI solution was prepared by dissolving 1.4 mM PbI2 and 0.07 mM CsI into 1 mL DMF/DMSO mixed solvent (v/v 94/6). FAI/MACl solution was prepared by dissolving 80 mg FAI and 13 mg MACl into 1 mL IPA. PbI2 was spin coated on the substrate at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Subsequently, FAI/MACl solution was dynamically spin coated on the substrate at 1800 rpm for 40 s. It is worth noting that MACl is introduced to facilitate the crystallization of the perovskite phase but is easily volatized during the coating and annealing process39,40. Then the film was pre-annealed at 90 °C for 1 min inside glovebox and annealed outside of glovebox at 150 °C for 10 min under the humidity of ~35%. After annealing, thermal nanoimprinting was performed to transfer resonant structures onto perovskite thin films. A dynamic spin coating process was employed to apply a 2 mg/mL PEAI/IPA solution onto the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. It is noteworthy that dynamic coating potentially promotes a homogeneous distribution of the PEAI passivator in both the ridge and valley regions of the grating structure. Afterwards, spiro-OMeTAD solution [100 mg spiro-OMeTAD in 1.1 mL chlorobenzene with 39 μL tBP, 23 uL Li-TFSI (540 mg/mL in acetonitrile) and 10 μL Co-FK209 (376 mg/mL in acetonitrile)] was spin coated at 1750 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 5 nm MoOx and 100 nm Ag were thermally evaporated on the substrate sequentially under high vacuum to complete the whole device.Material characterizationsThe morphology of perovskite resonant structures was characterized by SEM (Hitachi Regulus 8230). The refractive index n and extinction coefficient k were collected on a Semilab SE-2000 spectroscopic ellipsometer. Absorption spectra were recorded on Agilent Cary 7000 spectrophotometer. Absorption coefficients of perovskites were determined by measuring the reflectance and transmittance of perovskite thin films with calibrated thickness using SEM. XRD is recorded on an X-ray diffractometer (Malvern Panalytical) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.1542 nm). TRPL measurements were conducted on a PicoQuant FluoTime 300 spectrometer. PL spectra were recorded on a Renishaw Raman and micro-PL system. Confocal PL mapping was measured on a Nikon A1 confocal microscope equipped with a 633 nm continuous-wave laser. Angle-resolved spectroscopy measurements were conducted on a home-built system with a Fourier imaging configuration. Reflectance signals were collected by a 50× objective with a numerical aperture of 0.75 and were detected by a Horiba iHR550 imaging spectroscopy with a 600 mm−1 grating.PV measurementsThe J–V characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were obtained using a Keithley 2400 Source Meter under simulated one-sun AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW/cm2) with a solar simulator (ABET TECHNOLOGIES, Sun 2000) in an ambient environment at 25 °C and ~50% relative humidity. The devices were measured in reverse scan with a 10 mV interval and 10 ms delay time. The EQE was measured using a Bentham EQE measurement system (PVE300-IVT). EL spectra of perovskite solar cells were measured with an integrated sphere and a spectrometer under an applied voltage of 1.2 V.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\n Data availabilityAll data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper is present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Information.ReferencesPolman, A., Knight, M., Garnett, E.

Moore revealed testing alone had already cost the council more than $200,000.Asbestos has so far been found in mulch in more than a dozen City of Sydney parks, including friable asbestos at several sites. The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) has found asbestos-contaminated mulch at more than 60 sites across greater Sydney.The chair of the state government’s asbestos taskforce, Carolyn Walsh, told the council meeting the EPA had been able to trace more than 90% of the contaminated mulch supplied by the company Greenlife Resource Recovery.Walsh said the remaining proportion was “very difficult to trace” and she expected the EPA would provide advice for households concerned they may have received contaminated mulch.\n Sign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\nThe EPA has previously said it was “following up on a possible second supplier” that could have provided asbestos-contaminated mulch.Moore told Monday’s meeting the contamination was caused by a “massive failure of state-based regulatory system” and more than $200,000 had been spent on testing. That did not cover the cost of remediation and replacing the product.Locations where asbestos has been found“The extent of the contamination problem indicates that … the community has been badly let down by the regulatory process that governs the safety of recycled mulch,” she said.“Costs of testing, disposal and remedial work are having and will have a substantial impact on our ratepayers, as is the fencing off and the loss of recreational space for our residents.”Moore told the council it was “shocking” the widespread issue was “only discovered when a child took home a piece of asbestos-contaminated mulch” from the Rozelle parklands in January.“As well as burgeoning costs, our residents have been barred from accessing their parks and open spaces which are contaminated,” she said. “It’s a costly mess.”Asbestos was found in mulch at Rozelle in early January but it took a month before the City of Sydney council was told by the EPA that its suppliers may have received contaminated product.The council then began testing and asbestos was found in mulch at its parks.Asked why the council was not aware that Greenlife was part of its supply chain before the EPA contacted them, the council’s chief executive, Monica Barone, insisted the council had done the right thing.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“This is now the subject of criminal investigation,” she said.“The investigation is under way. We’ll see what the EPA does. But essentially, we did the right thing. We sought assurance, we got assurance.”Barone agreed there was a “bit of a backlog” with regards to testing mulch, with about 13 results being returned to the city each week.Moore called on the NSW government to release a report by the state’s chief scientist examining asbestos in recycled products.That review, however, relates to one type of recycled product only – recovered fines, which is a soil fill product derived from construction and demolition waste including skip bin residue.Guardian Australia revealed in January the EPA had known for more than a decade that producers of recovered fines were failing to comply with rules to limit the spread of contaminants such as lead and asbestos into the community.In response to Moore’s comments the EPA chief executive, Tony Chappel, said the state had a “zero tolerance for asbestos”.“The discovery of contaminated mulch at sites across Sydney is alarming and the EPA is undertaking a major criminal investigation to work out how this has occurred,” he said.“We have a strong framework to prohibit this material and as with any criminal investigation, where anyone has flouted the law or their obligations, we will not hesitate to use our regulatory powers.”Comment was sought from the NSW government.","length":4264,"publishedTime":"2024-03-04T06:27:49.000Z","rating":[7,8,6,5,7,7,6],"reason":[{"Accuracy":"The article provides detailed information about the ongoing asbestos contamination crisis in Sydney, including the involvement of the NSW government, EPA, and the actions taken by the City of Sydney council.

Instead, the two sides have been making rival statements to the media.\nRadev’s consultations with the parliamentary groups will be followed by, as the constitution requires, him handing a mandate to the largest parliamentary group, GERB-UDF, to seek to form a government.\nFrom the time it receives the mandate, GERB-UDF will have seven days to present a proposed government or hand back the mandate unfulfilled.\nIf matters reach the stage of a second mandate, that will go to the second-largest group, WCC-DB, which similarly will have seven days to fulfil it or hand it back.\nAt the third stage, the head of state has a free hand to choose a parliamentary group to which to hand the final mandate. Failure at the third stage, which has no seven-day deadline, would trigger early parliamentary elections.\nOn March 7, Borissov, attending a European People’s Party congress in Bucharest, said that negotiations with WCC-DB would be held on March 8, 9 and 10, while he continued not to rule out early elections.\nMaria Gabriel, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in the Denkov government, has been named by Borissov as head of the GERB-UDF negotiating team.\nThe agreement between WCC-DB and GERB-UDF that put the Denkov government in place in June 2023 envisaged a “rotation” this March that would see Gabriel taking over as Prime Minister, and Denkov becoming Deputy PM.\nHowever, conflict between GERB-UDF and WCC-DB has called into question whether this “rotation” would happen.\nBorissov said that Gabriel should not be an “obedient” Prime Minister, which he contrasted with, in his view, Denkov consulting WCC-DB party leaders before making decisions.\n“She has chosen a support team in the most important areas – justice, energy, construction – she will manage this cabinet and will say which ministers she can work with,” Borissov said, continuing the contrast with the WCC-DB view – as expressed by WCC co-leader Assen Vassilev – that the “rotation” would see minimal changes to the cabinet line-up.\nOn March 7, WCC co-leader Kiril Petkov said: “I hold the invitations in my hands, we are inviting Boiko Borissov, Maria Gabriel and their negotiating team officially on Friday, at a time convenient for them, to start the negotiations”.Petkov said that the basis is reforms in the regulators and in the justice system with one main common goal – to make a Gabriel government a reality.\nDenkov, responding to Borissov’s criticisms that the resignation of the Denkov government had been “hasty” said on March 7: “Both sides have submitted documents, the administration has greatly slowed down its work, they have stopped anti-corruption activities”.\nThe negotiation process must be accelerated, Denkov said: “My appeal is to stop criticising others and sit down tomorrow at the negotiation table”.\nPlease support independent journalism by clicking on the orange button below and signing up to become a patron of The Sofia Globe:","length":4135,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T13:22:27+00:00","rating":[7,8,7,6,7,7,6],"reason":[{"Accuracy":"The article provides detailed and accurate information about Roumen Radev's consultations with parliamentary groups and the process of forming a government in Bulgaria, including specific dates and statements made by key political figures."},{"Objectivity":"The article maintains a relatively balanced perspective by presenting statements and actions from various political parties involved in the government formation process."},{"Clarity and Coherence":"The article is well-organized and structured, presenting information in a clear and coherent manner that is easy to follow."},{"Depth of Analysis":"While the article covers the sequence of events and key players, it lacks in-depth analysis or insights into the potential implications or challenges of the political developments."},{"Language and Presentation":"The language used is generally professional, with a few minor issues in punctuation and sentence structure."},{"Readability":"The article is moderately readable, but certain sections could be more concise and easy to understand for readers unfamiliar with Bulgarian politics."},{"Attractive":"The article presents the information in a straightforward manner without engaging storytelling or elements that would make it particularly captivating to a wider audience."}],"conclusion":1},{"lang":"en","siteName":"teleSUR","link":"https://www.telesurenglish.net/news/Chinese-Minister-Calls-Israels-Attacks-Gaza-Human-Shame-20240307-0022.html","title":"Chinese Minister Calls Israel’s Attacks on Gaza a Human Shame","byline":"teleSUR/ CC","excerpt":"\"It is a tragedy for humanity and a shame for civilization...we are witnessing a humanitarian catastrophe that cannot be stopped\".","textContent":"Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi described the Israeli aggression in the Gaza Strip as a shame to humanity and reiterated Beijing’s demand for an immediate ceasefire.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\nAt the press conference of the second session of the XIV National People’s Assembly, Wang declared: \"It is a tragedy for humanity and a shame for civilization...

With a 17.2km individual time trial to close the race on Sunday, there is no more appropriate place for the 37-year-old to test her legs. Vuelta Extremadura Féminas always the plan for Van Dijk on returnThe Vuelta Extremadura Féminas is not the biggest of races on the calendar for Lidl-Trek – they and Movistar are the only Women's WorldTeams on the startlist – but with three tough stages in Spain on the agenda, Van Dijk had always eyed up this race for his comeback. \"When I was pregnant, we made an ideal plan, which in fact was to come back for this race. We thought this was the earliest I could come back to racing and that was also factoring in that I wanted to breastfeed,\" Van Dijk said. Stages 1 and 2 will see Van Dijk look to re-accustom herself to riding amongst the hustle and bustle of the pack. Her teammates include Gaia Realini, who will target the stage 2 summit finish, but for Van Dijk, stage 3 will be the aim. The pan-flat 17.2km individual time trial should suit Van Dijk, whose last and 66th professional victory came in a test against the clock at Chrono des Nations. \"We picked this race as my first race back because it has a nice time trial in it, so that’s my main goal of these three days,” explained Van Dijk. “I really want to get back into TT mode and see where my level is at this moment. \"We have trained a lot for it already and I am excited to ride a time trial again, especially in my first race back. It’s the discipline I love the most so I am really happy that I can get back to it straight away.\"After a Spanish dalliance, Van Dijk's season will continue with the Spring Classics later in the month, building to the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix.

In comparison, the company’s total sales were only up 6% in the same period. “E-commerce showed strength in several areas led by sales of gold, and very recently silver,” Costco’s chief financial officer Richard Galanti, who is retiring this month, told investors on a call Thursday evening. The news comes as gold prices reached an all-time high this week. The company started selling $2,000 gold bars on its website in September and recently started hawking 25-count tubes of one-ounce silver coins for $675. The company did not disclose how much gold and silver was sold this most recent quarter. However, in its previous quarter the company reportedly sold $100 million worth of gold. Despite this, the retailer still missed Wall Street expectations. The company’s total revenue was up about 6% year-over-year to $58.4 billion in its second quarter, narrowly missing analysts expectations of $59.2 billion, according to FactSet. Costco’s stock slid 4% during after-hours trading on Thursday to about $754.New menu items at the food court Galanti also noted that the company recently replaced its $1.50 churro from its food court with a 5.5 ounce chocolate chip cookie that goes for $2.49. It also added a $6.99 turkey sandwich to its menu. He also teased that the retailer is bringing its made-in-store sushi to two more locations in the U.S. Currently, Costco-made sushi, which is popular in Asia, is only available in the U.S. at the company’s Issaquah, Washington location.

However you rank yourself on a hepcat scale, it’s likely you have never seen a human do such things to a piano.Virelles in ZurichTo comprehend a Virelles performance is to require a new poetic vocabulary, a language custom-made for his fiery athleticism and astonishing precision. Mentioning his Cuban heritage will help. Hat-tipping his tutelage at the feet of Jane Bennett and Henry Threadgill and Chris Potter and Steve Coleman gets you close. But precedence and categorization will not get you there. One must see Virelles to stand appropriately agape at his talent. On a recent winter’s night in Zurich, just as the dominant were descending from Davos, 150 souls braved the winter rain to huddle in a moody club in the city’s industrial district. Virelles emerged humbly, ostensibly there for an evening in promotion of his new album “Carta,” an exuberant blend of Afro-Cubano sounds and avant-garde experimentations. Attendees were party to a series of beautiful violations.Keyboard AthleticismHere was Virelles grasping greedily at the keys, pushing, pulling, and rolling the black and whites, melting hardwood and ivorite beneath his blistering fingers. Here he was, a masseuse maneuvering across a muscled back, pushing the tension toward the edge and dragging it to center again. He plays with his elbows, his knuckles, his wrists. With the hair on his forearm? One wouldn’t be surprised.Then suddenly a shift: He is a child pecking playfully at a toy keyboard. Then: a viper striking with the left hand, landing the bite. Then: a woodpecker, impossibly quick and needle-nosed, penetrating the skin of the surrendered instrument. No, his hands are a pair of ragged claws, scuttling across the floor of roiling seas. He is insistent, obsessed, pounding, and then not touching anything but air—his hands suspended above the keys, sound somehow emitting from a machine now trained to read his mind. At climax, he breaks the wall, keeping his left hand striding, while the right reaches into the piano itself, fingers grazing unhammered strings.Virelles was drenched with sweat, and the sets were short. Just as well, as the rest of us were out of metaphors anyway. The crowd began trickling out, all smiles and headshakes and gestures of astonishment. Virelles was heading back to New York, his able allies of Eric McPherson on percussion and Ben Street on bass with him, having completed a short run of shows in Paris and Geneva. Some of his students were in attendance, proud of their proximity to the preternatural, whose extreme control masquerades as chaos, whose elegance becomes indistinguishable from brute force, whose manipulation of a grand appears as gentleness.It is a kind of mirage, a form of magic. Pee Wee might call it a Virellusion.This review will appear in the Spring 2024 issue of Worth magazine as part of the article “Symphonies of Mastery.”","length":3222,"publishedTime":"2024-02-20T07:00:00+00:00","rating":[8,9,9,7,8,8,9],"reason":"The article scores highly on accuracy as it provides detailed and factual information about David Virelles, his performance, and his album \"Carta.\" It maintains objectivity by presenting a balanced perspective and avoiding significant bias.

Julianna Smith is among them.“[It’s] doubled, it’s a crisis, especially for people who are retired like me, worked all of our lives, have good retirements,” said Smith.” I know some friends are going back to work and it’s sad.”Veteran insurance agent Dan Burghardt who owns an agency bearing his name agrees the crisis persists. “We have to do something about it, we can’t continue to be the highest, sore-thumb rates in the country,” said Burghardt.Insurance Commissioner Tim Temple who took office in January, says Louisiana needs to become more attractive to insurance companies after some insurers failed financially following Hurricanes Laura and Ida. And some stopped writing new wind and hail coverage in the state.He has already instituted some regulatory reforms including allowing insurers to self-report and address some violations.Burghardt thinks that is reasonable.“There shouldn’t be a penalty for violating an underwriting issue that costs the consumer that the company is willing to go ahead and find it, locate it and address it with the department,” he said.Currently, insurers are barred from dropping policies willy-nilly if a property owner has been their customer for three years.Temple wants to change that. But Smith likes the current rule. “I appreciate that rule,” she said.Burghardt was asked about his position on the three-year rule.“There’s very few if any states that have this three-year rule, putting us in a position that is a forcing a wall and a deterrent, that no other states have enforced. So he’s got to take a look at this because this is the concern that comes up with companies not wanting to do business here,” he said. Ben Riggs, executive director of Real Reform Louisiana has issues with the push to amend the rule.Ben Riggs, executive director of Real Reform Louisiana, does not support that idea.“Weakening the three-year rule will make insurance less available and more expensive because it’s going to force more Louisiana families and small businesses onto Citizens, which is the insurer of last resort, and is statutorily required to charge policyholders 10% above the market price. So, I think weakening or abolishing the three-year rule really exacerbates the problem,” said Riggs.He said it could be hard for property owners to get coverage elsewhere.“They could face, would likely face the situation where if insurer “A” drops them because they don’t want to be, they don’t want to keep that policy in that area, why would insurer “B” want to pick up that policy in that area?” Riggs said.Burghardt says there will be insurers ready to take on risk even after one insurer has dropped a property.“So, there’s always going to be a rate for any risk. It’s just a matter of how much is that rate going to be?” said Burghardt.One bill pre-filed for the regular session says even if policies have been in place for three years insurers would be able to notify the insurance commissioner of their intention to non-renew up to 5% of their policies per year for any reason.Temple also wants so-called “file-and-use”. It would allow insurers to file for a rate change and then begin using it.“This bill came last year. I think that the devil is really in the details with this. I would prefer for the Department of Insurance to oversee the industry, to regulate the industry they’re charged with regulating and actually analyze rates before they’re put into use,” said Riggs.Burghardt had a different response.I’m definitely for approval on a deadline. Sometimes these rate filings could take longer than companies are expecting. It gets a 45-day timeframe. So, if a company wants to lower a rate, or raise a rate the department has 45 days suit to approve or disapprove. After that, the company can move forward with it and this will definitely make it a lot easier,” he said.Burghardt says other areas are murky and should be cleared up.“The bad faith comes when a company decides it’s not going to pay a claim in 30 days after the proof of loss is filed. It’s not a definition of what proof of loss is so that ambiguity has to be defined better so that it’s not abused,” he said.Burghardt added that the landscape is getting better and that some new insurers have come in and are offering lower rates if properties have new roofs. So he urges homeowners to shop around.The session kicks off on March 11.See a spelling or grammar error in our story? Click Here to report it.

Photo / Paradise GroupThere has been a twist in the saga of the tourist who claimed she was charged $1000 for a chilli crab at a restaurant in Singapore.On Wednesday, police were called to the prestigious waterfront restaurant after a group of crabby tourists were served a super-sized bill.At the time Junko Shinba, from Japan, claimed that she had expected the dish to cost her $30 but the table of four was charged more than NZ$1000 at Seafood Paradise.Now restaurant owners Paradise Group have released a statement and CCTV footage of the waiting staff bringing the live crab to the table, claiming they had tried to warn the party that they might be making a big mistake.The restaurant said it was “deeply upset by the inaccurate claims made by this group of customers” in a social media post.The tourists said they wanted to try the signature dish of chilli crab – a Singaporean speciality – while on holiday. They told local news site AsiaOne that they ordered a portion of the dish but were served up the whole 3.5kg crab.They called police after receiving the whopper of a bill.The restaurant knocked S$107 off the bill after the group of tourists called the police. Photo / Junko Shinba“We all became speechless knowing that one dinner for four adults cost that much,” 50-year-old Shinba told AsiaOne.“None of us were informed that the whole crab would be cooked only for us, as some other restaurants serve crabs partially,” she said, saying they were served so much “there were three plates full of crab” left over.Paradise Group said: “To prevent any miscommunication, the staff even brought the whole Alaskan king crab to the table before preparation,” offering alternatives to the live crab, which could be served in smaller portions.The customers refused to pay the bill and called police. Eventually, the restaurant offered a S$107 discount on the $1322 meal (about NZ$1600).The restaurant claimed the visitors were delighted with the meal until the bill arrived. In CCTV stills published on Facebook, the restaurant showed guests posing for a selfie with the giant crab.“As much as we value all our customers, we also find it important to uphold Paradise Group’s reputation and protect all our employees. Hence, we are left with no choice but to showcase photos extracted from our CCTV footage to substantiate our statement.”Live seafood is typically served whole, to avoid waste, and it was restaurant policy not to sell portions of living animals.“Dividing it into partial portions would render the remaining portion no longer live seafood,” the statement said.Latest from TravelWhy you shouldn't try this 'dangerous' travel hack'Hack' increases the risk of a head injury if turbulence strikes","length":2807,"publishedTime":"2023-09-22T00:08:38.772Z","rating":[3,6,7,4,7,6,5],"reason":"The article provides details about a $1000 crab dispute at a Singaporean restaurant, presenting the viewpoints of both the tourists and the restaurant owners.

According to the University of Michigan, a male red-winged blackbird’s territory can span more than 2,000 meters, or more than a square mile.\nWithin that territory a bird can have as many as 15 female nesting partners, though more typically they’ll mate with approximately five females, according to the school.\nWith territory that large, it’s no shock that the birds can spend up to one-quarter of their daylight hours defending that land, according to Michigan researchers.\nFortunately, all the loud calls and aggressive defense of nests comes with a benefit for humans, as red-winged blackbirds feast on all manner of insects, spiders and other invertebrates.\nIt’s unclear if their diet includes cicadas, but we will update this story when we get that answer.","length":2309,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T01:42:56Z","rating":[5,7,6,4,7,6,5],"reason":"The article provides mostly factually correct information about the red-winged blackbirds returning to Illinois, their behavior, nesting habits, and interaction with humans.

Spoilers ahead.\n Access your favorite topics in a personalized feed while you're on the go.\n Ariana Grande confirmed fan suspicions on Wednesday when she announced the title of her seventh album: \"Eternal Sunshine.\"Theories had been circulating for days, thanks to coordinates conspicuously placed in the music video for \"Yes, And?\" — Grande's new song and the album's lead single.The coordinates led to Montauk, New York, a key location in the 2004 sci-fi film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\" (She also liked several social media posts, confirming the title's inspiration.)Written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Michel Gondry, the movie follows the meek, brooding Joel Barish (played by Jim Carrey, Grande's favorite actor) and the brash, spontaneous Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) as they fall in and out of love.The story is mostly told through Joel's eyes — specifically through his memories of Clementine, as he goes through a medical procedure to have them erased. He only opts for this to get even with his ex-girlfriend, who'd already erased her memories of him.As the lead technician explains, the procedure is technically \"brain damage.\" But the promise of a \"spotless mind,\" free of anger and heartache, is too enticing.Now's the time to click away if you'd like to avoid spoilers.\n Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet) has Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) erased from her memory.\n As Joel's memories of Clementine are methodically unraveled, he realizes his mistake — the happy memories are torn away, too — but he can't stop the process. He relives their relationship in all its beautiful, infuriating, ruinous glory; he falls in love with Clementine all over again. After he wakes up, she's a stranger. They meet again by happenstance. Neither can remember their history, but they choose to be together all over again.The disjointed narrative is surreal and thought-provoking, at turns tender and disquieting. It's widely regarded as a cinematic masterpiece. It's also my standard answer to the first-date question, \"What's your favorite movie?\"My very first viewing of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" occurred in 2010, when I was 14. I'd go on to reblog many photos of Joel and Clementine on Tumblr, as well as quotes like \"I can't remember anything without you\" and \"I wish I knew you when I was a kid.\"Like many teenagers and hopeless romantics, I misunderstood these characters as star-crossed lovers — victims of impulse and timing who would find each other in every lifetime.I haven't heard Grande's take on \"Eternal Sunshine\" yet, but based on the album promo, I fear she may have fallen into the same trap. She has been using the infinity symbol, paired with the sun, heart, and bubble emojis, in her latest Instagram captions. The lead single is a boppy directive to follow your bliss, haters be damned.\"Everybody's tired and healing from somebody / Or something we don't see just right,\" she sings in the first verse.The healing process is a common theme in Grande's discography, and if \"Yes, And?\" is any indication, it'll reappear throughout \"Eternal Sunshine.\"Of course, healing is impossible without memory, self-awareness, and a capacity to learn from the past — what I recognize now as the whole point of \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\" As I've gotten older, I've grown to understand the movie's final scene as deeply tragic. Joel and Clementine are fundamentally incompatible. They're doomed to repeat their mistakes, to break each other's hearts, and to refeel the pain they tried to erase.In fact, the movie's original script makes this explicit.In Kaufman's first draft, the story ends with an older version of Clementine. She's had her memories erased over and over again for 50 years, \"all of them involving Joel Barish.\"While the actual ending is more subtle and ambiguous, the movie doesn't hide its core message. The spotless mind's biggest champion is Mary Svevo (Kirsten Dunst), a receptionist at the memory-erasure company Lacuna, who truly believes in its mission. She is convinced the procedure gives people a blank slate, a second chance: \"You look at a baby and it's so pure and so free and so clean,\" she says. \"Adults are like, this mess of sadness and phobias. Howard makes it all go away.\"\n Mary secretly loves Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), the lead technician at Lacuna. But she's been in love with him before. She just doesn't remember.It's revealed that Howard pressured Mary into having her memory erased after his wife discovered their affair; she falls in love with him again, and it blows up again. By the movie's end, Mary is staunchly against the procedure, finally awake to its risks and murky ethics.Mary's heartbreak foreshadows the loop that Joel and Clementine will fall into. The \"eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\" is, in short, a lie. The title is meant to be ironic. None of the characters who have their memories wiped are happy or better off because they're emotionally stunted and unable to move on.Perhaps Grande's album will also grapple with these themes: toxic cycles, willful ignorance, the harsh realities of adulthood. But chopping off the second piece of the movie's title doesn't make for a promising start.As a solitary phrase, \"Eternal Sunshine\" evokes optimism and light — the sort of pure, free, clean baby brain Mary reveres before she learns the truth. Unfortunately, adults know that sadness and phobias are a natural part of life. The good stuff can't exist without them.","length":7774,"publishedTime":"2024-01-17T22:26:12Z","rating":[8,7,7,8,9,8,8],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about Ariana Grande's new album \"Eternal Sunshine\" and its inspiration from the film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\" It presents a balanced perspective on the movie's themes and storyline, with a detailed analysis of the tragic elements disguised as romance.

In an interview with WAYA, Ha","textContent":"Co-founded by Emirati entrepreneur Maryam Hassani, the mobile app fills a gap in business networking technology. In an interview with WAYA, Hassani shares the app’s goals, its unique digital solution, and the team’s future plans.\nCan you tell me more about the startup, your customers, and the journey so far?\nMaryam Hassani: Zealous is a networking app that caters to goal-driven individuals in the tech space, enabling them to easily connect and meet with like-minded professionals in their vicinity. Our platform takes a human-centric approach, utilizing innovative features such as geolocation and calendar integrations to streamline the entire networking process.\nTraditionally, networking is a time-consuming and often random practice, requiring extensive research, attending events, and relying on chance encounters. Zealous reimages the experience by seamlessly integrating networking into people’s daily lives. With our app, users can network on the go, effortlessly connecting with those nearby who share complementary goals. We believe that networking should be an integrated part of one’s lifestyle, making it convenient and accessible even with busy schedules.\nThe idea for Zealous began in June 2022 with the vision of eliminating the ambiguity, hassle, and awkwardness typically associated with networking. Since then, we have been hard at work, continuously iterating and improving the app based on valuable user feedback. We have organically built a strong community of over 350 early adopters who have embraced the potential of Zealous to revolutionize the networking experience.\nIn May of this year, we proudly introduced the Zealous app to the community during our launch event. The positive response and enthusiasm from our growing user base have been incredibly rewarding, motivating us to further enhance the app’s functionality and user experience.\nWith Zealous, our mission is to empower individuals in the tech industry to build meaningful connections with ease and intention. We are committed to driving networking innovation and transforming the way professionals meet, refer, and stay connected in the digital age.\nMaryam Hassani: Throughout my five-year journey in the vibrant ecosystem, I recognized the need for a more effective and efficient way to meet and connect with others, especially within a rapidly growing tech scene like in the UAE.\nHaving immersed myself among startup founders, community managers, and other ecosystem members, I deeply understand the challenges faced by members of the tech community. I observed that many talented individuals with immense potential struggled to make meaningful connections due to the inefficiencies and discomfort associated with traditional networking methods.\nParticularly in the tech startup space, networking plays a crucial role in seizing opportunities. I witnessed talented individuals missing out on suitable job prospects or failing to connect with the right people due to their introverted nature or busy schedules. The process of discovering the ideal events and spaces for meaningful connections can be time-consuming and daunting.\nEven for those who are more extroverted, networking can feel like a full-time occupation. It involves identifying the right environments and networks, filtering through numerous individuals who may not lead to relevant connections, and participating in tedious admin tasks all throughout the process. This process often consumes a significant amount of time, which is a valuable and scarce resource in today’s fast-paced world.\nMotivated to reimagine the networking experience, I founded Zealous with the goal of leveraging technology to help people connect and create opportunities seamlessly. I aimed to build a platform that would eliminate the barriers and challenges associated with traditional networking methods, making it easier for individuals to forge meaningful connections and unlock their full potential. \nMaryam Hassani: At the moment, our primary market focus is the UAE tech startup scene. We aim to grow our user base within this vibrant ecosystem and establish a strong presence in the local tech community. To effectively target our market, Zealous engages with four key personas that form the foundation of a thriving tech ecosystem:\nVisionary: These are individuals who have tech startup ideas and are looking to develop or grow their ventures. They can range from first-time entrepreneurs embarking on their journey to seasoned serial entrepreneurs.\nCreator: These are individuals with technical skills, such as developers, designers, and data scientists.

Video circulated online appears to show two of the children tied up and crying. Top state officials say they are \"appalled\" by the footage and police have called for calm in the community. Authorities said the 45-year-old man had called them on Monday to report the incident in Broome, about 2,000km (1,200 miles) north of Perth, telling them he had found the children in an \"unoccupied pool\".Officers arrived to see two children \"physically restrained\" with cable ties and later found the oldest boy who had fled the scene, WA Police said. Footage shared widely online shows two children - who appear to be Indigenous - in a driveway, while onlookers urge a man, who is white, to let them go. Paramedics assessed the two children at the scene and they were reunited with their families shortly after, according to authorities.Police said the \"force used to restrain\" the three children \"was not proportionate\" given their age and vulnerability. The state's children's commissioner, Jacqueline McGowan-Jones, said she was disturbed by the footage. \"It would appear these are very young and small children. They appear to be quite frightened in the circumstances. He is quite a large man. And they appear to be very nervous,\" Jacqueline McGowan-Jones told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Tuesday. \"They don't have the neurodevelopment to understand cause and effect and consequences and actions. And that is legally known,\" she added. The man has been granted bail and is due to appear before the Broome Magistrates Court on 25 March. According to recent government data, Indigenous Australians aged 10-17 are 29 times more likely than non‑Indigenous children to be in detention nationally. Ten is the minimum age of criminal responsibility in Western Australia.

The group show, presented by Amity, features artworks whose subjects beget other memories and associations, which the artists have tried to reimagine through a contemporary lens. This is the case for Cristine Brache and Łukasz Stokłosa, whose paintings focus in on the storied legacy of Playboy bunnies and the palatial estates of Europe’s former aristocrats, respectively. Their paintings are animated by the same morbid fascination with things that have, though they have an objective aesthetic value, are haunted by sad and broken histories. “It feels beautiful, even if it is horrible too,” says Brache, who’s publishing a book of poetry with Wonder Press this Summer. “The spaces we visit, the palaces and museums, are not only these beautiful objects we look at, but have very dark stories behind them,” echoes Stoklosa. After the group show opened, the two artists got on Zoom to talk about the how their works intersect, the disturbing legacy of Ludwig II of Bavaria, and the outbreak of demonic nun possessions in France that continues to fascinate Brache.\nCRISTINE BRACHE: I was really happy to be introduced to your paintings. They’re very beautiful.\nSTOKŁOSA: Yes, and we often use similar sources. You also use vintage footage, right? \nBRACHE: I generate my own. For some of these recent ones I used A.I. I was referencing the older film stills and then making them look how I wanted using the aesthetic of the still itself. But the work is very cinematic in terms of storytelling and frames, in order to really capture a feeling.\nSTOKŁOSA: Yes. It starts from this dark movie feeling, this foggy, shadowy aesthetic. Usually I use a brighter background and then recreate it on canvas. Basically, combining some footage I found, and then recreating it in the aesthetic I want to achieve on canvas. \nBRACHE: Congrats. For that show, does it all feel like one made-up movie in your head? \nSTOKŁOSA: The title of the exhibition was borrowed from the movie, Cries and Whispers, by [Ingmar] Bergman. The atmosphere of the exhibition was inspired by the movie, and I often work like that.\nSTOKŁOSA: Yes. At this show in L.A. there’s going to be a painting from the TV show, Dynasty.\nSTOKŁOSA: It’s of the cake from the wedding. I watched it when I was a kid, so it kind of defined my aesthetic choices, this flamboyant, super wealthy interior and designs. Then I watched Marie Antoinette by Sofia Coppola, and it brings me this feeling that the spaces we visit, the palaces and museums, are not only these beautiful objects we look at, but have very dark stories behind them. But it starts from movies and pop culture.\nSTOKŁOSA: I see that you have one of your works behind you. What’s the subject?\nBRACHE: It’s continued from my series that I did at NADA in December, which was starting with Dorothy Stratten and the Playboy Bunnies. That one’s called Purple Bunnies. I used A.I. to change the image and colors. The symbol of a woman in a bunny suit is very particular. I love Dorothy Stratten, and her biography is so tragic. I was thinking about how people perform, and I use the word performance very loosely, but the performance of how we exist on a day-to-day basis, the different layers of strata that we have with our own privacy in our own personal lives, then what goes out to the exterior. Like, she was always smiling and super happy but then at home, it was a horror. That dynamic is something I’ve been thematically mining since I started making work. When I look at the image of a woman in a bunny suit, it’s obviously manufactured for straight men. It started this mass objectification of women in this specific way that didn’t really exist before Playboy. But it looks very beautiful, so it’s complicated. But those are encaustic works. I work with silk and ink, and then I embed the silk and encaustic, and then paint oil layers on top of that. So it’s a combination of different media. And encaustic makes silk turn transparent. So the ink then floats in this one-millimeter layer, and then on top of that is the glaze. It refracts the light in a vibrant way that looks different from regular oil paintings.\nSTOKŁOSA: When you were talking about these beautiful images of the bunny costume, it reminded me of working with gay pornography, because I also paint these paintings with boys. It’s very similar because we have those very sexy, beautiful situations, but you know what is behind them. But I usually always use vintage porn for my work. And the interesting thing is that, at one time, that was the only place where you could see men kissing on screen, and it was accessible. So it was a place of liberation. But on the other hand, you have this exploitation of people who were basically forced to do that because of a lack of money. It’s both a feeling that something is wrong, but also that it’s so interesting and beautiful.\nBRACHE: Right. It’s such a compelling feeling, to position yourself between those two spaces. Being able to hold both things that are in direct opposition to my constitution is very complex. It feels beautiful, even if it is horrible too. But comfort in discomfort is very important. Otherwise the world becomes very boring, very fast. It also betrays humanity because we all have that range within us, in some capacity. \nSTOKŁOSA: Yes. It’s important to remember that there are both sides in that image. It’s both bad and good, so it’s always your place to decide which side you are on. Sometimes, it’s impossible.\nCristine Brache. Talent Showcase. 32.75 x 26.25 x 1 5/8”. Oil, ink, and encaustic on silk and wood.\nBRACHE: Yeah. Sometimes it depends on my mood, too. It’s like, “Today I’m tired of feeling objectified, and I feel all of this is violence, and I don’t like it.” But then other times, it’s like, “Oh, please objectify me..”\nBRACHE: That’s normal. Nobody wants to be objectified all the time. I don’t enjoy that, but sometimes it feels nice to be an object of someone else’s affection. \nSTOKŁOSA: Again, it’s this public and private situation where sometimes you are forced to be in public, but you don’t want to be. \nSTOKŁOSA: So again, we are back in Versailles. You have to be public as a queen, but you’re this ordinary person who has feelings too. It’s not only the beautiful gold front, it’s something behind those horrible stories.\nBRACHE: It’s what it takes to make that industry of the castle operate, to make it function on that very high standard of living at that time in particular. Do you have a favorite queen or king that you’re most obsessed with?\nSTOKŁOSA: I was obsessed with Ludwig II. He ruled in Bavaria in the late 19th century and he was responsible for those fairytale castles in the Alps. One of the Disney castles was inspired by him. It was a very tragic story because he was insane and very shy and probably gay. He was building all those palaces only for himself, he avoided people altogether. Eventually, he was killed by his servants, they drowned him in the lake.\nSTOKŁOSA: I was obsessed with the castles. Some of them were built with very modern techniques but look medieval. One was a copy of Versailles because he was obsessed with Louis XIV. It was basically a monument for him. \nAmity exhibition Beautiful Fish in a Man-Made Pond at the Wohlstetter house designed by Josef Van der Kar, photograph by Evan Walsh.\nSTOKŁOSA: Yes, a couple years ago. It’s on an island. It’s an exact copy of Versailles. \nBRACHE: That’s wild. Personally I’m obsessed with The Devils of Loudun from France in the 17th century. Ken Russell made a movie about them called The Devils, and there’s a Polish movie about the same nun called Matka Joanna. Her name was Joan. There was a case of possession in the convents and it was an epidemic, way before the Salem witch trials. But French possessions were way more sexual than the Puritanical ones of America. So this nun, Joan, supposedly signed a pact with the devil, Grandier, the mayor of the town. There was a sex pact, and then she started behaving like she was possessed. I mean, she was for sure possessed, but I don’t know by what. \nSTOKŁOSA: By herself maybe? I watched this Polish movie about her, it was based on the novel by Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz [Mother Joan of the Angels].\nBRACHE: Aldous Huxley wrote about it too. That’s the book that Ken Russell’s movie is based on. Ken Russell’s is the campy version, and then the Polish version is more elegant.\nSTOKŁOSA: Yes. It’s from the ‘50s or ‘60s, it’s black and white. \nBRACHE: Yeah. I spent some time in Poland. My ex is Polish, so I was in Szczecin and Krakow. I never went to Warsaw. \nBRACHE: 2011. A long time ago now, just after my graduation. What’s your favorite part of Poland?\nSTOKŁOSA: Krakow, of course. It has everything that I need. There is an airport, so I can go everywhere. The architecture is nice, and it’s varied in different parts of the city. I have my friends there, so it’s a good place to live. How long have you been in New York? \nBRACHE: I’ve been here since COVID, really. I moved from Canada. I was in Canada for four years. Before that, I was in London. I did my master’s there, and before that, I lived in China for two-and-a-half years. Before that, I was traveling around Europe. I was squatting in London, and I was squatting in Greece, and I hitchhiked from Athens to the center of Turkey, and I lived in Turkey for two months. I basically left the US with two-grand and bought a one-way ticket. \nBRACHE: Yeah. I wound up in China, and I was so broke when I got there. It was crazy, but it was a really great experience. That’s when I was in Poland as well. I spent a lot of time in East Germany and Berlin, all up and down Dresden and Leipzig. I drove through the Alps, and I went to Gruyere in Switzerland. That place also looked like Disney World. It was beautiful, the little villages. It looked fake to me, but it was real.\nCristine Brache, Almost Blue. 14 x 17.5 x 1 5/8”. Oil, ink and encaustic on cotton and wood, 2024.\nSTOKŁOSA: Sometimes all those castles and palaces look fake. You mentioned Dresden. For me it looks like a castle or palace from Beauty and the Beast. \nSTOKŁOSA: There’s going to be one picture from Dynasty and the other is Armor from Vienna. It’s renaissance armor and it’s gold shiny objects. For me it’s about masculinity and oppression and the situation when you’re wearing this metal object and it’s defining your position and shape of your body. It’s very oppressive but on the other hand, it’s so beautiful and shiny and you are this prince on the horse.\nBRACHE: That’s funny. I’m understanding Jed [Moch’s, the curator] thinking more with putting our paintings in the same room, because I am showing those bunny works. The bunny suit is definitely a kind of armor. They used to tie the corsets so tight. I mean, my work’s very feminine and yours is very masculine, but it’s masculine in a soft way. It’s like a non-toxic masculinity. People usually think of masculinity as toxic nowadays, but it’s very beautiful, too. When it’s not toxic.\nSTOKŁOSA: Yes. Both masculinity and femininity are defined by the same oppressive rules of society. We both are victims of that.\nBRACHE: For sure. There’s definitely toxic femininity, too. There’s a yin and yang between our work. \nAmity exhibition Beautiful Fish in a Man-Made Pond at the Wohlstetter house designed by Josef Van der Kar, photograph by Evan Walsh.","length":12335,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T12:53:59+00:00","rating":[8,7,8,6,7,7,8],"reason":"The article provides detailed insights into the artworks and conversations between Cristine Brache and Łukasz Stokłosa.

Put simply, as companies fold the number of D&O cases grows, with many directors finding themselves the subject of investigations and litigation. Now with austerity measures coming into force around Europe, further ramping up the pressure on the private sector and leading to more business closures, D&O insurance may be more relevant than ever. For risk managers, D&O policies need to be clear about what coverage they offer and in what circumstances says Edward Smerdon, a managing partner at Sedgwick Claims Management, who says that D&O coverage can be problematic. “D&O policies are unwieldy beasts, with lots of clauses and too many definitions,” he said. Smerdon added that the lack of clarity in D&O policies increases the likelihood of coverage disputes between policyholders and insurers, leaving directors stranded. For Smerdon, coverage issues stem from “drafting problems” in the policy itself.Another key issue that affects D&O insurance is legal jurisdiction. Legal practices regarding indemnification vary hugely from country to country. Smerdon complained: “Half the countries in the world have no legal specification regarding indemnification.” In the context of Europe, he used the example of Holland as a country where the parameters of indemnification are not clear. For multi-national companies, the ambiguity of D&O coverage and varying legal specifications may increase the risk of investigations and litigation.

Arrowhead Game Studios announced on the PlayStation Blog Thursday that the new “Warbond,” as the battle pass is called in Helldivers 2, will focus on electric and energy-based weaponry and “ultra-futuristic armor.” \nYou can check out the new equipment in action by watching the official trailer, but here’s a rundown. In terms of guns, you’ll be able to unlock the LAS-16 Sickle (a short-burst laser rifle that doesn’t require reloading), the SG-8P Punisher Plasma (a plasma shotgun), and the ARC-12 Blitzer (a gun that shoots lightning at close range). There’s also a new stun grenade and pistol.\nThe new armor is part of the EX Series Prototypes series, which at the time of writing doesn’t do much beyond developing more hilarity for lore fans, with descriptions that say the armor can’t be used “near stapled paperwork” or cost billions of Super Credits. These have been in development for at least 12 years in-game, and seem to possess some useful status effects. For example, the EX-03 Prototype 3 includes “a rubber underlayer for insulation” while another generates a “strong magnetic field.” \nTo unlock items in the Warbond, players need to earn medals by completing missions or finding them as loot throughout the map. While some armor suits and helmets are available in the Superstore (the game’s premium store that takes Super Credits, which can be bought with real-world currency), you can unlock armor, guns, grenades, and other cosmetics just by playing the game and earning rewards. Along with armor and guns, the battle pass will also feature new capes and three new emotes, which are arguably the most important additions. \nThe new Warbond couldn’t come at a better time for the game’s community. While mechs, a new enemy type, haven’t technically been announced, numerous leaks have surfaced, with some players even gaining access to the unreleased content. They’ve also been teased heavily on the game’s social media, with propaganda-styled posters announcing the new “EXO-45 Patriot Exosuits” and saying they’re “ready for deployment.” Helldivers have also just been called to liberate Tien Kwan, which is home to factories working on the suits. and has been attacked. The theory is that once the planet is liberated, the mechs will be available. \nThere was also a new patch released Wednesday that nerfed some fan-favorite weapons but added fire tornadoes. So the game is changing up in a big way, arguably the biggest since the developers had to fix all the server and progression problems at launch.","length":2671,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T13:31:45-05:00","rating":[8,7,9,7,8,8,7],"reason":"The article provides detailed information about the upcoming Warbond in Helldivers 2, including the focus on electric and energy-based weaponry, new armor details, how to unlock items, and the additional features like capes and emotes.

That is what we have fed to the minister.\"\n He said Ms Hyslop wasn't surprised that they had called for the heads of CalMac management, but neither agreed or disagreed.\n \"She assured us that we would have far more input and control by islanders going forward,\" said Mr Peteranna.\n \"There is a paper being created by Transport Scotland's ferries division looking at the legalities of direct award which is being presented to the minister in August.\n \"She explained that in her head rather than the current situation there would be more control over what CalMac could and couldn't do.

Mustafa is the chairman of the Palestinian Investment Fund and received training in the United States. Outgoing Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh continues holding meetings even in his new role as the head of a caretaker government, signaling that little has changed beyond symbolism despite the resignation of the Ramallah-based government last week. \n\t\t\tAccess the Middle East news and analysis you can trustJoin our community of Middle East readers to experience all of Al-Monitor, including 24/7 news, analyses, memos, reports and newsletters.\n You have already accessed your free article.

At one stage, while I was recording with the headphones on, our producer Martin Rushent sent the engineer to scare me by jumping down from above. Someone kept flushing the toilet behind me as well.Human League’s Phil Oakey performing in Auckland in February.Credit: Dave Simpson/WireImage“Martin had quite a lot of little jokes for the artists and we did record that song in a toilet with quite a cheap microphone, a Shure SM58. But I’m not complaining.”For a legion of fans, The Human League were the definitive band of the 1980s. Formed in 1977 by Oakey, Adrian Wright, Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh, its best-known line-up evolved three years later in a flurry of heavily kohled eyes, asymmetrical haircuts and a moody video inspired by a 1973 French movie called Day For Night and shot on 35mm film.Ware and Craig Marsh left in 1980 to form Heaven 17, and Oakey, a former hospital porter whose flamboyant, sexually ambiguous style led the band’s look, had to honour an upcoming tour and album release for record company Virgin.He found new band members, Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley, two 18-year-old schoolgirls dancing in the Crazy Daisy Nightclub in Sheffield, who had no professional singing or dance experience. After a UK and European tour – Catherall and Sulley ironically performing at a Doncaster concert they already had tickets for – they recorded the 1981 album Dare.Its success was stratospheric. Three moderately successful singles, The Sound of the Crowd, Love Action (I Believe in Love) and Open Your Heart were followed by Don’t You Want Me, which, despite Oakey’s dislike for its “poppy” sound, topped the charts globally, achieved platinum status for Dare, and sparked one of the most memorable pop music videos in history.The Human League at the time of Dare (from left): Jo Callis, Joanne Catherall, Phil Oakey, Philip Adrian Wright, Susan Ann Sulley and Ian Burden.Credit: VirginIn March, The Human League, including Oakey, Catherall and Sulley are touring Australia, playing the entirety of Dare live.Some concerts sold out immediately but Oakey is modest.“Me, Joanne and Susan, we shouldn’t have been able to have this, not exactly easy or a good life, but an interesting life,” he says. “We’ve ended up getting respect we’re probably not due, because, in my case, people have treated me as a musician for the whole of my life. That is miraculous.”‘We’re not musicians. We never trained. We’ve managed to continue as a band by always just feeling lucky about everything we’ve ever done.’Phil OakeyIt was also, at times, financially crippling. The band have endured ups and downs, including using the royalties from Dare to record a not-as-popular next album; their music going out of fashion; and unprofitable touring. In 1998, a seven-week tour garnered them £7000 (AU$18,000).“We are still incredibly lucky,” Oakey says. “We’re not musicians. We never trained. We’ve managed to continue as a band by always just feeling lucky about everything we’ve ever done. I have never been the greatest songwriter in this group. I’ve never been the best singer in this group. I’m not a very good frontman or anything, we just do our best and hope that the audience will fill in the rest.”Does he think he has a good singing voice?“I have been guilty of contradictory statements about this,” Oakey says. “I always used to say that the woman I married told me I was tone deaf. But, when I think about it, I was also in a school choir doing Bach’s Christmas Oratorio. So I must have been able to sing.“Some of [my singing] it is just poor imitations. If I ever get to a point in the studio where I don’t know what I’m doing, I think, ‘What would Iggy Pop do now?’ Or, ‘What would David Bowie do now?’ And I try and move in that direction.”Which is?“Probably go a bit lower,” he says, laughing. “I think pop music is not really about showing off or great singing. It’s about communicating with people. It’s for someone in a bed-sit with a little record player going, ‘Oh God, there’s someone else out there that feels what I feel’. That’s more important than impressing people because you’ve got a big vocal range, or you can do 15 notes in a second.”The sight of Oakey, Sulley and Catherall, their three faces staring moodily together, their satiny clothing, high heels, floppy fringes and strong make-up, is as distinctive as their music. Oakey is less recognised now – “I’m not that guy. I’m a bald, old guy with a stick-on beard” – but he recalls his look’s genesis after seeing Roxy Music in Sheffield in the late 1970s.“These five guys with a Moog synthesiser and a Mellotron walked on stage in high heels and sequins and my life changed,” he says. “The next day, I went out and got some make-up and started trying it on. I got the heels later.”His lop-sided haircut came after he asked a similarly coiffured girl on a bus who her hairdresser was.“Chopped on one side and I grew out the other,” he says. “As a hospital porter it got me some funny looks in the wards, but that was OK.”For this tour he’s still in stack heels and platforms, always in flared trousers, but is less reliant on make-up. “There comes a time in your life when your eyeliner won’t go on properly,” he says. “But, I’ve got some ideas. I enjoy my clothes. I hunt out different designers, because I still want to give people something worth looking at.”Human League: Catherall, Oakey and Sulley.Credit: Simon FowlerAfter nearly five decades of The Human League, Oakey still relishes far-flung stages. “I’d tour nine months of the year,” he says. “I’m not really bothered about being at home. I love going somewhere new, I’m amazed at how many younger kids do like our music and I love meeting people that I’ve not talked to before.“I cannot wait to get over to Australia. We know we’ve got some tracks that mainly people who turn up to see us will like and we kill ourselves rehearsing them and making them as good as we can.”LoadingFor the Dare tour, the 17-strong crew and band are carefully freighting some of their 200 synthesisers from Sheffield.“We can’t hire them in because then we’d sound like a cover band,” Oakey says.Oakey’s passion for electronic instruments, and the band’s place as synth-pioneers, is partly why mega electronic instrument event Synthfest UK is held annually in Sheffield.“It’s truly fantastic,” he says. “You just walk into a room where there’s hundreds of bald guys with round glasses making horrible noises. I’ve bought two different voltage-control filters in the last two days alone. You can’t ever get enough of it.”The Human League are at the Palais Theatre on March 9 and 14, Enmore Theatre on March 8 and 13 and the Fortitude Hall on March 6.Find out the next TV, streaming series and movies to add to your must-sees.

Here’s how parents and teachers can respond","byline":"Gabrielle Hunt","excerpt":"There have been disturbing reports of students making sexual moaning noises at teachers and other students. This includes students in both high school and primary school.","textContent":"There have been disturbing reports of Australian students making sexual moaning noises at teachers and other students. This includes students in both high school and primary school. \nAlong with making moaning noises, students might play pornographic audio in class. These behaviours can make students and adults feel uncomfortable, embarrassed, intimidated or humiliated. But it might not always be immediately obvious how it has affected those involved.\nFor teachers and parents, it can be hard to know what to do.\nRecent findings from the Australian Child Maltreatment Study found adolescents make up a substantial proportion of perpetrators of child sexual abuse and this has increased over time. \nOur soon-to-be-published results (as part of the child maltreatment study) suggest rates of peer sexual harassment are also on the rise. Although the maltreatment study did not specifically measure “moaning”, it paints a picture of how common issues like peer harassment and harmful sexual behaviour are in Australia. \n One-third of childhood sexual abuse is perpetrated by another child. Shannon Molloy tells his story – and urges us not to look away\nThis kind of behaviour can sometimes be dismissed as a “joke”. But normal sexual behaviour in children and adolescents only includes behaviours that involve shared decision making and are consensual, mutual, reciprocal and enjoyable. \nSexual behaviours may become problematic when they are developmentally unusual or socially unexpected. Behaviour may be considered normal in some contexts but not others. \nSexual behaviours where there are imbalances of power, a lack of informed consent, use of force or coercion, or even violence, can be considered harmful or abusive. \nMoaning at other students or teachers may be either problematic or harmful, depending on the context and circumstances. \nSpecifically, moaning can be considered a form of sexual harassment, which the Australian Human Rights Commission describes as: \n“any unwanted or unwelcome sexual behaviour” that makes someone “feel offended, humiliated or intimidated”.\nAs a teacher or parent you might experience a range of reactions to observing or hearing about a child moaning at their peers. Some may feel overwhelmed and distressed, while others may brush it off as “no big deal” or kids “not really knowing what they are doing”. \nIt is important to not overlook these behaviours. Equally, don’t normalise them with comments like “boys will be boys”. Remain calm and try not to demonise children.\n If children are making sexual noises at school, do not dismiss it as ‘no big deal’.\nResearch shows most children and adolescents who engage in offensive, harmful or abusive sexual behaviours, will not go on to be adult sex offenders. With the right support and balanced responses we can prevent it from happening or escalating to more serious behaviours. \nRegardless of if you are supporting a child or adolescent who is engaging in or experienced these behaviours, it is important for teachers and parents to:\n1. take it seriously: children and adolescents benefit from adults holding them accountable for their actions while also meeting them with care and support. By finding this balance, we safeguard both the child or adolescent engaging in the behaviour, as well as those who are affected \n2. understand the problem: these behaviours might happen for a range of reasons. It could be due to a lack of understanding, exposure to pornography, a desire to be accepted by peers, or experiences of abuse and adversity. Each child might need a different response\n3. seek support: don’t try and deal with this on your own. Parents can ask their school counsellor or wellbeing unit for help. They can also look at wider resources around young people and sexual behaviour. If teachers are dealing with this in their classrooms, they can seek supervision and guidance from other colleagues. They should also be aware of their obligations to report to police and child protection in cases of child abuse and neglect. Training can also be helpful to learn how to cope with these kinds of behaviours \n5. get specialist help: you can also contact an organisation providing specific services for children or adolescents experiencing or displaying sexualised behaviours. Bravehearts in Queensland has national information and a support line. There are also specialised sexual assault services in each state or territory \n5. talk to your kids about healthy relationships: research shows comprehensive sex education works to prevent harm to children by teaching healthy relationships. This includes helping them to understand boundaries, the importance of informed consent and addressing “boys will be boys” attitudes\n6. prioritise self-care: dealing with these issues can be incredibly confronting and even triggering. Look after yourself. This will help you respond calmly using the support of experts to help children and young people stop offensive, harmful or abusive sexual behaviours.

Its surge in lobbying spending reflects one way it has capitalized on the financial and legal problems of the once 5 million-member NRA in the hopes of expanding the GOA’s political clout, say gun experts.“The GOA was formed in the 1970s because they believed the NRA was too liberal,” said Robert Spitzer, the author of several books on guns and a professor emeritus at Suny Cortland in New York. “True to its creed, the GOA has opposed every manner of gun law and attacked the NRA at every turn.”The GOA’s anti-gun control posture was underscored by its opposition to a bipartisan compromise gun control bill in 2022 that closed some gun law loopholes, including for prospective buyers under 21, and implemented gun violence prevention policies, becoming the first gun control bill enacted since 1994.The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act garnered just 29 Republican votes in Congress, but the GOA this year in an alert to its members warning of pending legislative threats suggested those votes were “cowardly”.The GOA’s lobbying efforts in 2022 were notable in another way: it was the only gun rights group to increase its spending in 2022 according to OpenSecrets, and surpassed the NRA’s lobbying expenditures of $2.6m last year, a drop of over $2m from the NRA’s 2021 total.Through the first six months of 2023, the GOA spent $1.8m on lobbying, putting it on track to equal or surpass the $3.2m it spent last year.As it has ramped up its influence activity in Washington, the GOA also touts its member chapters and allies including the California Gun Rights Foundation and other ones in Florida, Pennsylvania and Texas.Nationally the GOA and its chapters have flexed their lobbying and legal muscles in some significant fights in several states. For instance, in New Mexico the GOA has claimed success in obtaining a temporary restraining order against new gun curbs in Albuquerque.On the legal front, the GOA has also filed amicus briefs – with help from the conservative lawyer William Olson, who put forward some aggressive schemes to Donald Trump in late 2020 as he sought to overturn his election defeat – in at least two major cases pending at the supreme court where the GOA is seeking to thwart existing and new gun regulations. This month the court heard arguments in US vs Rahimi that could overturn a 30-year-old ban on guns for individuals under domestic violence restraining orders.Gun experts say the GOA has long tried to outflank the NRA on the right as the most implacable opponent of gun control measures, and now sees an opening to expand its influence in federal and state battles over gun control.The NRA has reportedly lost about 1 million members since 2019. Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images“With the mostly self-inflicted damage the NRA has suffered, the GOA very much wants to replace the NRA as the nation’s pre-eminent gun rights group,” said Spitzer. “To that end, it is raising and spending more money, filing more suits against gun laws, and has formed its own Super Pac and political victory fund. These and other tactics mimic the NRA’s traditional political playbook.”In Spitzer’s eyes, “the GOA’s prospects for success depend on the extent to which the NRA can recover from its reversals and retain the loyalty of gun owners”.The NRA has reportedly lost about 1 million members since 2019 after allegations of financial misconduct surfaced and the New York attorney general sued the CEO of the NRA, Wayne LaPierre, and other top executives for using the NRA as a “personal piggy bank”.Some ex-members of Congress say that historically the GOA has tried to exploit a perception that the NRA is too moderate.“For years, the NRA had concerns about losing members to the GOA and other extreme groups,” the former Republican congressman Charlie Dent said. “Any time the NRA tried to compromise on something, the GOA would accuse them of selling out.”Likewise, gun control advocates and ex-NRA officials say the GOA has been moving to fill the gap created by the NRA’s woes.“The NRA’s loss has been GOA’s gain,” Kristen Rand, a veteran lawyer with the Violence Policy Center, a gun control advocacy and research group, told the Guardian. “GOA makes the NRA look thoughtful and moderate. No matter how minor a change in rule or statute, GOA always portrays it as a sweeping gun ban.”Such hardball tactics have coincided with an uptick in the GOA’s federal campaign spending to expand its influence. The GOA donated $147,500 to Republican federal candidates last year, more than double what the group donated in 2018 to federal candidates, according to OpenSecrets.Further, the GOA last year established a Super Pac, the GOA Victory Fund, which spent $2.6m on federal races in last fall’s elections.The GOA did not respond to calls seeking comment.To keep the heat on Congress by mobilizing its members, the GOA regularly posts feverish alerts. Several alerts this year have bashed regulatory moves by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) and other efforts to tighten gun curbs in response to rising deaths from gun violence, and mass shootings in Maine, New York, Texas and other states since Joe Biden became president.One GOA alert this year broadly condemned the ATF as a “rogue executive branch that flat out hates gun owners and the constitution”.Other GOA alerts warn darkly of threats of new gun control bills after last year’s bipartisan measure passed, including a possible assault weapons ban that Biden has called for, but which is deemed unlikely while Republicans control the House.Convention attendees look at handguns at the Browning booth at the 2018 National Shooting Sports Foundation’s Shooting, Hunting, Outdoor Trade Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Photograph: Ethan Miller/Getty ImagesOne alert warned: “Now, Biden and the anti-gun lobby are dialing up the pressure on the same cowardly Republicans to find support for the next item on their endless wish list of gun control … a national ban on so-called ‘assault weapons’ and normal capacity magazines.”Gun control advocates say the GOA’s scare tactics are out of sync with reality.“Gun Owners of America peddles hyperbolic falsehoods about any and all attempts by Congress to slow the devastating toll of gun violence in our nation,” said Adzi Vokhiwa, the director of federal affairs for Giffords, a gun control advocacy group.“They even oppose every effort by the ATF to simply enforce gun laws.“Gun safety laws limiting the availability of firearms to people with a history of dangerous behavior can and do co-exist with the ability of law-abiding gun owners to freely exercise their second amendment rights, despite GOA’s false claims otherwise.”Other anti-gun control groups have also ramped up their lobbying and legal drives.The National Shooting Sports Foundation (NSSF), which represents the firearms industry, has outspent the NRA on lobbying in recent years. In 2020 and 2021, the NSSF reported spending $4.6m and $5m respectively on federal lobbying. By contrast, the NRA spent $2.2m and $4.9m.Some ex-NRA officials downplay the influence of the GOA and other pro-gun groups in the wake of the NRA’s problems.“The void created by the self-inflicted and fatal chaos that is the current NRA is being filled by numerous other pro-gun organizations,” a former NRA executive said, adding that this situation “is more of a reflection on the demise of the NRA, than the effectiveness of other organizations”.Another ex-NRA honcho quipped: “GOA’s rise corresponds to when the NRA started going down the crapper.”Assessing the GOA’s impact and expanded lobbying efforts, the Violence Policy Center’s Rand stressed: “As the NRA has lost its footing, its more extreme members have embraced GOA. The group’s expanding influence can only drive pro-gun positions on legislation even further to the right.”","length":8613,"publishedTime":"2023-11-17T13:00:11.000Z","rating":[8,7,7,6,8,7,8],"reason":"The article provides a factual account of the rise of the Gun Owners of America (GOA) as a potent pro-gun lobbying group in the United States.

The structure and organization of the article are clear and coherent, following the chronological growth and impact of the GOA. While the analysis delves into the GOA's strategy and impact on gun control legislation, it could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of the broader implications of the GOA's rise on American gun policy. The language used is appropriate, and the presentation is engaging, capturing the reader's attention with notable facts and quotes from relevant sources. The readability of the article is good, though some complex legal and political terms could be simplified for a broader audience.","conclusion":1},{"lang":"en","siteName":"The New Arab","link":"https://www.newarab.com/opinion/israels-war-gaza-channelling-shame-action","title":"Israel's war on Gaza: Channelling shame into action","byline":"Sarah Amr","excerpt":"Since the start of Israel's genocide in Gaza, Palestinians have been forced to beg the world for empathy. But the shame is not ours to bear, writes Sarah Amr.","textContent":"Instead of allowing shame to immobilise us, we must use it as a revolutionary sentiment, writes Sarah Amr. [Getty]Shame is the visceral - sometimes suffocating - sensation that tightens your chest and weighs heavy on your shoulders. It's the hot flush that creeps up your neck, the prickling sensation of eyes on you, judging.\nIt's the sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, the urge to shrink away, to hide from the world. Shame is a primal instinct, an instinct to retreat, to protect oneself from the gaze of scrutiny. \nFor millions of Palestinians worldwide, forced to bear witness to the genocide of our people in Gaza, shame weighs heavily, a constant companion in the face of overwhelming helplessness.\nIt's the guilt for surviving while others suffer, for eating while others starve, for living while others perish.\nThis shame is not merely a solitary burden; it's a shared anguish felt by a people collectively marginalised and oppressed, whether in occupied Palestine or the diaspora.\n\"There's an inevitable shame that comes when we are forced to beg for empathy and solidarity, to plead for action from a world that turns a blind eye to our plight\"\nIt is a collective feeling of shame stemming from the excruciating pain of witnessing 30,000 of our loved ones killed, tens of thousands injured, and millions displaced and starved while we are trapped behind geographical barriers.\nBearing witness to the atrocities inflicted upon our people, as Palestinians, we are compelled not only to endure the physical and psychological toll of violence but also to confront the moral and ethical implications of our experiences, and we feel a sense of responsibility to ensure that the world acknowledges and addresses the injustices perpetrated against us. \nWe often find ourselves oscillating between moments of pride and moments of profound shame. There are moments when we feel proud, like prophets, with a great sense of purpose and a vivid vision for liberation. We take pride in our resilience and resistance against the occupation that seeks to diminish our humanity and strip away our rights.\nAnd then, there are moments when shame takes over, accompanied by guilt, as we confront our reality; displaced, besieged, and brutalised by a merciless killing machine.\n\"The attack on Palestinian dignity is seen - and felt - by many as psychological murder by a million cuts\"\nIt is necessary to distinguish shame from mere anger at Israel’s actions. Our collective shame stems from the frustration of being unable to enact systemic change that could alter the power dynamics and bring about any change. \nYet, this shame is not ours to bear. It is a shame that should weigh heavily on the perpetrators, on Israel’s leaders and everyone who makes up Israeli society.\nThe statistics speak volumes: 44.3% of Israelis demand the government negotiate for the release of hostages without wanting to stop fighting, while 57.5% believe the Israeli Occupation Forces were using too little firepower in Gaza.\nHow can they justify such callous disregard for human life? How can they sleep at night knowing that their actions are the reason for suffering and devastation? It's not just shameful — it's an indictment of their humanity.\nThe Jewish community must be enraged and ashamed that genocide is being committed in the name of their faith and identity. It is a moral imperative for individuals within the Jewish community to confront the uncomfortable reality that the actions of the Israeli government has weaponised the Jewish faith in its campaign of ethnic cleansing, perpetuate a never ending cycle of violence.\nWestern societies, those directly sponsoring Israel’s war, must feel ashamed that their countries and tax money is aiding in Israel genocide. But they often find it easier to turn a blind eye, scroll past the pictures, or hide behind the notion that ‘it’s complicated,’ refusing to acknowledge their own complicity in our suffering.\nIt’s true that there have been major protests across the Western world actively opposing Israel's actions, it's also crucial to recognise that this may stem from a sense of shame regarding their governments' policies in the current moment rather than a genuine commitment to justice and Palestinian liberation. \nWhen the bombardment started on Gaza following Oct 7th, Palestinians and allies used social media to raise awareness and mobilise for action. On these platforms, there emerged a need to shame others, to call out complicity and silence in the face of suffering.\n\"In a world devoid of shame, pride and dignity are the last bastions of resistance, and our commitment to bearing witness is an act of defiance against the oppressive forces that seek to silence us\"\nBut should it really fall upon us to beg for recognition and compassion in the face of such blatant atrocities? Is it not an indictment of our collective (im)morality that we must resort to such measures to awaken the world to the horrors of genocide?\nThere's an inevitable shame that comes when we are forced to beg for empathy and solidarity, to plead for action from a world that turns a blind eye to our plight.\nBut there’s another angle to consider: Karl Marx proposes that shame can be a revolutionary sentiment. Perhaps, by confronting and understanding our shame, we can use it as a catalyst for action.\nInstead of allowing shame to immobilise us, it can liberate us. I acknowledge that shame, as a feeling on its own, cannot and won't necessarily lead to our liberation. It's reductionist to argue otherwise. But within the confines of this genocide, our collective shame, heartache, anger and guilt can spur us to take more action for Gaza. \nIf Marx’s assertion holds true - that shame is indeed a revolutionary sentiment - then I’m compelled to wonder: how much longer must we endure our shame before we turn it into action? And how much longer will the world remain blind to its own complicity, refusing to acknowledge its shameful silence and inaction?\nIn a world shamelessly draped in the cloak of neoliberalism, where profit margins are supreme and human lives are mere bargaining chips, Palestinians are left to bear the burden of shame alone.\nFor 150 days, the international community has turned a blind eye, conveniently deafened by the cacophony of capitalist interests, particularly in the lucrative weapons and war industry. Behind closed doors, arms deals and military contracts fuel the machinery of war, lining the pockets of corporations and governments alike.\nIt's a world where morality takes a backseat to market forces, where the price of silence is measured in Palestinian lives.\nIn this world, where promises of democracy ring hollow, complicity continues with no shame. Western nations, the guardian angels of freedom and justice, hide behind the illusion of democracy while their tax dollars fuel the flames of oppression. It's a grotesque hypocrisy, where silence is complicity and inaction is endorsement.\nAnd yet, despite the weight of shame, Palestinians refuse to succumb to despair. We remain steadfast in our resilience, our humanity unyielding in the face of brutality.\nFor in a world devoid of shame, pride and dignity are the last bastions of resistance, and our commitment to bearing witness is an act of defiance against the oppressive forces that seek to silence us.\nSarah Amr is a Palestinian writer interested in media discourse and liberation movements.

(Source: Rotorua Daily Post / Andrew Warner)Owner Terry Hammond needs a new jetty to resume operations and has been told that, as a commercial operation, he must pay to build it – potentially costing up to $460,000 – then gift it to the iwi lakebed owners and lease it back.The steamer was described as an “eyesore” at the closed-door July meeting of the protocol committee, which comprises three elected council members and six Pukeroa Oruawhata Trust appointees representing Ngāti Whakaue.After another discussion about the vessel in the November meeting, the council ordered Hammond to remove the boat by July 15.The council letter said the protocol committee “worked on matters relating to the gifted reserves of the city”, including Government Gardens.“This letter therefore serves as formal notice that the vessel must be removed from the reserve by 15 July, 2024, as per the committee’s decision,” the letter stated.'Slap in the face of democracy'Councillor Robert Lee wants the Ngāti Whakaue Gifted Reserves Protocol Committee disestablished. (Source: Laura Smith)Lee told Local Democracy Reporting he believed the “secret” nature of the meetings where the boat’s future was discussed and the decision-making process were a “slap in the face of democracy”.He was concerned about council staff acting on decisions of the protocol committee.He and former Rotorua resident Justin Adams have lodged complaints with the Ombudsman claiming the protocol committee process was not fulfilling requirements for the public notification of meetings, public availability of agendas and reports, and public access to meetings or minutes.Adams previously received the committee’s November meeting agenda – marked “confidential” – via an official information request.Lee submitted a notice of motion for January’s full council meeting calling for the protocol committee to be disestablished and for elected members to review and reconsider any decision it had made. He said, in his view, it offered an opportunity to “correct improper decision-making arrangements”.The notice of motion was rejected. Interim council chief executive Gina Rangi told Lee in an email the meeting chairwoman, mayor Tania Tapsell, can direct the chief executive to refuse a notice of motion for specific reasons.Rangi said the motion did not provide enough information to satisfy the decision-making provisions of the Local Government Act and allowing it could open the council up to judicial review.Tapsell said in the meeting that a transparent local government followed standing orders and processes to have as accurate as possible information on the table.“We must ensure order in this council agenda and we can’t have people bringing their personal opinions to the table when this council has no ability, or perhaps no desire, to disestablish a committee.”In a later item, councillor Trevor Maxwell said he was not impressed by Lee’s “constant criticisms of Te Arawa”.“This is one person’s view.”Lee responded by repeating his concern staff were acting on decisions made in protocol committee meetings.Council response and committee explainerCouncil corporate planning and governance executive director Oonagh Hopkins told Local Democracy Reporting the Gifted Reserves Protocol was negotiated between the council and Ngāti Whakaue.The council approved the protocol in 1996 for the management of the Ngāti Whakaue-gifted lands, such as Government Gardens and the Lakefront Reserve. This would involve casual or other regular meetings at least six-monthly.The protocol committee was formed for this reason but she said it had “no delegated decision-making power and does not have the ability to direct staff”.Asked about the letter referring to the committee’s “decision” on the Lakeland Queen, she said the protocol committee “may make resolutions/decisions but these don’t have any legal effect unless the council [organisation] agrees with the committee’s views”.She said council staff concerns about the Lakeland Queen’s extended slippage were noted in a report to the committee in July.Hammond was told after the meeting he would need to plan for its removal, she said.In November, the committee “formally requested” a six-month removal notice.“In this case there was agreement and staff took the appropriate action, having previously granted a number of extensions to the Lakeland Queen owner.”Asked why agendas and minutes of the committee’s meetings were not on the council website, Hopkins said meetings with iwi partners were not “meetings of a local authority” under the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act.“However, the meetings are not secret.”Hopkins said a summary of each meeting was included in its progress reports to the council.More on this topicPukeroa Oruawhata Trust was approached for comment.LDR is local body journalism co-funded by RNZ and NZ On Air.","length":5760,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T22:06:13.498Z","rating":[5,6,7,4,6,6,6],"reason":[{"Accuracy":"The article provides a detailed account of the controversy surrounding the Ngāti Whakaue Gifted Reserves Protocol Committee, the decisions made, and the responses from involved parties.

The ship was hit by missiles on February 18 while sailing through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. The crew then abandoned the vessel and evacuated to safety.\nThe Houthis – who say they have been targeting ships linked to Israel, the US and the UK in an attempt to pressure them to end Israel’s war on Gaza – claimed responsibility for the attack.\nMohammed Ali al-Houthi, the head of the Houthi supreme revolutionary committee, said that the group held UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and his government responsible for the vessel sinking because of their support for the “genocide” and “siege” in Gaza.\n“Sunak has a chance to recover the Rubymar by allowing aid trucks into Gaza,” he added in a post on the social media platform X late on Saturday.\nThe Houthis have held Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, since 2014, after expelling the country’s government. The rebels have fought a Saudi-led coalition since 2015 in a stalemated war. They control much of Yemen’s north, while the country’s internationally recognised government is based in the southern port of Aden.\nAhmed Awad Bin Mubarak, the prime minister of Yemen’s internationally recognised government, called the ship’s sinking “an unprecedented environmental disaster”.\n“It’s a new disaster for our country and our people,” he wrote on X. “Every day, we pay for the Houthi militia’s adventures, which were not stopped at plunging Yemen into the coup disaster and war.”\n“Without immediate action, this situation could escalate into a major environmental crisis,” said Julien Jreissati, the programme director at Greenpeace MENA.\n“As well as any further leaks of fuel oil from the engines, the sinking of the vessel could further breach the hull, allowing water to contact with the thousands of tons of fertilizer, which could then be released into the Red Sea and disrupt the balance of the marine ecosystems, triggering cascading effects throughout the food web.”\nThe US military previously said the attack had significantly damaged the freighter and caused an 18-mile (29km) oil slick.\nThe Houthi attacks have disrupted international trade on the shortest shipping route between Europe and Asia.\nRerouting vessels around the Cape of Good Hope, the Cape Peninsula in South Africa, can add up to two weeks to a shipment’s journey and between 3,000 and 6,000 extra nautical miles (between 5,556 and 11,112km).\nIn response to the attacks on ships, the US and UK began launching strikes against targets in Yemen in January. The US also renamed the Houthis a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) entity.\nThe attacks and counter-attacks have stoked fears that Israel’s war on Gaza could spread, destabilising the wider Middle East.","length":4310,"publishedTime":"2024-03-02T16:48:27Z","rating":[5,7,6,4,8,6,7],"reason":[{"Accuracy":"The article provides a factual account of the sinking of the UK-owned cargo ship, the Rubymar, after being hit by Yemen's Houthis."},{"Objectivity":"The article presents a balanced perspective on the incident, including statements from various sources such as Yemen's government, the Houthis, UK authorities, and environmental experts."},{"Clarity and Coherence":"The article is well-structured, organized, and written in a clear manner that is easy to follow."},{"Depth of Analysis":"The article provides a decent level of analysis regarding the environmental risks, political implications, and impact on international trade caused by the sinking of Rubymar."},{"Language and Presentation":"The language used is appropriate, and the overall presentation is good with no major grammatical errors."},{"Readability":"The article is quite readable, with an understandable language, and coherent paragraphs that aid comprehension."},{"Attractive":"The writing style is engaging and captivating, especially when discussing the implications of the sinkage on the environment and international trade."}],"conclusion":1},{"lang":"en","siteName":"Wallpaper*","link":"https://www.wallpaper.com/fashion-beauty/selahatin-is-a-luxury-oral-care-brand-making-perfume-for-your-mouth","title":"Selahatin is a luxury oral care brand making &lsquo;perfume for your mouth&rsquo;","byline":"Madeleine Rothery","excerpt":"Selahatin was founded on the idea that brushing your teeth should be a pleasurable act of self-care, with perfumed mouthwash, toothpaste, and more","textContent":"Luxury oral hygiene brand Selahatin, was founded after a stroke left Swedish-Turkish designer Kristoffer Vural ‘trapped in [his] own worst nightmare’. Partially paralysed and with a jarring hypersensitivity for taste and smell, he realised ‘that when you’re stripped of everything, it’s the small things that make up 50 per cent of your life. If you can fix the small things, you have a really good baseline.’Brushing his teeth, a seemingly daily mundanity, held the utmost importance for Vural during his rehabilitation. But he felt that the act ‘actually made my day worse’, he recalls. ‘[Toothpaste] tastes so synthetic, so chemical, so strong. It’s got to be the most loveless product with no meaning.’ It was here that Vural saw an opportunity to elevate toothbrushing and dental care to a ritualistic part of self-care, via mindfully flavoured toothpastes, mouthwashes, oral sprays, and elegant accessories to accompany the act.(Image credit: Courtesy of Selahatin)Selahatin makes luxury oral care products to elevate the act of toothbrushingThe brand’s name pays homage to the founder’s Turkish heritage. (It’s his grandfather’s name.) But Vural felt it was also perfectly ‘poetic and clinical’, and also harnessed his personal experience of scent and flavour as a vehicle for memory. ‘I remember that as a kid in Turkey, we would be served cloves after dinner to chew on, cleanse the palette, and feel fresh,’ he reflects. ‘I thought it would be really cool to bridge the two cultures I come from and expand the collective notion of what “fresh” is.’(Image credit: Courtesy of Selahatin)The oral hygiene industry has, for the most part, been dominated by big pharmaceutical companies and bound up in clinical regulations. In launching Selahatin, Vural faced the challenge of convincing developers to work with a boutique brand, which would order a fraction of what competitors were selling and demand niche specifications (like the product being in an aluminium tube, and not plastic).‘I met this team in Switzerland, and the Swiss are really dedicated to craftsmanship,’ he explains. ‘They really got it. With [this team], we were able to create a product that is superior to anything else out there.’ The resulting items produced by Selahatin respond to market regulations, while innovating, both aesthetically and functionally, what oral hygiene can be. Think: sensory palettes and sleek packaging that create a truly pleasurable bookend to the day.(Image credit: Courtesy of Selahatin)The success of Selahatin lies in Vural’s ability to manipulate flavour and aroma as a perfumer does, with a concept and story behind each profile. ‘Everyone is sort of primed to think about the clinical aspects of toothpaste, but no one has really connected to the oral aspect as an experience,’ he says of unique, holistic approach.Take, for example, his toothpaste Hypnotist: the harmonious blend of anise, honey, and peppermint is designed to help calm down the nervous system before bed. Such deeply personal products twist the sterility of oral hygiene into a thoughtful, luxurious act of self-care. ‘These products can have an emotional impact on you,’ he explains of the psychology behind his designs. ‘They can essentially shape your brainwaves and put you in a different state of mind.’(Image credit: Courtesy of Selahatin)Selahatin’s latest collection, Four Seasons, takes this personal approach one step further with a range designed to match the seasons (and the moods that come with it). From a summer profile that embodies the inimitable high brought on by long days and short nights spent on the beach, to a winter flavour that translates the slow, insular nature of the darkened months, the range encourages the consumer to adapt their choice to both their inner and outer landscapes. ‘This ritual becomes an act of meditation because it centres you, and aligns your mind and body,’ says Vural. ‘It makes you more present.’selahatin.com\nReceive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox","length":4063,"publishedTime":"2024-03-06T14:00:10+00:00","rating":[7,8,9,7,9,8,9],"reason":"The article provides a detailed insight into the founding story of luxury oral care brand Selahatin, emphasizing the founder's personal experiences and motivation behind creating the brand.

That looks good,” one student said.You know the saying, if you look good, you feel good? “You don't realize how much a haircut can help a child's self-esteem,” said Wilkerson student community liaison Jean Roberts.When you walk into an elementary school, you’re usually met with laughter from kids, but what about the sound of clippers? At Wilkerson Elementary School, staff has transformed a room into a mini barbershop offering kids haircuts for the unbeatable price of $0. The program is in partnership with local barber Jay Alexander who has been offering free cuts at W.E.B Dubois High School since December 2022 through his program “Thoughts Out Loud,” and now here.“Barbering is my ministry. It's an opportunity for me to speak to people, heal people, help people heal, and also help myself heal as I go through certain things,” said Alexander. Now, he’s using his calling to spark confidence in the future generation.“Something as simple as a haircut can make the world better because you and I are talking,” said Alexander. He's setting up shop at Wilkerson every Wednesday to provide a listening ear and fresh cut.

That looks good,” one student said.\nYou know the saying, if you look good, you feel good? “You don't realize how much a haircut can help a child's self-esteem,” said Wilkerson student community liaison Jean Roberts.When you walk into an elementary school, you’re usually met with laughter from kids, but what about the sound of clippers? At Wilkerson Elementary School, staff has transformed a room into a mini barbershop offering kids haircuts for the unbeatable price of $0. \nThe program is in partnership with local barber Jay Alexander who has been offering free cuts at W.E.B Dubois High School since December 2022 through his program “Thoughts Out Loud,” and now here.\n“Barbering is my ministry. It's an opportunity for me to speak to people, heal people, help people heal, and also help myself heal as I go through certain things,” said Alexander. Now, he’s using his calling to spark confidence in the future generation.“Something as simple as a haircut can make the world better because you and I are talking,” said Alexander. He's setting up shop at Wilkerson every Wednesday to provide a listening ear and fresh cut.

Making sure he gets going is important,\" interim head coach Travis Green said. \"It has been rocky for him at times to find his game. But he's feeling better about himself right now.\"\nIt was the Devils first win under Green. The club is now 1-1-0 since Monday’s coaching change.\n\"Anytime you get a first win with a team is always nice,\" Green said. \"I got a game puck, which is one that I'll keep for sure.\"\n• The Devils’ energy was perhaps the highest it’s been all season. They hustled, were ahead of the play and had a step on the Blues all night. They used their skating as their asset. They won puck races, they were swarming in the offensive zone and St. Louis was chasing all night. That isn’t a surprise with the coaching change, but the team has responded the right way to the change on the bench.\n\"Effort is really just hard work. It makes you skate fast and we want to play a fast game. That takes effort,\" Green said. \n\"It starts with the forecheck, being hard on pucks,\" Meier said. \"Holding onto pucks. Winning those 50-50 (battles). In front of the net as well. We were harder in front of the net and that's how you win games.\"\n• Meier has no doubt been the hottest Devil as of late. And he’s been playing his best hockey of the entire season. He’s been physical, involved and scoring. With his hat trick tonight, he now has six goals in his past four games, which includes a four-game goal streak. He also has a five-game scoring streak with six goals and three assists for nine points.\n• One of the tweaks made by the Devils coaching staff since interim head coach Travis Green took over is putting Meier on the top power-play unit and as the net-front. It’s not a position he’s played a lot of (he was predominantly a flank in San Jose). But he showed great hands in tight from atop the crease to score his opening goal. He corralled the puck in a small window and lifted it on the backhand just over the glove of goaltender Jordan Binnington.\n• The Devils united Ondrej Palat, returning after missing one game with a lower-body injury, with Nico Hischier and Meier. The line combined for seven points with Hischier and Palat each recording two assists.\n\"A good game by the whole line,\" Palat said, \"and the whole team.\"\n• After being a healthy scratch in the previous game, defenseman Simon Nemec drew back in. \n\"I felt pretty good today,\" Nemec said. \"It was just one game. I'm so happy it was just one game.\"\n\"This is not something where I need to see stars, stripes and rainbows,\" Green said. \"I didn't notice him negatively. That's a a good thing.\"\n• It was a nice bounce back effort by goaltender Nico Daws. He was pulled in his last two outings after allowing eight goals on 27 shots total; he surrendered four in each game. He made 23 saves on 24 shots against St. Louis.\n\"He made all the saves he should,\" Green said. \"I really liked his game. Not just the saves he made but his confidence with the puck, playing it.\"\n• The Devils had arguably their best first period of the season. They had a 2-0 lead and 16-5 edge in shots after 20 minutes.\n\"It was important for our group to come out play well right from the start of the game,\" Green said. \"It was a very strong first period.\"\n• Forward Tyler Toffoli was held out of the lineup for trade deadline precautionary reasons.

Instead, the pair who could end up costing Chelsea almost £200m to sign found themselves thrust into the firing line again just three days after the disheartening defeat by Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final.Yet while both had a part to play as Mauricio Pochettino’s side eventually saw off a spirited performance from Leeds, it was left to a player who cost nothing to book their progress into the sixth round. The irony is that Conor Gallagher may have to be sold in the summer to balance the books after an unprecedented spending spree of more than £1bn. On this evidence, they should do all they can to keep him.Pochettino had promised there would be a reaction from his players after their Wembley nightmare, admitting in his programme notes that there was “not much” he could say to his players in the immediate aftermath “because they need to feel the pain before they can move on”.Caicedo came in for heavy criticism for his display against Liverpool, who also wanted to sign him in the summer from Brighton for what turned out to be a British record fee that could rise to £115m. While he was at fault for the opening goal from Mateo Joseph, the Ecuador midfielder did set up Nicolas Jackson for Chelsea’s instant equaliser but is still a shadow of the player who was so sought after last summer. Arsenal, who had made him and Mudryk their primary transfer targets last January, baulked at Brighton’s proposed fee for Caicedo and turned their attentions to signing Declan Rice instead in the summer.Mudryk was reported this week to have been in tears when he called Arsenal after his proposed move to north London failed to materialise when Chelsea entered the race for his signature with a late bid. An initial fee of £60m that could rise to £90m blew Mikel Arteta’s side out of the water and was described at the time as “insane” by the Brentford manager, Thomas Frank. But even if Mudryk showed glimpses of his immense talent before fading having started in a No 10 role here, the feeling of frustration is never too far away either. “He needs time,” Pochettino said of the 23-year-old.This was the first time these two clubs had met in this competition since the famous 1970 final that was eventually settled by David Webb’s goal in extra time of the replay at Old Trafford. But while there remains no love lost between them and Chelsea had won their past six Premier League matches here against Leeds, the travelling supporters arrived in west London with genuine hopes of an upset having gone unbeaten since the end of December.Mykhailo Mudryk is foiled by Leeds goalkeeper Illan Meslier on another frustrating night for the big money signing. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/APMost were in the party mood and greeted Raheem Sterling miscuing his cross straight out of play inside the opening five minutes after a clever pass from Mudryk with howls of derision. The prospect of a famous victory seemed even more possible when Joseph, who was born in Spain and is a second cousin of the former England striker Emile Heskey, capitalised on a mix‑up between Axel Disasi and Caicedo as Chelsea attempted to play out of defence.To Pochettino’s relief, they hit back immediately and an excellent piece of interplay between Caicedo and Noni Madueke provided Jackson with the chance to equalise. Some Chelsea fans greeted that goal with a muted chorus of “We’ve won it all”, while one brandished a banner referencing their comeback win against Crystal Palace a few weeks ago that read “Don’t worry about a thing”.That peace of mind has not seemed possible for Mudryk since his high-profile move to Stamford Bridge last January but there is nothing like scoring goals to give a player confidence. Having been targeted by the away fans minutes earlier when he went over to take a corner, he took great joy celebrating in front of them when he swept home Sterling’s cross with a brilliant first-time finish.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionPochettino certainly seemed to appreciate his efforts, encouragingly patting his forward on the backside after he managed to keep a ball from going out of play right in front of the dugouts.Caicedo’s rash booking for a reckless challenge on Joseph three minutes into the second half – his ninth of the season – hinted that Chelsea were in for a scrap after the break. And so it proved when Jaidon Anthony picked out Joseph to equalise deservedly after a period of concerted pressure from the hosts.Having failed to have much more of an impact on proceedings, Mudryk might have thought his evening was over when he miscontrolled the ball out of play off his shin but instead Pochettino opted to withdraw Sterling to a chorus of boos from the home supporters for the second game in succession. In the end, it was Gallagher who saved Chelsea’s blushes.","length":5025,"publishedTime":"2024-02-28T23:31:10.000Z","rating":[5,7,6,4,7,6,6],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the events surrounding Moisés Caicedo, Mykhailo Mudryk, and Conor Gallagher in relation to Chelsea and their recent matches.

Most vertebrates, like birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, reproduce by laying eggs filled with nourishing yolk that their offspring use as an initial source of nutrition before hatching. Mammals change the game by giving birth to live young and feeding them fatty, sugary milk as they get on their feet.But nature breaks rules all the time, and the latest animals to confound the yolk vs. milk binary are caecilians, the egg-laying, legless amphibians that look like worms. Research published Thursday in the journal Science suggests they feed their hatchlings a milk-like substance too, but from their behinds. This behavior is unknown in amphibians.It adds to the curiousness of caecilians, who were already known for feeding hatchlings skin ripped off mom’s back as a postnatal nutritious snack.“It’s like they’re from another planet,” said Carlos Jared, a caecilian researcher at the Butantan Institute in São Paulo, Brazil, and an author of the study. “For me, they’re like Martians.”Caecilians are “one of the least understood” vertebrates, Dr. Jared said. Because they spend most of their lives underground, they are difficult to find and even harder to study.Since 1987, his team has been musing about caecilians making milk. After several trips to the cacao plantations in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, his team managed to collect 16 mothers of the Siphonops annulatus species of caecilians, and their numerous hatchlings. Each mother has four to 13 babies. Back in the lab, they filmed each family during the two months from hatching until the wormy amphibians became independent.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

When the Chancellor finished his statement in the Commons, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) published updated forecasts for the UK’s economic and fiscal outlook. The OBR is the independent public finances watchdog, which produces the official forecasts for the economy and public finances used by the Chancellor.\nThe Chancellor has cut the main rate of National Insurance contributions (NICs) for employees and the self-employed by 2 percentage points. The cost is being met through a mixture of other tax increases, higher government borrowing and improvements in the underlying forecast for borrowing.\nThe underlying forecast for government borrowing has improved largely because lower inflation and interest rates reduce the Government’s debt servicing and welfare costs, by more than they reduce revenues.\nThe Chancellor said he was presenting a “Budget for long term growth” which would deliver “more investment, more jobs, better public services and lower taxes.” \nNational Insurance – the main rate of Class 1 employee NICs will be cut from 10% to 8% from April 2024; the main rate of Class 4 employee NICs will be cut from 8% to 6% from April 2024. This is in addition to the 1% cut announced in the 2023 Autumn Statement, which also comes into effect in April 2024. \nThe High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC) – the threshold HICHB will be raised from £50,000 to £60,000 from April 2024. In addition, the rate at which this is charged will be halved so that Child Benefit is not withdrawn in full until individuals earn £80,000 or more, rather than £60,000. Currently, the HICBC provides for Child Benefit to be clawed back through the tax system for families where the highest earner has an income in excess of £50,000. The Child Benefit payment is withdrawn completely when their income reaches £60,000.\nThe taxation of non-doms – the tax regime for non-UK domiciled individuals (‘non-doms’) where people whose permanent home (domicile) is outside the UK may not have to pay UK tax on foreign income, will be abolished. It will be replaced, from April 2025, by a new residence-based regime, where all UK residents who stay in the UK for over four years will pay the same tax on their foreign income and gains, regardless of their domicile status.\nCapital Gains Tax – the higher rate of Capital Gains Tax for residential property disposals will be cut from 28% to 24% from April 2024.\nStamp Duty Land Tax – from 1 June 2024, the Government will abolish Multiple Dwellings Relief, a tax relief in the Stamp Duty Land Tax regime for people and businesses buying multiple properties in a single transaction (or multiple linked transactions).\nFurnished holiday lettings – from 6 April 2025, the Government will abolish a tax advantage for landlords who let short-term furnished holiday properties over those who let residential properties to longer-term tenants.\nFuel duty – will be frozen for another year by extending the temporary 5p cut and not uprating duty rates with inflation. Fuel duties have not risen since January 2011.\nAlcohol duty – will be frozen from 1 August 2024 until 1 February 2025. This extends the six-month freeze announced in the 2023 Autumn Statement.\nTobacco and vaping duties – a new duty on vaping products will be introduced from October 2026. Tobacco duty will also be increased from October 2026. This is to maintain the current financial incentive to choose vaping over smoking. \nAir passenger duty – rates for premium economy class passengers, business and first class passengers, and for private jet passengers will be increased by more than forecast inflation from 2025/26 to account for recent high inflation. The duty rates would otherwise be increase by inflation.\nVAT threshold – the VAT threshold will be increased from £85,000 to £90,000 in April 2024.\nEnergy profits levy – the levy, introduced in May 2022 in response to the rise in oil and gas company profits, will be extended by a year to 2028/29. \nHousehold Support Fund – the Household Support Fund allows local authorities in England to make discretionary payments to people most in need to help towards the rising cost of food, energy, and water bills. It has been extended by six months to September 2024 – it was due to end in March 2024. \nThe OBR forecasts that the economy will grow a little faster in 2024 and 2025 than it forecast in November 2023, although growth was weaker than previously expected at the end of 2023. Inflation and interest rates are now forecast to fall more quickly than previously expected.\nThe OBR forecasts that government borrowing will fall from £114 billion in 2023/24 to £87 billion in 2024/25. Borrowing is then forecast to fall in each financial year before it gets to £39 billion in 2028/29, which is the final year of the OBR’s current forecast period. As the chart below shows, a similar pattern is seen for borrowing as a percentage of GDP. \nThe government’s underlying debt was equivalent to 84.9% of GDP at the end of 2022/23. The OBR forecasts that it will increase each year before reaching 93.2% of GDP in 2027/28. It will then fall to 92.9% of GDP in 2028/29.\nThe OBR’s forecast for underlying debt is largely unchanged from November 2023, as the chart below shows. \nFurther information summarising the OBR’s economic and fiscal forecasts are provided in the full Library briefing.\nFor a quick explainer on the Budget, see our Insight: What is the Budget?\nFind all of the Library’s research on the 2024 Spring Budget in one place.","length":5824,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[6,7,8,6,7,7,6],"reason":"The article provides a comprehensive summary of the 2024 Spring Budget presented by Chancellor Jeremy Hunt.

The edible bounty is noteworthy, but the valley is best known for its tens of millions of tulips covering the valley every spring.\nThe blooms can be viewed and celebrated during the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival, which is considered to be the largest tulip festival in the U.S. This year, the festival’s 41st, will feature a parade, art shows, a downtown street fair, and more — all set to a colorful, blooming backdrop.\nWhile the festival typically kicks off on April 1 and wraps up on April 30, the exact dates depend on the bloom, which is monitored in great detail here. \n“The Skagit Valley is perfectly situated for the cultivation of hearty, vibrant tulips,” Nicole Roozen, executive director of the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival, said in a press release shared with Travel + Leisure. “Each year visitors flock to the Skagit Valley to behold row upon row of delightfully color-coordinated tulips. The Skagit Valley Tulip Festival is a celebration of the bloom and the endless beauty of the Pacific Northwest.”\nSkagit Valley sits between Seattle and the U.S.-Canadian border in Washington’s northwestern corner. The valley is just over one hour by car from Seattle and 1.5 hours from Vancouver. To the west of the valley, there are 60 miles of coastline, including the San Juan Islands.\nThe endless sea of color that takes over Skagit Valley in April can be seen up close at the valley’s many tulip farms or gardens. According to the festival, the flower market RoozenGaarde has over 200 varieties of tulips and daffodils showcased on 50 acres of land.\nThe smaller Tulip Town has over 55 tulip varieties along with a beer and wine garden. You can also pick your own tulip bouquet and take a free farm tour at Tulip Valley Farms, which also hosts a laser- and light-laden “NightBloom” on Friday and Saturday nights during the festival. \nIn addition to visiting the various tulip fields around Skagit Valley, there will be a Tulip Parade in La Conner, Washington on April 6, and a street fair in downtown Mount Vernon, Washington with over 140 vendors from April 19 through April 21. There will also be the chance to see the ins and outs of semi-truck development (a key mode of transportation in agriculture) and a pickleball tournament from April 25 through April 28.\nEvery Friday and Saturday during the festival tulip lovers can enjoy “Tea and Tulips” at Willowbrook Manor, an English-style tea house and farm stay.","length":3055,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,8,6,9,8,8],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival, detailing the location, events, and attractions accurately.

One by one, other countries seen as immune to extremism saw far-right parties enter parliament: The Alternative for Germany party won its first parliamentary seats in 2017; two years later, Spain’s Vox party followed suit. Those parties joined well-established ones in Austria, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and elsewhere, quickly cementing their place in their countries’ political landscapes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\tAs far-right parties gained momentum across Europe, Portugal long stood out as an exception. One by one, other countries seen as immune to extremism saw far-right parties enter parliament: The Alternative for Germany party won its first parliamentary seats in 2017; two years later, Spain’s Vox party followed suit. Those parties joined well-established ones in Austria, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and elsewhere, quickly cementing their place in their countries’ political landscapes.\nIn Portugal, however, a smattering of small far-right parties had tried but failed to win serious influence over the five decades since the 1974 revolution that toppled the country’s dictatorship. When Chega, a far-right party led by the charismatic André Ventura, came onto the scene in 2019, it looked likely to face the same headwinds as its predecessors.\nBut the campaign dynamics ahead of the March 10 snap legislative election are proof that the political scene is changing in this country of 10 million. According to recent polling, Chega (“Enough”) could take almost 20 percent of the vote. With the center-left Socialists and center-right Social Democrats running neck and neck for first place, Chega may well end up being the kingmaker for the next government if, as expected, neither mainstream party gains enough seats to form a majority. The results will serve as the latest data point in the far right’s ascent across the continent ahead of European Parliament elections in June.\nVentura, a 41-year-old former TV soccer commentator running on the message of “Portugal needs a clean-up,” has been spurred on by a perfect storm of factors, including the corruption-related resignation of Prime Minister António Costa late last year, rising frustration with the political system, and a rightward shift among young voters. A wide-ranging corruption probe into members of Costa’s Socialist government triggered this month’s vote and propelled newfound support for Chega.\nAs a result, when it comes to the far right, Portugal is no longer the outlier. In fact, it was never really immune to far-right politics, experts say—it just hadn’t had the right moment or the right leader to capitalize on them.\nThat said, since the 1974 revolution, a confluence of historical factors has helped limit the far right’s ability to gain traction in Portugal. One of these was the nature of the revolution itself, which was a reaction to a conservative dictatorship. Led in large part by left-leaning movements, the revolution prevented “anything to the right of the mainstream right from emerging for a very long time,” said Luca Manucci, a political science researcher at the University of Lisbon. “But it’s not that these parties didn’t exist.”\nPortugal’s long history of immigration from its former colonies, such as Brazil, Cape Verde, and Angola, also meant that immigration has been less divisive here than in many other European countries. “Immigration is not politicized in Portugal almost at all,” said Lea Heyne, who researches Portugal’s far right alongside Manucci. “This has limited Chega to some degree in the way that they can act as other populist radical right parties act in other countries.”\nFive years ago, Chega barely made a dent on the national level. In the 2019 elections, the newly founded party won just 1.3 percent of the vote and a single constituency in parliament: Ventura’s, located just outside Lisbon. It may not have been a strong showing, but it was a historic first and gave Ventura a springboard to get into the political spotlight.\nVentura has all the right characteristics to draw in voters. As António Costa Pinto, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon’s Institute of Social Sciences, put it, “Ventura is the party.”\nVentura came from the center-right Social Democratic Party (PSD), which gives him the veneer of respectability needed to win over a broader range of voters. He broke from PSD in 2018 after an unsuccessful 2017 mayoral campaign near Lisbon, during which he espoused harshly anti-Roma rhetoric, a message he has built on as a member of parliament. Ventura refers to Portugal’s Roma population, which has been in the country for centuries, as “criminal,” arguing they disproportionately rely on government benefits.\nVentura has also built up a persona based on his willingness to say things other politicians won’t. “He introduced a new type of political speech, an anti-elitist political speech—the typical populist radical right recipe,” Pinto said. On top of that, Ventura’s role as a professional soccer commentator made him well known across the country. “The moment he created Chega, all the cameras were pointed at him,” Manucci said.\nIn the 2022 election, Chega drew increased attention on the national stage as it won 12 seats and 7.2 percent of the vote. Since then, Ventura has been able to tap into a swath of voters dissatisfied with the Portuguese political system, including young people and many who had previously not voted.\nA more recent wave of migration—the number of people of foreign origin living in Portugal rose for the seventh consecutive year in 2022—has also allowed Ventura and Chega to begin instrumentalizing an issue that long played a minor role in Portuguese politics. Ventura has advocated harsher penalties for illegal immigration, saying it “destroys Europe,” and called for “the drastic reduction of the Islamic presence in the European Union.”\nChega has also pledged to “put an end to corruption” among Portugal’s political elite—a slogan found on its campaign posters plastered around Lisbon. This message resonates with voters in an election where corruption plays a central role. Costa, the prime minister, resigned last November after police arrested his chief of staff and raided his residence and government buildings in relation to alleged influence-peddling surrounding Portugal’s lithium mining industry. (Costa himself has not been accused of wrongdoing.) Another former Socialist prime minister, José Sócrates, will stand trial for a separate corruption scandal.\n“When a party tells everybody that the elites are corrupt, and then the elites are corrupt, this can only play into the hands of the far right,” Manucci said.\nVentura clearly sees himself as part of an international far-right movement. After Javier Milei won Argentina’s presidential election in November 2023, Ventura posted on X, formerly Twitter: “The fight to defend society is taking place in several territories and in Argentina the first battle has been won!” Recently, he told the Financial Times that he considers Italian far-right leader Matteo Salvini “a very good friend” and that he has “a great relation” with Dutch politician Geert Wilders, whose far-right Party for Freedom came in first in the Netherlands’ November parliamentary elections. “I believe we are united,” Ventura said. “We are strong.”\nPortugal is part of “the unfortunate pattern of the far right growing everywhere,” said Daphne Halikiopoulou, a comparative politics professor at the University of York who focuses on far-right parties. With European Parliament elections on the horizon, major gains for the country’s far right—combined with growing momentum for similar parties across the continent—will be seen as a bellwether for political trends across the continent, spurred on by anti-immigrant sentiment, anti-establishment populism, and cost of living crises.\nNot only are these parties growing in many countries, Halikiopoulou said, but they are also becoming increasingly normalized. In Europe, the far right is in power in Hungary and Italy; it has joined governing coalitions in Finland and previously in Austria; and it has informally supported governments across the continent, such as in Sweden, where the far-right Sweden Democrats are not officially part of the governing coalition with the center-right Moderate Party but support its legislation.\nThat normalization gives people who are sympathetic to far-right policies moral and political cover to vote for them. “A lot of people who had certain attitudes and didn’t want to be stigmatized—now they’re free,” Halikiopoulou said.","length":8656,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T13:54:48-05:00","rating":[6,7,8,7,8,7,7],"reason":[{"Accuracy":"The article provides a detailed and accurate account of the rise of far-right politics in Portugal, citing specific examples and historical context to support its claims."},{"Objectivity":"The article presents a balanced perspective, discussing both the factors contributing to the rise of the far right and the historical limitations that have influenced Portuguese politics.

John Mayer was also announced with a new \"Creative Conduit\" title for Audemars Piguet.\n\tThose are the highlights. It is a beautiful imagination of AP's past and future all in one watch and endlessly captivating. Within the announcement, there were also a lot of other little pieces of news and things to talk about regarding design, the brand's history, and John Mayer's collecting path. One-on-one, Mayer and I spoke a bit about how the Royal Oak, or more specifically the RO QP, has become – I would argue – one of the most emblematic watches of his collection (or even persona). There are some insights to share, but no quotes. I figure that when Mayer wants to speak for himself, he will do so with the passion and knowledge we have come to expect from him. But if you'll pardon me, I want to talk about music and divert from the topic at hand for a bit to set the stage.\n\tA little over a week ago, I was driving back from a trip outside New York. As I tuned in to John Mayer's new Sirius XM station, I got to the channel just in time to hear him talk about his favorite song, \"Gentle On My Mind\" by John Hartford, made famous by Glen Campbell.\n\tHartford once described the song as a \"word movie,\" describing a drifter and his lost love. Glen Campbell called it an \"essay on life\" and said that he was \"knocked out\" by the picture it paints. As Mayer explained on the radio, that beautiful turn of phrase – \"gentle on my mind\" – describes a perfect kind of love. It's a love, a yearning, but that doesn't hurt when you can't be together or don't even have it anymore; it's a love that's a comfort knowing that it's out there somewhere. It's good just to know it exists.\n\tTo take something so eloquently stated about love between two people and prescribe it to watches feels a bit extreme, even for someone who obsesses over these things. Watch lovers are passionate people in our own (sometimes odd) way, so I have to admit, the song also rings more than a little true for how I've felt about the Royal Oak perpetual calendars, both vintage and modern.\n\tFor years, I've considered Royal Oaks the pinnacle of modern perpetual calendar design, wedding avant-garde-turned-icon Genta design with a beautifully legible display and wonderful horological lineage (and we'll get to all that, I promise). They're also often the final tier in a collecting journey with Audemars Piguet (save for Grande Complications that few people know exist, and now, the Code 11.59 RD#4). The fact that I can't begin to imagine affording one – retail or not – has allowed me to appreciate their releases in person and from afar, and I long for one knowing where each of us – the watch and I – stood. Sure, it was nice to imagine, but it was an \"arms-length\" flirtation.\n An AP Grande Complication Royal Oak spotted in Dubai, only the second one I'd seen in the wild.\n\tI'm unsure yet how gently this watch will weigh on my mind. I've come to terms with the fact that this it isn't in my budget, or maybe my next 20 years' budget, but while most other QPs were covetable and enviable but a slow burn, this is something else. This is a culmination of not only Mayer's passion for watches and Audemars Piguet specifically, but it will be a memorable moment for me in my watch journey. I picked up a guitar in middle school because of three people: my uncle, James Taylor, and John Mayer. In fact, I still hunt for Mayer's original Martin signature guitar the way some people hunt for the watch they found cool when they were kids. And when I got back into watches – the hobby my grandfather started me in – it was in no small part due to Ben, John, and all of Hodinkee. Now, on the back of Ben's first-ever limited edition watch, comes a masterpiece encapsulating both a brand's history and the collector community's wishes.\n\tThe night his watch was released to the press, John and I chatted a lot about his history with AP. For me, the first moment the AP Royal Oak QP \"clicked\" was seeing a rose gold, blue dial version (ref. 26574OR) on his wrist in 2016 or so. It seems that was the moment it clicked for him, too. He got one of the first hundred; his was numbered and he picked it up himself from the boutique in New York like anyone else.\n Three different Royal Oak QPs from Ben's coverage of the updated 41mm model lineup in 2015, including the 26574OR on the left. I'd argue that instead of the gold, green dial Daytona, this was is the true \"John Mayer\" – until today, that is.\n\tIt wasn't his first foray into AP. He reminded me he wore a 15202 in our \"Watch I Wore The Most\" recap in 2014. But with any of his passions, he went deep fast. By 2016, he shared the Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Concept GMT Tourbillon as his \"Watch I Wore The Most.\" It showed up on the stage with Dead & Co., but those not in the know probably didn't think it was a luxury watch – a perfect choice.\n\tIn 2017, AP reset the bar with the black ceramic Royal Oak QP, and John told me that's when he realized that AP was in a new golden era. It was peak Audemars Piguet, doing something you didn't believe they could do, but of course, they do it time and time again. People get so hung up on the case shape but don't look past that to see what's inside. Then there was the RD#1, which turned into the Royal Oak Supersonnerie (which Mayer was spotted wearing – a musician and a musical watch is a match made in heaven), and on and on.\n\tAs time went on and his passion grew, Mayer moved from friend of the brand to ambassador to his new official title of \"Creative Conduit.\" He describes the new role as acting as a bridge between collectors and the brand – someone who has his foot in both worlds, maintaining his status as a client (actually buying the watches he wants) while having close connections inside the company. It allows him to tell the story of the watches he's passionate about (and informed about) to the collector community while returning their feedback to the brand as someone who is still a client himself.\n\tIt's no surprise that, through the journey, the time eventually came for Mayer to design his version of the ultimate Royal Oak perpetual calendar. We've seen a pièce unique Royal Oak QP from Ed Sheeran, and Travis Scott released his fascinating, creative (and divisive) Royal Oak QP last fall. Both are super cool watches, but they're far more intense. They're not watches that weigh \"gently,\" to go back to the John Hartford reference. But this watch just hits different; it's not bold or brash – it was designed with a soft touch to feel it always could have been in the collection. It's distinctly \"John Mayer's watch,\" but doesn't have his name anywhere on it – the name is \"in collaboration with John Mayer,\" unlike the \"Cactus Jack\" model, after all, speaking to a different kind of experience John has with the brand.\n\tAt some point, after Mayer delivered his proposed pièce unique design to François-Henry Bennahmias (then-CEO of AP), Bennahmias turned around with a different proposal: why not make the watch as a limited edition instead? It was the perfect option in many ways, one where the idea originated without having the pressure of second-guessing yourself because of the anxiety of knowing something would be out in the world. It was still the watch he most wanted – a perpetual calendar Royal Oak where the dial was a cosmic array of facets that played with the light, and you could enjoy it for hours – but it would just live differently now.\n\tThe watch is the same, at its core, as other Royal Oak QPs of recent years. The 18k white gold case measures a comfortable 41mm by 9.5mm thick and is water-resistant to 20 meters, with a display caseback. The watch has all the QP functions you'd need (and maybe one I personally don't: the week indicator). The Caliber 5134 movement has only 40 hours of power reserve, but you'd want this on a watch winder anyway – I'm sure you don't want to set the watch. The watch is also numbered on the back. But all that pales in comparison to the creativity of the dial.\n\tThe connection between the new watch and the Tuscan dials of AP's past jumped out at me immediately. As music fans would like to say, those watches are kind of a deep cut. The term \"Tuscan\" for the hand-hammered dials found on rare Royal Oaks (and a few other watches, almost all QPs) wasn't something ever officially mentioned in AP's internal communications. It was a nickname made, rumor has it, by (who else but) Italian collectors who were reminded of the night sky in Tuscany. Unfortunately, that early hand-hammering doesn't always look the best – it can tend to have a plasticky visual texture. When AP revived the dial last year, they yet again didn't mention \"Tuscan\" in the press material – a fact that drew a smirk from an executive when I mentioned it this week – but with better manufacturing techniques, I thought they nearly perfected it. It was an \"if you know, you know\" release and a nod to the true lovers of the brand's history.\n\tOne of my favorite features of any modern RO QP reference has always been the aventurine moonphase with the photorealistic moon made with an image from NASA. I've told people countless times that if I owned that watch, I would hold it to my face and stare at the \"stars\" of the Aventurine for hours at a time. The Code 11.59 QP with aventurine dial took that idea and turned it up to 11 in a way that maybe was too much of a good thing.\n With the Code 11.59 dial made fully of aventurine, it makes it hard to appreciate the beauty of the sky in the moonphase. It's great, for sure, but it's not really the same experience as the Royal Oak moonphase.\n This version keeps the interesting dial texture while still letting the moonphase sing.\n\tThe new Crystal Sky dial is the best of both worlds and more: a dial designed by someone who took a lot of time to look at everything AP has done in the past and might do in the future and tried to land squarely in the middle. It's a new motif for AP. The brass dial plate is stamped by an electroformed die, which allows precision by building up the reverse of the intended dial design atom by atom, giving a high accuracy and fine detail to the end result. Then, the dial is PVD-coated in a deep blue shade.\n\tIn certain light, the effect is similar to the original Tuscan dial QPs, where subdials are brighter, more eye-catching, and stand out with their guilloché, increasing legibility while the dial fades to dark blue with specs of light dancing around. In more direct light, the watch shifts incredibly as it moves. You could spend days looking at the watch, which will look different each time. The electro-formed stamping has created almost a crystalline structure that looks like the inside of an amethyst geode. There are other little touches, like the \"31\" date being offset on two levels instead of colored red like most RO QPs, separating it visually from the 1 for the start of the month. The hand indicating the week is a light blue, allowing it to fade from view until the rare occasion it's needed. It was all from Mayer's mind, trying to simplify and distill the watch down to the most elegant form.\n\tThere's also the fact that this is the swan song for one of the most important calibers in Audemars Piguet's history, the caliber 2120/2800. Specifically, this is the last time we'll see the Calibre 5134, the brand's extra-thin perpetual calendar movement that was introduced back in 2015 and is based off the same legendary 2120 architecture Audemars Piguet first delivered in 1967. The 2120 was developed with Jaeger-LeCoultre, Vacheron Constantin, and Patek Philippe to create a reliable ultra-thin movement. It was an era in which all brands worked closely together (often as each other's customers), and after the Calibre 2120 appeared in the Royal Oak, it would take its place in the Nautilus in 1976 and in Vacheron's Overseas in 1977.\n\tThat caliber's longevity is remarkable and probably deserves its own story, but over the ensuing 18 years, the AP would make 7,000 watches with the caliber. The watch paved the way for AP's open-worked chronograph in 1980, the first self-winding tourbillon wristwatch in 1986, the minute repeater in 1992, and the Grande Complication in 1996. But maybe most importantly, in 1984, the 2120/2800 powered the first Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar, ref. 5554, the thinnest Royal Oak perpetual calendar until the RD#2, measuring only 7.5mm. Over 57 years, AP still found ways to improve the movement, but now it's time to let it go. Saying goodbye to something like that is both emotional and, I could tell for Mayer, an honor. From my perspective, all I can say is that it's a fitting send-off.\n\tNow, after a long journey, Mayer has officially left his mark in the annals of AP history with the last Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar of its kind, and it's a beautiful tribute to history. It's the way I could have imagined AP imagining the next step in their own evolution – modern, more than a little eye-catching, and yet more thoughtful than I could have ever put together.\n\tI'd imagine seeing the watch in the world is a very personal experience for him, though it's one Mayer and any artist know well. Whether it is a watch, drawing, design, or song, after untold hours, days, or, in this case, years agonizing over this manifestation of yourself, watching it evolve and change, you inevitably have to decide. As a professor once told me, you can take your art and put it in a shoebox under the bed, content with knowing that it exists only for yourself to look at once in a while. Or you can take the leap and put your art out in the world where it's no longer \"yours\" and becomes something else, something that you can't control, and something that will outlive you. I'm glad AP and John Mayer chose the latter. And as time passes, I think the watch will start to weigh more and more gently on me.\n\tAudemars Piguet Royal Oak Perpetual Calendar in collaboration with John Mayer, ref. 26574BC; 41mm diameter by 9.5mm thick 18k white gold case, with 20m water resistance.

The first is keeping the source film out of sight.Although released in cinemas in 2023 to high praise, Krishnadev Yagnik’s psychological thriller isn’t available on a streamer yet as part of the remake deal. This not only makes it difficult to compare the original and the Hindi reboot, but also puts viewers in the difficult position of giving Shaitaan’s director Vikas Bahl credit that may not be due to him.Bahl’s recent track record – the web series Good Bad Girl and Sunflower, the movies Goodbye and Ganpat – has been spotty. He has a proven discomfort with coherence and judicious pacing. However, Shaitaan is a mostly smooth chronicle of occult practices severely disrupting domestic equilibrium. Krishnadev Yagnik has a story credit, and is an invisible but palpable presence throughout Shaitaan’s many highs and occasional lows.Kabir (Ajay Devgn), his wife Jyoti (Jyotika), daughter Jhanvi (Janki Bodiwala) and son Dhruv (Anngad Raaj) check into their holiday home in Dehradun for a vacation.

Courtesy Panorama Studios/Jio Studios/Devgn Films.Except for a sagging middle portion, Shaitaan is nerve-shredding stuff, especially when Vanraj is in full-blown diabolical pied piper mode. Apart from being a perfectly serviceable movie about a black magic practitioner at work, Shaitaan is also a cautionary tale about domineering men seeking to control young, impressionable women. Vanraj isn’t just a malevolent warlock but an extreme version of your average patriarch.The basic premise is meaty in itself to allow for suspension of disbelief. The loopholes are kept out of view for the most part, but nevertheless reveal themselves. The ending, which has been lifted from a feted Argentinean movie, undermines the movie’s overall impact.The curious inertness of Jhanvi’s parents is an underexplored, unsatisfactory element. Shaitaan goes some way towards explaining Vanraj’s sickening grand plan. But the parents, despite strong performances by Devgn and Jyotika, are not always credible as witnesses rooted to the spot, unable to prevent a tragedy unfolding right before their eyes.Anngad Raaj is wonderful as the smart and sensitive Dhruv. Janki Bodiwala, reprising the role she played in Vash, is the most compelling performer. Bodiwala memorably conveys Jhanvi’s anguish at obeying Vanraj’s demented demands while trying to hold on to her true self. As Vanraj, the aptly cast R Madhavan is smug, sadistic and sinister in equal measure.","length":2868,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T09:15:00+05:30","rating":[6,5,7,6,8,6,7],"reason":"The article provides detailed information about the film 'Shaitaan' and its components, discussing the plot, characters, performances, and themes.

Lower-48 gas production last week hit a new high of 96.4 Bcf/d, after surpassing 95 Bcf/d not too long ago (in late October). That’s remarkable considering that production was only 52 Bcf/d just 12 years ago.

As we wrote in our I’m Tore Down blog two months ago, daily Henry Hub prompt futures settles from April through September 2019 (black line in Figure 1) averaged $2.41/MMBtu, the lowest seasonal average since the late 1990s, according to CME/NYMEX data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). That trend continued in October, when prompt futures averaged $2.33, again at a two-decade low. Prices rallied somewhat earlier in November to as high as $2.862/MMBtu, as the market took a cue from what were at the time bullish, much-colder-than-normal weather predictions for late November and early December.\nBut those expectations have since fizzled, as weather didn’t materialize quite as expected and the near-term weather outlook has moderated considerably. The December 2019 contract expired on November 26 at $2.47/MMBtu, 25 cents, or 9%, lower than where it had been at the beginning of November. The January 2019 contract settled just above $2.50 on its first day at the front of the curve, on November 27, but then proceeded to post the biggest single-day loss since late January 2019, settling 22 cents lower at $2.281/MMBtu on November 29 (black line in dashed red oval). Not only is that a far cry from last year’s November-traded average of $4.05 and more than $1 below the November 2018 low point (dark-blue line in dashed red oval), but it’s the lowest settlement in the month of November since 2015 (yellow line in dashed red oval).","length":2421,"publishedTime":"2019-12-02T20:00:00-06:00","rating":[5,7,6,5,8,6,6],"reason":"The article provides a factual account of the current state of U.S. natural gas production and prices, including historical data and recent trends.

March  07, 2024","excerpt":"Internal talent marketplaces can help establish transparency and fairness around the process of internal career-shifts into desirable technical roles.","textContent":"The ongoing tech talent shortage is driving organizations to establish internal talent marketplaces, which can be used to improve transparency within the business and help uncover employee talents.\nAs part of the technology stack, an internal talent marketplace functions as a tool to help individuals looking for a new role or new opportunities within the organization.\nThe key stakeholders involved in developing such a marketplace include HR professionals, technology and data analytics teams, leadership, and employees themselves.\"A successful talent marketplace provide the steps to getting there and to figuring out if they have the skills and competencies for that role, and if not, what they need to do to get from point A to point B,\" explains Hannah Johnson, senior vice president and head of tech talent programs at CompTIA.\nShe says HR professionals play a critical role in designing the marketplace, ensuring compliance, and aligning it with the company's talent strategy.\nTechnology and data analytics teams are essential for implementing a software platform and AI-driven matching algorithms.\nLeadership support is also critical to fostering a culture that values internal mobility, allocating resources to support the marketplace.\nEmployees are key stakeholders, as their engagement and participation are critical to the success of the marketplace—all must work together to ensure the marketplace meets the needs of the organization and its employees.\n\"Make sure you have employees who are on board with the idea and can help to make sure that it's getting built out to the way leadership and the HR team originally envisioned it,\" Johnson says. \"Employees should be testing it as they go to ensure it is accomplishing what they want it to accomplish.\"\nIdeally, there should be a dedicated project team to develop and maintain such a talent marketplace portal.\nJason Wodicka, principal developer advocate at Karat, says an effective strategy for internal mobility, like an internal talent platform, can fill roles with people who already have organizational context from elsewhere in the business.\n\"This promotes the sharing of context and ideas across the business,\" Wodicka says. \"It also helps avoid the loss of institutional knowledge associated with skilled employees leaving to find career advancement elsewhere in the industry.\"\nThey explain in addition to the obvious stakeholders in HR and recruiting teams, an often-overlooked key stakeholder is hiring managers across the organization.\n\"To make internal mobility work effectively and fairly, hiring managers need to get specific in what skills they need, and be willing to accept candidates entering from elsewhere in the business,\" Wodicka advises. \"This often means being willing to accept nontraditional backgrounds for roles.\"\nMike Walters, President and co-founder of Action1, says these marketplaces can make it easier for talent to move within the organization, leading to better utilization of skills, increased job satisfaction, and enhanced career development.\n\"This can have a significant impact because people can change their job preferences over time, and it can help retain skilled employees,\" he explains.\nFor example, an experienced technical support engineer may advance his career by applying for a system administration or information security path because he might be very interested in such career opportunities.\nAn internal talent marketplace can also contribute to a culture of employee-driven career advancement and internal transfers within an organization.\n\"It can give employees a sense of control and opportunity despite the broader organizational changes,\" Walters says. \"It can signal to employees that the company values their skills and growth, boosting morale and engagement during challenging times—and retain truly skilled employees for the company.\"\nJohnson points out many organizations now offer some type of professional development or learning and development, but very often employees get overwhelmed by those offerings.\n\"They're fantastic, but unless you have a very specific skill set that you're looking to gain or is relevant to your position, you can get kind of lost in the offerings,\" she says. \"These talent marketplaces provide clear paths to where you want to be, and how you get there.\"\nFrom her perspective, individual employees are likely to be more incentivized in completing something specific to them and achieving their goals than a broad offering.\n\"With more time and more people adopting them and more feedback, they're going to get even better,\" Johnson says.\nIn addition, AI-driven platforms can play a role facilitating more efficient and cost-effective internal talent mobility by matching employees to suitable roles within an organization.\n\"AI can analyze vast amounts of data, including skills, experience, and career aspirations, to make personalized job recommendations, improving the speed and accuracy of matching employees to roles that match their skills and interests,\" Walters says. \"It can also give an employee the chance to try something new in their career path.\"\nThis opens new opportunities for employees and a new job that they may enjoy more than the previous one.\nFor example, for a system administrator, AI can offer multiple paths to advancement depending on their skills and desires, such as moving to a DevOps role or becoming an IT architect.\n\"This can also encourage people to move into IT or other career paths from completely different fields, but with the necessary soft skills and willingness to learn,\" he adds.\nFrom his perspective, organizations must create more transparent and accessible internal job market.\n\"This allows the company to identify and develop talent from within, filling skill gaps with existing employees rather than seeking external hires,\" Walters says.\nBy offering employees more opportunities for career growth and skill development, companies can improve employee satisfaction, increase retention, and build a more agile and skilled workforce.","length":6133,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T12:15:53-06:00","rating":[8,7,9,8,8,7,8],"reason":"The article provides a comprehensive overview of building an internal talent marketplace,

A great deal of that was down to one man, as while Jose Mourinho was a black hole of negativity, an emotional vortex sucking the joy out of the sport on the touchline, Daniele De Rossi shows what the Roma spirit really is.Video OneFootballCan you imagine if Mou had been on that bench, would his team have come out fighting like that from the very start, pinning Inter back and forcing the runaway league leaders on the defensive? Even less likely is having the self-appointed Special One using the kind of words that De Rossi did both before and after this match. That is where the true difference lies and why sacking Mourinho was the best decision the Friedkins could’ve made.In the build-up, De Rossi focused not on how decimated his own squad was, on how very strong the opposition seemed, on the practical impossibility of the task they were faced with. Instead, he assured that “every team is beatable” and there was no reason why Roma couldn’t be the ones to prove that against the Inter juggernaut. What a blessed relief to hear words of encouragement and positivity after Mourinho’s endless moaning about the lack of resources, culminating in his plea: “I am not a magician. I am not Harry Potter.”The facts are that this is a good Roma squad, more than capable of challenging for a top four spot now that Napoli are floundering. They have an excellent youth academy to draw upon, plenty of internationals in the side, and must be encouraged to believe in themselves rather than be treated as a millstone around the neck of a legendary coach. No, Mourinho, this Roma side was not holding you back. You were holding them back.Even more refreshing was hearing De Rossi in his post-match press conference assuring that he would not have considered Marcus Thuram’s offside position to be interfering with play on the Francesco Acerbi goal. After almost three years of non-stop sackcloth and ashes at every single refereeing decision – or scheduling choice, or the weather, or anything else that could be blamed rather than his own errors – what a blessed relief to have a Roma coach who did not seek an alibi.De Rossi had his own fair share of red cards as a player and was known to lose his temper on occasion, but he now realises the responsibility of the new role and wants to set that example not just for his squad, but the fans too. Whereas Mourinho’s ranting and raving – which he was still going on about in an unrelated interview just before his dismissal – after the Europa League Final resulted in referee Anthony Taylor and his family getting chairs thrown at them in the airport the next day, De Rossi refuses to tap into the victim mentality that the Portuguese coach instead fuelled with paranoid ravings.What a wonderful sight to have a Roma coach who so clearly and loudly believes in his players, his club, his fans and his future. Mourinho always acted as if he was slumming it at the Olimpico, but De Rossi would rather be nowhere else.Lihat jejak penerbit","length":3392,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,9,7,7,8,8,9],"reason":"The article is highly rated for its accuracy as it provides a detailed account of the events and statements made by Daniele De Rossi, contrasting them with Jose Mourinho's negativity.

Several owners say that most tankers are sourcing water beyond 10 km. Thus, the price cap instituted now is unfeasible, they argue. “Most tankers travel over 15 km between the source and the destination. So this order does not make any sense,” said Shashikumar, president, Bommanahalli Water Tankers’ Association. Another water tanker dealer, Praveen Reddy from Doddanekkundi, said he travelled 20 km one way to fetch water, some 11 km beyond Varthur, as all borewells nearby have gone dry. “The site of commercial exploration of water, which was earlier near Varthur, has now moved far beyond it. One trip from our office to the source and the destination covers over 40 km. Our costs for one such trip add up to ₹1,900. Any price cap below that will not work. And the government fixing the price cap only for trips less than 10 km is meaningless and completely divorced from ground reality,” he said. Madhu, tanker owner, said the price cap is unfeasible even for shorter trips. “As most borewells have dried up in the city limits, borewell owners charge more for every load extracted. For instance, at a source just 1 km away from our office, they charge ₹1,000 for a 12,000-litre load to be extracted from the borewell. The government order caps the maximum price at ₹1,000 for this trip,” he said. Will resolve issue soonDeputy Commissioner Bengaluru Urban Dayananda K.A. talking to The Hindu explained that beyond 10 km was not stipulated by the administration as the Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) request was limited to 10 km. “After the request, I discussed the issue with the technical advisory committee. Based on the suggestion of the expert panel, the price was fixed. If the BWSSB puts forth another proposal for more than 10 km, the district administration will act upon it,” he said. “We will put up a proposal to the Deputy Commissioner seeking directions on the price cap and mechanism to decide if the distance between the source of water and the customer is more than 10 km. We will resolve this issue soon,” said Ram Prasath Manohar, BWSSB chairman.","length":2526,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T17:14:59.000Z","rating":[7,8,8,5,7,6,7],"reason":"The article provides a clear explanation of the concerns raised by water tanker owners regarding the price cap set by the city administration.

This has become the reality for many bats thanks to rising temperatures and climate change. A study from the University of Barcelona shows how bats are adjusting to shorter winters. This affects their sleep patterns, where they travel, and their job as nature’s pest control.Climate change and bat hibernationMany bat species living in areas with moderate climates use hibernation as a way to survive the winter. This is a difficult time for bats because their usual food source, insects, are not readily available. To deal with this, bats enter a state called torpor. In the state of torpor, the bats’ body functions slow down significantly. Their body temperature drops, and they use much less energy than usual. This allows the bats to live off the fat they stored up before winter and survive the cold months without needing to find food.Schreiber’s bent-winged batsThe Barcelona team studied Schreiber’s bent-winged bats for 20 years to see how they cope with rising temperatures. They tracked the bats’ weight and fat content throughout their hibernation cycle. The researchers observed that these bats entered and exited hibernation weighing less over time, even though winter temperatures became warmer during the study period. Interestingly, despite this weight loss, the bats didn’t lose a significant amount of fat reserves. Earlier spring activityAs the Earth’s temperature rises, winters are becoming milder and springs are starting earlier. This has led bats to wake up from their winter sleep sooner than usual. While this change might seem like a good thing at first, allowing them to be active for a longer period, it also comes with risks.“The fat reserves they accumulate should be large enough to survive the whole winter without eating. However, due to shorter winters and higher temperatures, bats are not fattening up in autumn as they used to do years ago, because they do not need that much fat to get through the winter,” explained Professor Jordi Serra-Cobo.Bats are hibernating in warmer cavesIn the past, bats preferred the cooler, deeper parts of caves to hibernate during winter. However, due to rising global temperatures, these areas are losing their coolness. As a result, bats are being forced to find cooler spots closer to cave entrances for their hibernation. The shift in location exposes them to greater danger from predators, like genets, who can more easily access these areas near the cave opening. This new challenge makes it even harder for bats to survive the winter.Potential impact on pest controlAs previously mentioned, bats are very important for keeping insect populations, including harmful pests and insects that spread diseases, under control. Waking up early in spring could have a big impact on the life cycle of the insects they eat. If both the bats and the insects wake up earlier at the same time due to warmer weather, it might not affect how well the bats control pest populations. This suggests that there is a complex balance in nature where changes in one animal’s behavior due to climate change can affect other things in the environment, like pest control. However, unpredictable weather – especially an unexpected cold snap in the spring – could be dangerous for bats that wake up early because they won’t have enough stored fat to survive. Varying impacts across all bat speciesThe experts found that different bat species are affected by climate change in different ways. Bats that live in areas like the Mediterranean, which are already warm, seem to be better able to handle climate change than bats in colder regions. This shows that climate change can have complicated effects on wildlife, with some animals being able to adapt to new conditions more easily than others. The study serves as a stark reminder of the far-reaching effects of climate change, even on resilient creatures like bats. As the world warms, understanding and addressing the complex challenges they face will be crucial to ensure their survival in a rapidly changing environment.The study is published in the journal Scientific Reports.—–Like what you read?

A handful of its striking architectural ingredients? A metal-coated façade of deep textured orange. A sauna with cut-out openings framing skies. Spice lemon and chai flavoured ice creams. Raw concrete staircases with colour-tinted windows. And a plant-filled design studio.(Image credit: Kenta Hasegawa)Nekoyacho Bldg: an 'experimental playground''Eat, work and rejuvenate' is the philosophy behind Nekoyacho Bldg., which Suppose Design Office describes as an experimental playground – a space for exploring their own design ideas with a rare purity, while creating a sense of both culture and community.Located near the Peace Memorial Park, the building is home to a mix of restaurants, galleries, event spaces, a sauna and a rooftop terrace, alongside their new design studio – threaded together by a raw-edged renovation that strips off decades of decorative layers to reveal the industrial essence of its original form.(Image credit: Kenta Hasegawa)For Suppose Design Office, the project is something of a homecoming: the studio was originally founded in Hiroshima in 2000 by Ai Yoshida and Makoto Tanijiri, both hailing from the region, although its main hub has been in Tokyo for the past 15 years. After purchasing the five-storey Hiroshima building a few years ago, Yoshida realised that their ideal work environment was more like a 'playground' than an office. 'As designers by profession, we believe that an office that keeps us mentally and physically healthy and creative at all times is a place where we can really get excited and nurture our own ideas and creativity. With this in mind, we began planning an office and commercial facility, aiming for a place that is a crossroads of 'food, work, and entertainment' with a good mix of Hiroshima and Tokyo cultures.'(Image credit: Kenta Hasegawa)The unique angular façade tells its own story. The original tiles of the 50-year-old corner building were stripped off, leaving behind the unexpected grid-like imprints of their former presence, which was then preserved in a metal coating – creating a deeply textured and rust-like surface atmosphere.Emphasising a desire for the design to reflect an 'acceptance' of the building’s unique qualities, Yoshida adds: 'Architecture can be compared to mixed martial art, and renovation is akin to aikido. We wanted to take over the relationship between the building and the city and renew it into a new place by 'accepting and utilising' the individuality of the building, such as inflexible structure and an excess design.'(Image credit: Kenta Hasegawa)The buzzy ground floor is home to four restaurants with open communal-style seating. Suppose reinterpreted the materials and forms of the original structure to create new spaces – from benches fashioned from existing window frames to a clutch of hovering organic balls of light suspended from the ceiling made from original FPR. Among the restaurants is Shashokudo, a canteen 'for staff and society' which already exists in Suppose’s Tokyo studio, serving an array of healthy all-day dining meals; Tsukanto, specialising in new wave tonkatsu and natural wines; Sibire, a charcoal barbecue eatery; and Yacone, creators of craft ice cream in original flavours.(Image credit: Kenta Hasegawa)The sweeping lines of an original staircase, stripped back to its raw concrete bones, sit to the left of the ground floor, its bottom step removed and replaced with the organic form of a single boulder stone, hinting at the threshold of a traditional space such as tearoom.The stairs flow into a first floor open-plan concrete-walled gallery and events space; while a rear staircase, equally raw in its material renovation, with vintage windows in coloured glass on the landing, rise to the second floor where Suppose Design Office’s new Hiroshima studio is based, with co-working spaces.(Image credit: Kenta Hasegawa)Inside is a warm mesh of woods, concrete and plants in an earthy-toned palette. A long Lauan wood table is lined with the arced lines of ten Naoto Fukasawa-designed Maruni chairs, above which floats a long glass tube pendant light, while exotic ferns burst from an interior garden and another wall is lined with integrated bookcases.  One floor up is vacant office space (transformed into an atmospheric contemporary ikebana exhibition during Wallpaper*s visit); while the top floor is home to Hiki stargazing sauna.(Image credit: Kenta Hasegawa)Here, a contemporary sauna is wrapped in clean-lined wood, overlooking a plant-packed internal garden – known as a 'tsuboniwa' in traditional Japanese architecture – with cut out openings framing views of the skies. And at the apex is a rooftop terrace, a lush urban escape packed with fruit trees, plants and herb, from biwa and rosemary to olives.For Suppose, Nekoyacho Bldg. may be open but it’s far from finished: instead, it’s designed as a project that will continue to grow and adapt through its uses and interactions with the community. (Image credit: Kenta Hasegawa)As Yoshida says: 'We tried creating the spaces we wanted to create and the architecture that impresses us. We would like to explore our own unique way of working and a new way of being a design firm through this kind of challenge.''Nekoyacho Bldg. is a playground made together with the people and city and a place for our ever-changing spatial experiments.'nekoya-cho.jpsuppose.jp\nReceive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox","length":5647,"publishedTime":"2023-12-23T12:00:10+00:00","rating":[8,9,8,7,9,8,9],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the Nekoyacho Building in Hiroshima, detailing its architectural features and the philosophy behind its design.

This made it one of the five strongest El Nino events ever, though it was weaker than the 1997/98 and 2015/2016 events.El Niño is mainly a seasonal climate phenomenon with climate impacts on seasonal climate averages but can make extreme weather and climate-events more likely in certain regions. Furthermore, the seasonal forecasts are found to be more accurate during El Niño and La Niña events, particularly in the tropics, and this emphasizes the pivotal role of early warnings to support decision-making and enhance preparedness and anticipatory action.El Niño is associated with increased rainfall triggering flooding in the Horn of Africa and the southern United States of America, and unusually dry and warm conditions in South East Asia, Australia and southern Africa. It has exacerbated drought in northern South America and has also contributed to drier and warmer conditions in parts of southern Africa.“El Niño events have a major impact on societies and economies.

Early warnings of weather and climate extremes associated with El Niño have saved countless lives,” said Celeste Saulo.\nGlobal Seasonal Climate UpdateEl Niño and La Niña are major – but not the only – drivers of the Earth’s climate system.In addition to the long-established ENSO Update, WMO now also issues regular Global Seasonal Climate Updates (GSCU), which incorporate influences of other climate phenomenon such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole.The Global Seasonal Climate Update says that Positive temperature anomalies are expected over almost the entire Northern Hemisphere except in the far south-eastern part of North America, as well as over most of the land areas in the Southern Hemisphere.Predictions for rainfall in the forthcoming three months (March to May) are similar to some of the canonical rainfall patterns associated with El Niño.The WMO El Niño/La NIña and Global Seasonal Climate Updates as part of the Early Warnings for All initiative are based on forecasts from WMO Global Producing Centres of Long-Range Forecasts and are available to support governments, the United Nations, humanitarian agencies and decision-makers to mobilize preparations and protect lives and livelihoods.National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) will closely monitor the situation in the months to come and provide updated outlooks on the dissipation of El Niño and the possible development of La Niña.

Inflation is way down from its painful double-digit peak. But there likely won’t be an interest rate cut at the European Central Bank’s meeting Thursday, even as higher borrowing costs weigh on the stalled economy.\nECB President Christine Lagarde is likely to emphasize that the bank wants to see conclusive evidence that inflation figures will keep gliding down toward the bank’s goal of 2%.\nThat is the read from analysts who follow the bank, and financial markets seem to be falling into line. While they had previously priced in a chance for a rate cut as early as April, those bets have faded and markets now are factoring in a quarter-point cut in June.\nA similar situation is shaping up in the U.S., where Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told Congress on Wednesday that the central bank needs more confidence inflation is under control before cutting rates. Fed officials have signaled three rate cuts this year, but Powell has given no indication when they might start.\nIn Europe, inflation was down to 2.6% in February, well below its peak of 10.6% in October 2022. But the consumer price index has been stuck between 2% and 3% for five months, raising concern that the last mile toward the ECB’s goal may be slower than hoped.\nWhile the spikes in food and energy prices that helped drive the outbreak of inflation have eased, inflation has spread to services, a broad sector of the economy that includes everything from movie tickets and office cleaning to tuition and medical care.\nMeanwhile, wages rose as workers started bargaining for higher pay to make up for lost purchasing power as inflation ballooned.\nPrices for natural gas — which is used to power factories, heat homes and generate electricty — have fallen to around 24 euros ($26) per megawatt hour, not much higher than levels seen before Russia started threatening Ukraine.\nAnd oil prices have been flat as Saudi Arabia and other members of the OPEC+ coalition of oil producers maintain cuts to output that have only put a floor under prices.\n“Given that most officials seem to be coalescing around a start to the easing cycle in June, the (ECB) governing council is likely content with current market pricing,” wrote analysts at ABN AMRO Financial Markets Research. “Therefore, the aim of communication following the end of the meeting will likely try to not rock the boat one way or the other.”\nLagarde’s message will likely be that “the central bank wants to see more evidence that domestic inflationary pressures are abating,” the analysts said in a note.\nThe ECB has raised its key rate from minus 0.5% to a record-high 4% in just over a year, starting in July 2022. Higher interest rates dampen inflation by making it more expensive to borrow and buy things on credit, reducing demand for goods. But high rates can weigh on economic growth, too.\nPressure for a rate cut is coming as the economy has stalled. The 20 countries that use the euro currency saw no growth in the fourth quarter of last year after shrinking 0.1% in the previous quarter. Germany, Europe’s largest economy, expects to grow just 0.2% this year.\nComplicating matters is the fact that it’s not a classic downturn because unemployment remains low. Markets will watch closely for signals on when the first rate cut will come.\nWith recent economic data, “the pressure on the ECB to cut rates earlier has gone up,” Carsten Brzeski, chief of global macro at ING bank, wrote in an analyst note. “We still think that the ECB has good reasons to resist that pressure and to push back expectations.”\nLagarde’s comments at her post-meeting news conference will likely be “sending more precise signals for a June rate cut,” he said.Subscribe to the new Fortune CEO Weekly Europe newsletter to get corner office insights on the biggest business stories in Europe.

While the developers claim this is just the beginning, it’s not looking promising considering how much money is involved. Who Is The Best Hang In Unicorn Overlord? A Scientific RankingOffEnglishOn February 29, the third major playtest for the upcoming NFT-powered metaverse project—Otherside—happened. The event was called “Apes Come Home,” and the big news was that folks who owned a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT could arrive, see their NFT realized in full 3D, and gain access to an exclusive digital clubhouse. Here players could walk around, take selfies, twerk, walk some more, and do all of this in silence as the test didn’t support text or voice chat. All the more time to contemplate whether spending $70,000 on a digital monkey to gain “exclusive benefits” in a Second Life knock-off was actually worth it.Otherside is a still-in-development browser-based NFT metaverse MMO that is being developed by Yuga Labs, the company responsible for Bored Apes and Mutant Apes. In May 2022, Yuga was able to sell $300 million worth of digital land in the upcoming game. So there’s a lot of money involved. Yuga claims that Otherside will support multiple NFT types and eventually contain user-created games, like Roblox. To help build this large metaverse, Yuga has held a series of “trips” or tests in the past. The first was held in 2022. The second in 2023. These, however, were barebones affairs using default avatars and temporary assets. February 29’s event was different, as it was meant to showcase one of the 200,000 land plots that will make up Otherside, as well as show Bored and Mutant Ape owners what all their money is going to get them.Looking at videos and pictures of the event, Otherside doesn’t look great. The graphics aren’t ugly, but extremely bland. The performance is choppy. And animations are limited. It looks more like a browser-based 3D chat room from 2013 than a big, expensive 2024 metaverse project. But it falls short in that comparison, too, because at least in even the cheapest, crappiest of those virtual chat rooms, you could talk to people. You can’t actually chat in Otherside.The moment players arrive in the NFT metaverse, they are attacked by a goat. This is the “lore” behind why nobody can talk. They are then given a camera by a little digital creature called a “Koda” and set free to run around aimlessly and look at this first part of Otherside. If you owned an ape NFT, you’d be able to play as your NFT re-recreated as a 3D avatar. If not, you run around as some weird techno-voyager-robot thing, though only ape holders could access the clubhouse in the swamp.“This is the thing that spending $75,000 on this NFT got me, access to this place here,” said Orangie, an NFT content creator, when they entered the clubhouse for the first time. They sounded excited—or at least like they were pretending to be—but as they walked around this exclusive bar/clubhouse, I wasn’t sure the privilege was worth even $75. The place looked about as fun as a random building in World of Warcraft.In an official video from Otherside, an ape is seen taking a selfie in a bathroom as another ape twerks in a stall. If this clubhouse action sounds like a good time to you, well, you’ll need to buy an ape. The cheapest one as of this writing is around $72,000. But, actually, you can’t play Otherside anymore. Sorry?During the “Apes Come Home” event, Yuga only let players run around this area of Otherside for 60 minutes. They held three separate hour-long sessions. They said this was to give everyone a chance to enter and to limit strain on the servers. I think the time limit was because they know there’s not much to see or do in this first world and the devs didn’t want anyone sticking around for a few hours and figuring that out. Though even Orangie, a person who has spent at least $70,000 on NFTs and is a true believer in this metaverse/clubhouse concept, admitted in their video review that they got bored of just flying and walking around mostly empty-looking landscapes with their expensive ape avatar.Perhaps Otherside will expand into more in the future. Yuga Labs has big plans, at least. The studio says it wants to turn Otherside into an experience that can support user-made games and content, similar to Roblox or Fortnite. However, those games are free-to-play and have deals with big brands like Star Wars. Otherside’s pricey entry fee—the cheapest option for entrance appears to be buying an Otherdeed NFT for around $600—and lack of gameplay or big IP will be a hard sell for kids and folks looking for a new online game. And that’s assuming this thing ever actually launches. .","length":4806,"publishedTime":"2024-03-01T13:30:00-05:00","rating":[2,3,4,2,3,3,2],"reason":"The article scores low in accuracy due to its limited coverage and lack of in-depth analysis about the Otherside metaverse project and its implications.

Pittsburgh","excerpt":"A new cellphone app that uses AI to accurately diagnose ear infections could be more accurate that trained clinicians.","textContent":"A new smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to accurately diagnose ear infections, or acute otitis media, could help decrease unnecessary antibiotic use in young children, according to new research.\nAcute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood infections for which antibiotics are prescribed but can be difficult to discern from other ear conditions without intensive training.\nThe new AI tool, which makes a diagnosis by assessing a short video of the ear drum captured by an otoscope connected to a cellphone camera, offers a simple and effective solution that could be more accurate than trained clinicians.\n“Acute otitis media is often incorrectly diagnosed,” says senior author Alejandro Hoberman, professor of pediatrics and director of the division of general academic pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and senior author of the study in JAMA Pediatrics.\n“Underdiagnosis results in inadequate care and overdiagnosis results in unnecessary antibiotic treatment, which can compromise the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics. Our tool helps get the correct diagnosis and guide the right treatment.”\nAbout 70% of children have an ear infection before their first birthday, Hoberman says. Although this condition is common, accurate diagnosis of AOM requires a trained eye to detect subtle visual findings gained from a brief view of the ear drum on a wriggly baby.\nAOM is often confused with otitis media with effusion, or fluid behind the ear, a condition that generally does not involve bacteria and does not benefit from antimicrobial treatment.\nTo develop a practical tool to improve accuracy in the diagnosis of AOM, Hoberman and his team started by building and annotating a training library of 1,151 videos of the tympanic membrane from 635 children who visited outpatient UPMC pediatric offices between 2018 and 2023. Two trained experts with extensive experience in AOM research reviewed the videos and made a diagnosis of AOM or not AOM.\n“The ear drum, or tympanic membrane, is a thin, flat piece of tissue that stretches across the ear canal,” says Hoberman. “In AOM, the ear drum bulges like a bagel, leaving a central area of depression that resembles a bagel hole. In contrast, in children with otitis media with effusion, no bulging of the tympanic membrane is present.”\nThe researchers used 921 videos from the training library to teach two different AI models to detect AOM by looking at features of the tympanic membrane, including shape, position, color, and translucency. Then they used the remaining 230 videos to test how the models performed.\nBoth models were highly accurate, producing sensitivity and specificity values of greater than 93%, meaning that they had low rates of false negatives and false positives.\nAccording to Hoberman, previous studies of clinicians have reported diagnostic accuracy of AOM ranging from 30% to 84%, depending on type of health care provider, level of training, and age of the children being examined.\n“These findings suggest that our tool is more accurate than many clinicians,” says Hoberman. “It could be a gamechanger in primary health care settings to support clinicians in stringently diagnosing AOM and guiding treatment decisions.”\n“Another benefit of our tool is that the videos we capture can be stored in a patient’s medical record and shared with other providers,” says Hoberman. “We can also show parents and trainees—medical students and residents—what we see and explain why we are or are not making a diagnosis of ear infection. It is important as a teaching tool and for reassuring parents that their child is receiving appropriate treatment.”\nHoberman hopes that the technology could soon be implemented widely across health care provider offices to enhance accurate diagnosis of AOM and support treatment decisions.\nAdditional coauthors are from the University of Pittsburgh, New York University, Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, and Dcipher Analytics.\nThe pediatrics department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine supported the work.","length":4212,"publishedTime":"2024-03-05T14:37:19+00:00","rating":[8,7,7,6,8,8,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed explanation of a new smartphone app that is claimed to accurately diagnose ear infections in children better than trained clinicians.

But the concerts — and what the government did to secure them — have sparked some bad blood between Singapore and neighboring Southeast Asian countries and territories. Singapore this week confirmed it negotiated a deal with Swift's concert promoters, paying an undisclosed sum of money to ensure that Singapore was her only stop in the region. Rumors of the exclusive deal had sparked outcry among Southeast Asian neighbors, with a Philippine lawmaker demanding an explanation, Thailand's prime minister claiming Singapore paid millions of dollars per concert for the deal, and Hong Kong's chief executive insisting his city was still an attractive destination for mega events. \n Singapore's prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, defended the exclusive deal at a press conference on Tuesday. \"A deal was reached. And so it has turned out to be a very successful arrangement. I don't see that as being unfriendly,\" he said at an Asian summit in Melbourne. Lee added that an \"incentive\" had been paid for the deal. The Singapore Tourism Board declined to comment on the amount, citing business confidentiality. AEG Presents, Swift's concert promoter, did not respond to a request for comment. Following Lee's remarks, Philippine lawmaker Joey Salceda told a local newspaper that Singapore was operating by \"the law of the jungle\" and not the law of a \"neighborhood of countries bound by supposed principles of solidarity and consensus.\" Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines typically enjoy smooth diplomatic relations. They are all members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, a regional economic and security bloc. Underneath the heated rhetoric is a growing industry worth billions of dollars. Event tourism — like Swift's concerts — brings in a lot of money for cities. Research firm Business Markets Insights expects the Asia Pacific events market to grow to nearly 550 billion dollars by 2028. \n Fans of singer Taylor Swift take pictures next to an installation in the \"Eras Tour Trail\" that depicts different eras of the pop star's career, at the Marina Bay Sands complex in Singapore, on Feb. 28. More than 300,000 Swifties from Singapore and neighboring countries will attend the U.S. superstar's six sold-out Eras Tour shows at the National Stadium from March 2-9.\n Fans of singer Taylor Swift take pictures next to an installation in the \"Eras Tour Trail\" that depicts different eras of the pop star's career, at the Marina Bay Sands complex in Singapore, on Feb. 28. More than 300,000 Swifties from Singapore and neighboring countries will attend the U.S. superstar's six sold-out Eras Tour shows at the National Stadium from March 2-9.\n \"Event tourism is a key trend,\" said Erica Tay, an economist in Singapore with Malaysia-based Malayan Banking Berhad, or Maybank. \n Younger travelers crave experiences, more than stuff, and are more likely to travel to a city to attend a concert or watch a sporting event, she said. \"By hosting Taylor Swift and other A-list acts, I think Singapore is building its credentials to be an event tourism hub,\" she added. Tay estimates Swift's concerts will bring in $370 million in tourism receipts to the country in a little over a week, while the pop star is in town. When nearby cities see the multimillion dollar boost they are missing out on, it prompts some soul searching. Last month, Hong Kong's chief executive, John Lee, was asked by reporters about Singapore's efforts to get Swift, and whether Hong Kong is being ambitious enough when it comes to securing mega events. \"We know we'll be competing with different cities. And we'll ensure we're attractive enough and competitive enough,\" he said. Until that happens, Hong Kong is losing out on fans spending big bucks to see performers like Coldplay, Ed Sheeran and now Taylor Swift — top acts that skipped Hong Kong, but played in Singapore. Husband and wife Haseeb Khan and Audie Wibowo paid about $450 each for their Swift tickets, plus another $300 each for flights from Hong Kong. They plan to stay with family in Singapore. \n Taylor Swift fans, known as a Swifties, take photos as they arrive for the first of the pop star's six sold-out Eras Tour concerts at the National Stadium in Singapore on March 2.\n Taylor Swift fans, known as a Swifties, take photos as they arrive for the first of the pop star's six sold-out Eras Tour concerts at the National Stadium in Singapore on March 2.\n \"I think it's totally worth it,\" said Khan. \"It's Taylor Swift, it's like a once-in-a-generation tour.\" Wibowo, a self-described long-time Swiftie, said she has never traveled so far for a music concert before, but was determined to go to one of Swift's Singapore shows. \n \"Even if my family wasn't there, my friends weren't there, if we didn't have anything in Singapore to go to, we would still go,\" she said. It was a similar story for 13-year-old Anoushka and her mom Neha Malik. Malik used loyalty points for their flights from Hong Kong to Singapore, to offset the steep price they paid of about $750 per ticket. \n \"It is a big splurge, but it's kind of like birthday, Christmas, everything rolled into one,\" she said. \"Better to have one big memory which will last forever.\" Getting nearby Swifties to fly in and splurge on her concerts is exactly what Singapore officials wanted. Beyond an economic boost, there's also the reputational lift Swift's presence brings. \"Her endorsement of Singapore, you know, will really put the country on the map for hundreds of millions of her fans,\" said Tay, the economist. \n \"It's hard to put a value on it, but I think it's really positive.\"","length":7718,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T05:06:33-05:00","rating":[6,5,7,5,8,7,8],"reason":[{"Accuracy":"The article provides accurate information on Taylor Swift's concerts in Singapore and the controversies surrounding the exclusive deal with the government."},{"Objectivity":"The article presents different perspectives from Singapore and its Southeast Asian neighbors regarding the exclusive deal, showing a balanced view."},{"Clarity and Coherence":"The article is well-structured, organized, and written in a coherent manner, making it easy to follow."},{"Depth of Analysis":"While the article covers the economic impact of event tourism and the reactions from neighboring countries, it could delve deeper into the political implications of such deals."},{"Language and Presentation":"The language used is clear, and the overall presentation is engaging with vivid descriptions."},{"Readability":"The article is readable with an appropriate level of complexity for the topic discussed."},{"Attractive":"The writing style is engaging and capable of maintaining the reader's interest throughout."}],"conclusion":1},{"lang":"en","siteName":"International Criminal Court","link":"https://www.icc-cpi.int/news/situation-ukraine-icc-judges-issue-arrest-warrants-against-sergei-ivanovich-kobylash-and","title":"Situation in Ukraine: ICC judges issue arrest warrants against Sergei Ivanovich Kobylash and Viktor Nikolayevich Sokolov","byline":null,"excerpt":"Today, 5 March 2024, Pre-Trial Chamber II of the International Criminal Court, composed of Judge Rosario Salvatore Aitala, Presiding, Judge Tomoko Akane and Judge Sergio Gerardo Ugalde Godinez (“ICC” or “Court”) issued warrants of arrest for two individuals, Mr Sergei Ivanovich Kobylash and Mr Viktor Nikolayevich Sokolov, in the context of the situation in Ukraine for alleged crimes committed from at least 10 October 2022 until at least 9 March 2023.

Jean Carroll’s $83.3 m verdict in her recent defamation case.The decision by US district judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan adds to pressure on Trump to line up an acceptable bond during his expected appeal.In the 26 January verdict, jurors agreed with Carroll, a former Elle magazine advice columnist, that Trump had defamed her in June 2019 by denying he had raped her in the mid-1990s in a Bergdorf Goodman department store dressing room in Manhattan.Kaplan made the verdict official on 8 February and gave Trump 30 days to post a bond or come up with cash during his appeal, which is expected to challenge the jury’s finding of liability and the amount of damages.Trump had sought to delay enforcement of the verdict until the judge ruled on his motions to throw it out, which he filed on Tuesday.But the judge said Trump should not have waited 25 days after the verdict before seeking a delay.He also said Trump failed to show how he might suffer “irreparable injury” if required to post a bond.“Mr Trump’s current situation is a result of his own dilatory actions,” the judge wrote.Lawyers and a spokeswoman for Trump did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Carroll’s lawyer Roberta Kaplan, who is not related to the judge, declined to comment.In seeking to avoid posting a big bond, or any bond at all, lawyers for Trump rejected Carroll’s claim that his finances were strained.They assured that Carroll was “fully protected” and said a $24.5m bond would be more than enough to “secure any minimal risk” to her.Carroll disagreed. She said Trump’s finances were opaque, called Trump the “least trustworthy of borrowers” and said his request “boils down to nothing more than, ‘Trust me.’”Trump’s financial flexibility deteriorated last month, when the judge who found him liable in New York attorney general Letitia James’s civil fraud case ordered him to pay $454.2m.He offered to post a $100m bond in that case, but James said any bond should cover the entire judgment.An appeals court judge on 28 February denied Trump’s request to delay enforcement during the appeal.Asked on 5 March if he could pay what was owed or post bond in both cases, Trump told Fox News: “I have a lot of money. I can do what I want to do … I don’t worry about the money.”","length":2362,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T23:58:21.000Z","rating":[7,8,6,6,7,7,6],"reason":"The article provides accurate information on the recent denial of Donald Trump's request to delay the $83.3 million verdict in E.

Titled with inspiration from a line in Omar Khayyam’s Rubaiyat [Quatrains], the exhibition which brings together over 600 works, functional objects, rarities, furniture, and books produced in different periods explores the relations that emerge through the juxtapositions formed by a collection. Suppose You Are Not will be on view at Arter from January 19, 2024.\nCurated by Selen Ansen, the exhibition Suppose You Are Not probes the ways in which the domestic context of a private collection can be transferred into a museum context. In so doing, it explores the possibilities of restaging and articulating the affinities created between distinct objects by means of a collector’s desires and endeavours. The exhibition, which spans the 4th and 3rd-floor galleries of Arter, brings together works by almost 400 artists, anonymous artefacts and mass-produced items, as well as multifarious objects. Initially formed for an individual purpose within the boundaries of a private space, now made public through a curatorial approach in an art institution, this body of works presents a world at the junction of times and forms that defy habitual classifications. This world, which brings to existence the collector as an abstract subject interacting with the artefacts in their possession, allows a form of experience that connects reality and fiction, as objects leaving the private sphere reformulate their unique character in a new context. Approaching the collection as a multifaceted and living organism, Suppose You Are Not proposes to reflect upon the kinship between the ordinary and the extraordinary, the practice of collecting and the objects that populate our daily lives.\nFormed with works selected from the Ömer Koç Collection, Suppose You Are Not is concerned with finding worldly ways to rise upwards in the world where everything falls and keeps falling, and with providing possibilities to formulate infinitude where finitude is the rule. Based on Omar Khayyam’s (1048-1131) verses, where the poet reminds us to embrace life freely by transcending the limits of our own selves, the exhibition invites visitors to challenge given boundaries while exploring the attribution of new meanings to objects in a realm devoid of chronology and hierarchy.\nIn this territory populated by objects of all sorts, the conglomeration of books, furniture, paintings, sculptures and photographs not only tells us of human pleasures, desires, aspirations and dreams of past lives; it also reflects the spirited viewpoint of the collector. Suppose You Are Not delves into the passionate striving to collect and preserve the traces of humanity, the good and the evil, the ephemeral gestures, states, allusions and movements ranging from the most sublime to the most mundane, from the most permanent to the most ephemeral, which manage to persist by being conveyed from the dead to the living. Through the connections they give birth to in the exhibition space, the numerous works and objects brought together open up a field of vision that allows the emergence of new associations and alliances.\nPress contact: Senem Çelikörslü, senemc [​at​] arter.org.tr / T +90 212 708 58 45","length":3724,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,8,7,9,8,9],"reason":"The article provides detailed information about the exhibition \"Suppose You Are Not\" held at Arter, covering a wide range of aspects like the artworks, themes, and the curator's vision.

Another quick start on a goal from John Hirschfeld gave the Crusaders a 1-0 lead just 18 seconds into the game. But the Raiders countered with a goal from Cayden Monson 13:04 into the first to tie it at 1. Monson's goal came on a quick wrist shot that Hansen didn't have time to get his glove on. \"When you're back in the state tournament, there's always nerves at first,\" Hansen said. \"We played our game after the first period and the defense played well in front of me and made some great plays.

They're really good. That's a top five or six team in the state. They pushed us really hard early on. Some of that was us not playing our game. \"The message after the first period was get back to our identity and play our type of hockey. Once we settled into that, we dictated the pace of the game.\" Northfield head coach Mike Luckcraft thought his team had good opportunities against Hansen, but couldn't capitalize when it counted. \n \"He's good. We had an opportunity to shoot a few times and didn't,\" Luckcraft said. \"We tried to get some rebounds and make a few plays. We didn't test him as much as I was hoping. We had a game plan there. But he hasn't lost all year for a reason. \"We knew it was going to be a big challenge against him. We could only sneak one by him unfortunately.\" After the first period, the Crusaders were a different team. Cathedral scored two second-period goals and solved Northfield goalie Max Frank. Landon Swenson gave the Crusaders a 2-1 edge on a goal 7:32 into the second. A quick wrist shot by Joe Gillespie resulted in the second goal of the period to put CHS up 3-1.Cathedral poured it on in the third period with two more goals on Frank.

Sturm credited Hansen for settling the Crusaders down after the first period. \"Nick's been playing great all year,\" Sturm said. \"He's always talking to us back there and helping us out.

Cathedral beat the Warriors 3-2 in overtime back on Nov. 25 in Warroad. Hansen made 41 saves while facing 43 shots in that game. Hansen feels like he'll see a different version of the Warriors on Friday. Warroad beat Cathedral 5-1 in the Class A state quarterfinals last season. \n \"I know they're going to want to get us back after what happened earlier in the year,\" Hansen said. \"I'm confident we can play our game, just like we did up there, and come away with a win.\" Hansen was injured early in a 5-3 loss to Rock Ridge on Dec. 16 at the Municipal Athletic Complex (MAC) and didn't return until Jan. 18 in a 9-1 win at Princeton. Now, he's helped the Crusaders to a 13-game winning streak headed into Friday.\"We had a rough stretch in the middle of the season when Nick went out,\" Stocker said. \"I think that allowed us to figure out some things on the defensive end.

As a result the oil embargo and price cap failed to have a significant impact on the Russian economy, especially in 2022. That is starting to change in 2023 after the G7 imposed the twin oil embargos on crude on December 5 2022 and oil products on February 5 last year. \n“Lots of key sanctions were not in place in 2022 like the oil embargos so it was raining foreign exchange. It was a wonderful situation for Russians ,” said Higlenstock. “That has dramatically changed in 2023. Then there was a significant decline in oil gas revenues also as Russia failed to weaponize its gas flows to the EU.” \nConversely, Higlenstock presented a more nuanced view. While acknowledging the media's scepticism regarding sanctions' effectiveness during the recent round of articles on the second anniversary of the start of the war. However, he went on to argue that sanctions have significantly impaired the Russian economy by curbing foreign exchange inflows and inputs for military production. He also pointed out that while Russia benefited from the spike in oil and gas prices in 2022, lead to a new all-time record current account surplus of $268bn, that surplus fell to around $50bn last year after the oil sanctions and oil price cap sanctions were imposed last year and so sanctions were having a significant impact on the Kremlin’s finances. \nHiglenstock also took issue with the widely publicised fact that Russia’s GDP growth was a robust 3.6% in 2023 - far more than was expected at the start of the year – especially compared to the recession many of the Western countries are facing as a result of the bounce-back effect of the sanctions. Higlenstock pointed out that the strong Russian growth should be no surprise as the economy is benefiting from a very big fiscal stimuli of massive military spending, but the data does not accurately reflect the sanctions' impact, especially as major sanctions were not fully in place in 2022. Despite the strong growth, the situation in 2023 has seen a notable decline in Russia's oil and gas revenues, alongside restricted access to approximately $300bn of Central Bank of Russia (CBR) reserves that is severely constraining the central bank’s ability to stabilise the economy. \nBoth speakers concurred on the need for heightened enforcement and implementation to counteract Russia's evasive manoeuvres and their constant revision to counter Russia’s evasions. \n“It's a game of cat and mouse,” said Higlenstock. “We have to step up enforcement. Sanctions is a moving target. Russia is very good at adjusting; reworking supply chains, finding ways to evade sanctions and we have to respond to that.“ \nRibakova specifically critiqued the oil price cap's implementation, arguing it aimed to serve multiple objectives but ultimately had limited success in rerouting oil flows and inadvertently bolstered Russia's investment in a shadow fleet for oil transportation. \nHowever, after a year of oil sanctions the Department of the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has recently introduced some much more effective sanctions on the shadow fleet. \n“The OFAC sanctioned 27 ships as while most of these ships carry Liberian flags, they outsourced the registration process to a firm in North Vagina which puts them in reach of sanctions. These ships have been effectively put out of business and are now circling around India with full loads, unable to land,” Higlenstock said. “And since then another 14 ships have been added to the list.” \nHowever, he acknowledged the ongoing challenge of balancing sanctions enforcement with market stability. Higlenstock admitted that “sanctions alone won’t end this war,” but added that they were a necessity to limit the resources available to limiting the resources president Vladimir Putin has at his disposal to perpetrate the war. \nRibakova pointed out that while it was possible to completely isolate a country like Iran with sanctions, those sanctions had no effect on the US economy and only marginal effects on Europe and suggested that Russia is too big to sanction completely. \n“But with a country as large and well integrated as Russia that is not possible,” says Ribakova, adding that the idea of the oil price sanctions are a compromise to allow Russian oil to continue to be sold on the market, while limiting the amount of revenue Russia earns. \nHowever, as almost all Russia’s oil deliveries are operating outside the oil price cap restrictions, with better enforcement it should be possible to squeeze the shadow fleet out of oil shipment and into the transparent shipping where the west can operate its oil price caps thanks to international shipping dependence on Western maritime insurance. \n“In the early days all that was needed from shipping companies was to see a contract that shows price under cap. But they thought of it as a piece of paper that no one will ask for,” says Ribakova. “We went way too far in trying not to upset the commodity markets. In the meantime Russia has been investing in the shadow fleet, not G7 shippers or insurance providers,” adding that by tightening the enforcement of these sanctions that shipping of Russian oil can be forced back into the transparent shipping of Western companies where the oil price cap can be enforced. \nThe dialogue also touched on military equipment trade, where both experts noted Russia has also managed to largely circumnavigate the restrictions by trading via third countries and indirect supply chains. \n“Over 90% of components in military equipment come from our countries. Ukraine is getting more bombed by our countries than it is getting aid,” said Ribakova. \nRibakova emphasised that a significant portion of components in Russian military equipment originates from Western countries, paradoxically making the West indirectly complicit in the conflict. \nHiglenstock pointed out that holding Western producers to become more active in carrying out the necessary due diligence was a question of carrot and the stick. \n“The [Western] banks understand that if they are implicated in facilitating sanctions busting they are liable to hundreds of millions of dollars in fines, but the same is not true to producers. It's a cost benefit trade-off for them, weighing potential profits and the costs of non-compliance.… When these companies are asked to do this sort of due diligence for things like environmental issues they have shown they can.”","length":9837,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[6,6,7,6,7,6,5],"reason":["The article presents a balanced view on the efficacy of sanctions on Russia after two years of war.

On one hand, they are the mechanism by which an employer takes ownership of important types of intellectual property employees create that relates to the job—potentially patentable inventions, which may be trade secrets unless patent protection is sought. In that manner, they safeguard important employer interests, including preventing potential disputes over ownership of key company inventions and ensuring that employers can make necessary representations about ownership of their intellectual property in corporate transactions such as financings and acquisitions. On the other hand, such agreements also provide boundaries under which employees can safely create unrelated intellectual property, such as when planning a new, future start-up company.\nIn order to clarify these boundaries for the benefit of employers as well as employees, and gradually over the decades, several states have enacted invention assignment statutes, which govern what such contracts can and cannot say regarding employer ownership. Some of them also govern which party has the burden of proof and provide safeguards for employee disclosure of intellectual property the employee may own.\nFor example, in California and Washington State, under Labor Code § 2870 and Revised Codes of Washington (RCW) § 49.44.140, respectively, an employer generally cannot claim ownership of patentable inventions or trade secrets that an employee developed entirely on their own time and with their own resources as long as the invention is not related to the employer’s actual or anticipated business. Published court decisions providing guidance on what relates to, or does not relate to, a business are relatively rare.\nNew York has now enacted a new law that follows suit.\nOn September 15, 2023, Governor Kathy Hochul signed into law New York State Senate Bill (S) 5640 (codified as New York Labor Law § 203-F) (203-F). 203-F took immediate effect. 203-F renders employee invention assignment provisions unenforceable if the assignment provision requires the assignment of rights to any invention that does not relate to the employer’s actual or anticipated business, so long as such inventions are developed entirely on the employees’ own time and with their own resources.\nSpecifically, 203-F prohibits assignment of inventions developed by employees entirely on their own time “without using the employer’s equipment, supplies, facilities, or trade secret information.” However, the law includes two important carve-outs. 203-F still permits assignment of inventions to the employer that either: 1) “relate at the time of conception or reduction to practice of the invention to the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer” or 2) “result from any work performed by the employee for the employer.”\nTo put this in plain English, there are six ways a New York employer can own a patentable invention: 1) it relates to the business; 2) it relates to provable current or anticipated R&D; 3) it results from work performed for the employer; or, even if 1-3 do not apply; 4) the employer’s equipment or supplies are used to develop the IP; 5) the employer’s facilities are used to develop the IP; or 6) the employer’s trade secrets are used to develop the IP. The language is disjunctive, so any of these six will suffice for employer ownership.\nAt the same time, 203-F provides that employees who independently innovate, utilizing their own resources and time, and develop an invention that is unrelated to their employer's business, are not bound by any clauses that demand they transfer the intellectual property rights of the invention to their employer. If an employer tries to assert rights over an invention that an employee devised completely on their own time, without the use of the employer’s resources, and the invention is not connected to the employer’s business, the statute provides that the agreement purporting to assign the invention to the employer “shall be unenforceable.”\nThis regime is similar to, but distinct from the separate test used for employer ownership of copyrightable works, the Work for Hire doctrine under the Copyright Act.\n203-F does not expressly specify any penalties for requiring an employee to sign an agreement that is in violation of 203-F. Nonetheless, potential consequences could include a ruling by a court or adjudicating body that the invention assignment provision in an employment agreement is unenforceable. Additionally, the employer could be liable for damages such as compensating the employee for the fair market value of their invention, lost profits, or any unjust enrichment the employer gained or derived from an improper use of the invention, as well as legal fees and costs associated with litigation. Furthermore, invention assignment agreements in violation of 203-F could cause lack of certainty with regard to ownership of intellectual property that is material to the employer.\nAlthough the new law can prevent the assignment of inventions stemming wholly from an employee’s own resources, information, and efforts, 203-F maintains employers’ rights to inventions arising from, or related to, the employees’ work for the employers or the use of the employers’ resources. For example, even under the new law, an employer can require that an employee assigns to the employer all rights to an invention that an employee develops or tests during their working hours or on their employer’s premises, or with the use of any equipment, property, or trade secret information of the employer in the development of the invention, such as a company-issued laptop or mobile device. An employer would likely not be successful in demanding the assignment of an invention if the employer’s equipment or property were only used by employees for communication or other ancillary activities and not for the actual development of the invention. Lastly, even if an employee does not use any employer resources and develops the invention entirely on their non-working hours, under 203-F, the invention may still be deemed assigned to their employer if the invention relates to their employer’s current or future business.\nNotably, New York’s statute does not contain language regarding a burden of proof, or reporting requirements, as seen in other enactments such as California and Washington.\nIn its justification for enacting 203-F, the New York State Senate indicated that economists have linked better intellectual property protection for employees to “more efficient firms and increased economic growth,” as previous assignment clauses effectively prevented employees from trying or investigating new ideas that could transform into new businesses. See S.B. 5640, New York State Senate, 2023 Session. Further, the New York Senate noted that employees tend to relocate to work in jurisdictions with these types of invention assignment protections.\nThe New York State Senate also highlighted the fact that California’s implementation of a similar protection has not impeded growth of its technology sector—an understatement, to say the least. See CA Labor Code § 2870 (through 2012 Leg. Sess.). Since Washington’s enactment in 1979, numerous additional states have passed similar laws, including California (CA Labor Code § 2870), Delaware (Del. Code tit. 19 § 805), Illinois (765 ILCS 1060/2), Kansas (2006 Kansas Code - 44-130), Minnesota (Minn. Stat. § 181.78), New Jersey (NJ Rev. Stat. § 34:1B-265 (2022)), North Carolina (NC Gen Stat § 66-57.1 (2022)), and Utah (Utah Code Section 34-39-3), while Nevada has a substantially different enactment (NV Rev. Stat. § 600.500 (2022)). Although the actual text of each state’s law varies somewhat, the above referenced laws generally prohibit provisions in employment agreements that require the assignment of rights in an invention for which no equipment, supplies, facilities, intellectual property, or trade secret information of the employer were used and where the invention was developed on the employee’s own time. More states may follow suit.\n\tReview Employment Agreements: Employers with employees in New York should diligently work with their employment and intellectual property counsel to review their employment agreements, policies, and procedures, including any offer letters, handbooks, or other policies that include intellectual property language, to ensure they do not require employees to assign inventions that are outside the scope of what is permitted by the new law. A good practice is to include the text of the statute as an exhibit to an employment agreement, as companies typically do in California.\n\tRetroactivity: While 203-F does not expressly state retroactive application, the law indicates that any prohibited provisions cannot be enforced as of September 15, 2023. This unenforceability applies even if the provision is contained in an agreement entered into prior to September 15, 2023. As a result, employers with New York employees should consider whether their agreements with current employees must be updated in light of 203-F. Wilson Sonsini can provide an updated agreement.\n\tDocumentation of Invention Ownership: Although the law does not expressly discuss which party bears the burden of proving ownership rights to an invention, and thus probably puts the burden on the party filing suit, it is in an employer’s best interest to have clear and comprehensive documentation showing an invention was developed within the scope of the employee’s work for the employer, given the importance of clear intellectual property ownership for both the employer’s day-to-day operations as well as future commercial deals, corporate transactions, and exit opportunities.\n\tScope of the Employer’s Business: Since 203-F allows inventions by employees to be assigned to the employer that are related to “the employer’s business, or actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the employer” even if conducted during non-working hours away from the employer’s premises, employers should evaluate whether they have sufficient documentation detailing the scope of their business. Such documentation will permit the employer to fully capture any inventions by employees within such line of business and be best prepared to defend against a claim of ownership over a given invention by the employee.\nIt is essential that employers take appropriate steps to ensure their ownership of intellectual property to which they are entitled. Clear language in employment agreements and thoughtful company policies can avoid unnecessary conflict and confusion for both employer and employee, as well as potential company investors and acquirers down the line. Given the constant evolution of the legal landscape around employer-employee intellectual property rights, the current effectiveness of 203-F, and the frequency of employee movement due to hybrid and remote work, companies should work regularly with their employment and intellectual property counsel to ensure employment contracts, policies, and other agreements comply with all laws related to assignment of inventions where their employees may be located.","length":11355,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[6,8,7,7,9,8,8],"reason":"The article provides a detailed and informative overview of New York State Senate Bill S 5640 (203-F) regarding the redefinition of permissible scope of invention assignment provisions.

How Does It Work?","byline":"manisha","excerpt":"The present article answers what is Perpetual Protocol, how it works, including the benefits and risks of using the platform.","textContent":"The advent of Ethereum blockchain gave rise to many decentralized applications from DEXs and NFTs to blockchain-based games and metaverse projects. Perpetual Protocol is one of those projects built on Ethereum to offer perpetual futures decentralized exchange services to users.\nbringing a new facet to Ethereum’s capabilities, Perpetual protocol offers the same services as other DEXs but instead of involving real world assets, it interacts with perpetual contracts. Let us learn more about what is Perpetual Protocol and how it works in the present article.\n \t Perpetual Protocol is a decentralized exchange platform that allows users to trade perpetual futures contracts. While the pioneering DEXs like Uniswap allows you to trade cryptocurrencies and stablecoins with the help of automated market-makers, Perpetual Protocol relies on virtual automated market-makers (vAMM) to offer perpetual future contracts trading.\n \t In general, futures contracts are the agreements between two parties to buy or sell an asset when its price reaches a predetermined price by predetermined time. When it comes to perpetual futures contracts, they will not have any specific settlement dates and are held infinitely. The Perpetual Protocol allows users to trade these types of contracts in a decentralized manner.\n \t As we mentioned previously, Perpetual Protocol works based on a virtual automated market-making model (vAMM). In the case of DEXs that enable crypto trading, liquidity pools exist which hold funds in pairs of cryptocurrencies and make the trading of those coins simple. Since the Perpetual Protocol contains vAMMs, its liquidity pools hold assets like vETH (virtual ETH), vDAI (virtual DAI), etc. These funds contain a predetermined ratio set by the vAMM operator beforehand.\nLet us understand how vAMMs work in detail. Users first deposit and lock some funds into the vAMM pool for perpetual contracts. The locked funds ensure that there is enough liquidity to cater to traders. To determine the price of perpetual future contracts, vAMMs depend on a constant product formula so that the product of the underlying asset’s price and liquidity in the pool remains constant.\nAdditionally, by allowing users to open long or short trading positions, Perpetual Protocol also offers to borrow funds for trading. This is a part of leverage trading and involves collaterals to cover any potential loss. Another important factor to highlight is the funding mechanism of the  Perpetual Protocol. It ensures price stability, regular settlements of long or short positions, and no discrepancies between perpetual future contracts price and market prices.\n \t Being one-of-its-kind perpetual future contracts trading platform, Perpetual Protocol brings multiple advantages with it. Its decentralized nature combined with leveraged trading options allow traders to make the most of their trades.\nDecentralization – Since Perpetual Protocol is a decentralized exchange, no central authority has power over it. Adding to that, there is no single point of failure, ensuring the security of the platform. It further promotes transparency and censorship resistance.\nNon-custodial Nature – Since it is a decentralized platform and no one is there to control or monitor what is happening on the platform, it gives users complete custody of their funds. It is similar to how non-custodial wallets give complete ownership and freedom to users to access their funds.\nLeveraged Trading – Leveraged trading helps traders to amplify whatever they could make in normal trading. While this is definitely an advantage when it comes to users making profits, it can also amplify losses in cases when the market prices move in opposite directions.\nDeep Liquidity – vAMMs used by the Perpetual Protocol give deep liquidity for trading compared to usual AMMs. As a result, they reduce slippage and allow smooth trading of perpetual future contracts.\n \t Similar to any other decentralized platform, the Perpetual Protocol also has some inherent risks. Let us have a look at them here so that you can prepare beforehand on how to avoid them.\nHigh Volatility – The crypto market is known for its extreme volatile nature. It also increases further when it comes to leveraged trading of these assets.\nSmart Contract Risk – Any decentralized finance (DeFi) platform works based on smart contracts on blockchain networks, including Perpetual protocol. So, there is a possibility of smart contract risk such as bugs and exploits.\nLiquidation Risk – Collaterals are an important part of leveraged trading. When the value of your collateral falls below a certain threshold for any reason, there is a chance that your trading position will be liquidated. The liquidation risk could result in significant losses.\nOverall, Perpetual Protocol is a unique DEX that offers perpetual futures contracts trading services. It presents massive opportunities to traders by offering leveraging trading options. However, traders must keep in mind that leveraged trading amplifies both profits and losses. You must research and understand decentralized platforms thoroughly before using them and involving your funds.\n Perpetual Protocol brings unique applications to the industry and is going on an uptrend as of March 2024. With the anticipation of the upcoming bull market, PERP can be a good investment to make. However, do your own research and understand your risk appetite before investing in PERP. \n Yenwen Feng and Shao-Kang Lee are the founders of Perpetual Protocol DEX. \n PERP tokens can be used to access the services of Perpetual Protocol. Token holders can also stake PERP tokens and earn staking rewards.","length":7505,"publishedTime":"2024-03-06T18:35:13+00:00","rating":[7,7,8,6,8,8,7],"reason":[{"Accuracy":"The article provides accurate information about Perpetual Protocol, explaining its concept, decentralized exchange services, perpetual futures contracts, vAMMs, liquidity pools, leverage trading, and risks associated with the platform."},{"Objectivity":"The article maintains a balanced perspective, presenting the features, advantages, and risks of Perpetual Protocol without significant bias or personal opinion interfering with the presentation of facts."},{"Clarity and Coherence":"The structure and organization of the article are clear, making it easy to follow the explanation of how Perpetual Protocol works and its unique applications in the industry."},{"Depth of Analysis":"The article delves into the workings of Perpetual Protocol, including vAMMs, leverage trading, funding mechanisms, advantages, risks, and the founders, providing a comprehensive overview for readers."},{"Language and Presentation":"The language used is clear and concise, with proper grammar, spelling, and formatting, enhancing the overall presentation of the article."},{"Readability":"The article is well-written, with a good balance of technical information and readability, making it accessible to both cryptocurrency enthusiasts and novices."},{"Attractive":"The article engages readers with its insightful explanation of Perpetual Protocol, leveraging trading opportunities, advantages of decentralized platforms, risks, and the importance of research before investing."}],"conclusion":1},{"lang":"en","siteName":"The Texas Tribune","link":"https://www.texastribune.org/2024/03/07/texas-el-paso-migrant-shelter-investigation-hearing-judge/","title":"El Paso judge says he’s concerned that Ken Paxton has “ulterior political motives”’ in migrant shelter probe","byline":"Uriel J.

Dominguez interrupted Ryan Baasch, a Texas assistant attorney general, during his closing arguments to dispute the state’s characterization of its investigation.\n Baasch said the case has unnecessarily escalated and the documents the state has asked for are “innocuous material.” He said state officials have offered to negotiate with Annunciation House.\n “This is the part where you’re starting to offend my intelligence. You did not offer to negotiate. You did not offer to act in good faith,” Dominguez interrupted Baasch from the bench.\n Dominguez continued by saying that Paxton’s office was “rude and unprofessional” when it made its demands for Annunciation House’s documents. He said that from “day one all I’ve heard is a willingness to comply” from Annuncaition House “so that everyone’s interests are protected.\n “There was no attempt whatsoever to negotiate by the attorney general, which is what gives the court rise for concern that there are ulterior political motives here taking place that go outside of what the law requires, go outside of what the law demands,” Dominguez added.\n Baasch responded by saying the state’s request for the documents “may seem to impose a significant burden” on Annunciation House but that state law requires a quick response.\n Dominguez said that he would make a ruling on whether Annunciation House has to release the specific records the state is asking for as soon as possible.\n In early February, Paxton’s office sent three lawyers to Annunciation House, seeking records about the shelter’s clients and gave the shelter director, Ruben Garcia, a day to turn over the documents. When Garcia’s lawyer, Jerome Wesevich, responded that it wasn’t enough time and asked a judge to determine which documents shelter officials are legally allowed to release, the AG’s office interpreted the delay as noncompliance and filed a countersuit to shut down the shelter network.\n In court documents, the attorney general’s office has said Annunciation House appears “to be engaged in the business of human smuggling,” operating an “illegal stash house” and encouraging immigrants to enter the country illegally because it provides education on legal services.\n Wesevich told Dominguez during the hearing that Garcia has already turned over 200 pages of documents but that the state’s request is “an abuse of power to try to stop Annunciation House from doing business.”\n Among the documents the state is seeking are logs of the names of people the shelter has provided services to, a grant application the shelter has filed with the federal government, material it has provided to migrants and a list of all the shelters Garcia operates.\n Garcia said during the court hearing that he is willing to comply with the attorney general’s request but wants a judge to decide which documents he is legally obligated to release. He said he is hesitant to release all the documents the state is asking for because it includes sensitive information such as medical records and the identifying information of migrants who have told them are fleeing people trying to harm them.\n During questioning, Baasch asked Garcia if he was aware of the killing of 22-year-old Laken Hope Riley, an Augusta University nursing student in Georgia. Baasch also asked Garcia if he knew that the suspected killer, 26-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra — a Venezulan who immigration officials said entered the country near El Paso in September 2022 — had stayed at an Annunciation House shelter.\n Garcia said he is aware of the case but doesn’t know if Ibarra may have stayed at one of his shelters.\n The Attorney General’s Office didn’t respond to an email from The Texas Tribune seeking additional information about any links between the Georgia murder and Annunciation House.\n After the court hearing, Garcia said he lost a son to cancer and feels heartache for Riley’s family. But he said he finds it sad whenever someone implies that all “refugees are the same.”\n “If you take one individual from any demographic group and then try to paint the entire group as a result of the behavior of that one individual, [that’s] unconscionable,” Garcia said to reporters after the hearing.\n For the past few years, right-wing advocacy groups and Republican lawmakers have targeted non-governmental organizations that shelter migrants, many of them asylum seekers, blaming them for incentivizing illegal immigration with taxpayer money.\n Those efforts come as religious figures, emboldened by the rise of Christian nationalism, continue to demonize migrants and those who aid them as part of a broader scheme to dilute the American electorate.\n Annunciation House operates several shelters in El Paso, helping immigrants and refugees obtain food and housing, and providing information on how to complete legal documents to claim asylum in the United States.\n The nonprofit, which opened its first shelter at a local Catholic Church nearly 50 years ago and receives support from the church, said it has helped hundreds of thousands of refugees who have come through El Paso by feeding and keeping them off city streets.\n We can’t wait to welcome you to downtown Austin Sept. 5-7 for the 2024 Texas Tribune Festival!

At $1,600, is it worth getting one for yourself?\nFor as long as digital art applications like Photoshop have existed, companies have created drawing tablets. With the growth of devices like the iPad Pro and Galaxy Tab S9, however, many customers have found themselves investing in fully-fledged computers that incorporate robust tablet elements.\nThis is where the Huion Kamvas Studio 16 comes in. The company has taken its existing knowledge of making high-quality drawing tablets and applied it to a full-fledged computer akin to the Microsoft Surface.Article continues after ad\nBut at $1,600, is it worth getting one for yourself? After weeks of testing the pen-equipped computer, I’m still not sure how to feel about it.\nThe Huion Kamvas Studio 16’s design is quite simple, but its simplicity is one of the pen computer’s redeeming factors. Akin to the Microsoft Surface lineup of tablet PCs, the Huion tablet is silver around the back and sides with thick, black bezels on the front. \nIt sports an iPhone-like squared-off design, with two USB-C ports on the left and a 3.5mm headphone jack on the right. You’ll also find that the speakers are placed on the side of the tablet, which sound great.Article continues after ad\nAt the top, you’ll find the power button, which also acts as a fingerprint sensor for easy login to Windows 11. There are front and rear cameras with middling quality, but they’re plenty suitable for quick video calls on Zoom and Discord.\nBeing that this is a drawing-focused tablet PC, Huion has offered more than enough options to make sure you’re super comfortable when using it. There’s a full-length metal kickstand across the back of the 16″ tablet, and Huion has also included a separate stand. Article continues after ad\nMany devices with built-in kickstands have questionable support, but the heavy-duty hinges on the Kamvas Studio 16 feel like they can withstand your whole body weight without buckling.\nThe included stand is much of the same, although it’s constructed of a fair bit more plastic than I’d like to have seen. It’s easy to take out and set on my desk, and especially comes in handy when I want to use the Kamvas Studio 16 in portrait mode.Article continues after ad\nHuion has included its battery-free PW550S slim pen as well, and it comes in a high-quality case that will protect it from just about anything. It’s slim, and super comfortable to hold, and the two buttons on the side are easily programmable through the company’s included software.\nThe screen does have super thick bezels, which might turn off a handful of potential customers. It’s extremely handy having the freedom to grab ahold of the Kamvas Studio 16 around every edge, though, as it’s a wonderful way to prevent accidentally interacting with the computer.Article continues after ad\nBeing that Huion is known for its drawing tablets, it’s no surprise that the Kamvas Studio 16 is chock full of high-quality features for artists to enjoy. \nThey’ve opted for a 1440p anti-glare IPS panel in the Kamvas Studio 16, and it looks wonderful. The pixel density is great for a screen this size, and I was able to see more of the canvas as I was doodling with the pen in Photoshop.\nThe included pen is the star of the show here, as a stylus can make or break the value of something like this tablet. It supports 8192 levels of pressure sensitivity, 60-degree tilt recognition, and of course, doesn’t need to be charged. Article continues after ad\nHuion’s software is preinstalled out of the box and offers quite a few options for those looking to fine-tune their experience.Subscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.\nAcross four menus, the software offers screen calibration and pressure sensitivity adjustment as well as the ability to program the two buttons on the side of the included pen. It’s easy to figure out right out of the box, and runs in the background taking up very little resources in the process.Article continues after ad\nI used the Huion Kamvas Studio 16 with Photoshop on Windows 11, testing its accuracy, latency, and responsiveness. \nThe results were unsurprising, given Huion’s history in high-quality drawing tablets. There were no noticeable issues with the pen inside of Photoshop and I’d even say it’s better than the Zagg Pro Stylus that I use with my 10th Gen iPad. \nI loaded up a few quite large PSD files that I had handy to test out how it would handle them, and I had zero issues with Photoshop, or the PC in general lagging or freezing with the added load. For just art, the specs used for the Huion Kamvas Studio 16 are great.Article continues after ad\nHuion’s Kamvas Studio 16 runs Windows 11 an 11th-generation Intel Core i7 CPU with integrated graphics and 16 GB of DDR4 RAM, which is quite honestly a bit disappointing. The company advertises the tablet as a multi-purpose device that can be used with an external keyboard and mouse alongside its drawing tablet capabilities.\nThe Core i7-1165G7 has only four cores and eight threads, meaning that multitasking capabilities with the Kamvas Studio 16 take a massive hit with the nearly four-year-old CPU. I really would have liked to see something newer being used here. Article continues after ad\nEven if Huion opted for only one generation newer, they could have used an Intel Core i5-12450H and significantly helped the overall multitasking capabilities of the Kamvas Studio 16.\nHaving just 16GB of DDR4 RAM in the pen computer doesn’t help with its multitasking capabilities either, but it should be suitable for most users. It’s the CPU that really holds it back.\nThere’s no doubt that the Huion Kamvas Studio 16 fills a unique niche in the tablet market. It allows artists to disconnect from their existing PC and offers a large 16-inch high-resolution screen with a battery-free pen that’s both high quality and cheap to replace if needed.Article continues after ad\nIf you’re one of the few who are in the market for something of its size, you should definitely check out the Huion Kamvas Studio 16. If you’re looking for a hybrid tablet that you can use for drawing, video games, office work, and general multitasking, you should just pick up a 12-inch iPad Pro M2 with a second-gen Apple Pencil.\nThe Huion Kamvas Studio 16 is a great drawing tablet with a wonderful build quality that will suit every digital artist’s needs. That is, assuming you want something bigger than the 12″ iPad Pro and don’t mind paying a premium to fill a rather niche need.Article continues after ad\nHuion markets it as “an ideal portable pen computer for today’s hybrid work situation,” but doesn’t give it the specs needed to make it worth buying for those use cases. \nIf you click on a product link on this page we may earn a small affiliate commission.","length":7419,"publishedTime":"2024-02-15T14:59:40.000Z","rating":[5,6,7,6,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides a detailed overview of the Huion Kamvas Studio 16, highlighting its design, features, performance, and drawbacks.

It should be fun. There’s a lot of dudes in here.”Birdsong, 22, is in the midst of his first big league camp with the Giants, but he’s found himself in familiar company, as he’s part of a cluster of young pitching prospects who are now occupying a row of lockers in the Scottsdale Stadium clubhouse.Birdsong and one of his locker neighbors, Carson Whisenhunt, were part of the Giants’ pitcher-heavy Draft class in 2022, and each reached Double-A Richmond last year. Birdsong, a sixth-round pick out of Eastern Illinois, said he found it beneficial to begin his pro career alongside a big group of pitchers because they’ve all been able to lean on each other from the start.“I would say it’s helped a lot, especially because I’ve grown close to my Draft class,” Birdsong said. “We were in Arizona for a month, and it was just us. It was us and some of the younger Latin kids. We got really close and learned about each other and learned each other’s pitches and all that stuff. We’ve all moved pretty similarly together. Everybody was in [Single-A] San Jose at the same time. We played really well. We all got really close.”Birdsong recorded a 3.31 ERA over 28 appearances (25 starts) between Single-A San Jose, High-A Eugene and Double-A Richmond in 2023, so his goal is to break into the Giants’ starting rotation at some point this year. He fired a scoreless inning in his Cactus League debut against the Cubs, though he stumbled a bit in his next outing against the Rangers, yielding two runs on four hits over 1 2/3 innings.Birdsong’s mid-90s fastball and sharp breaking ball are already considered plus pitches, but he said he's still working on developing a good feel for his changeup this spring.“I’m trying to figure out my changeup, try to get that thing in the zone as much as I can,” Birdsong said. “It’s not going to be my [No. 1] or [No. 2] pitch in my repertoire, but I want it to where I can throw it at least 10 to 15 percent of the time and be in the zone and basically use it. Last year, I never used it, so this year I want it to be where I can use it all the time and keep people off balance.”How to tune in: MLB Digital (MLB.TV, MLB.com, MLB App), NBC Sports California, ESPN+, GamedayWhat is Spring Breakout?

Jim Carrey plays the introverted Joel whose relationship with eccentric Clementine (Kate Winslet) has fallen apart. As the film reveals, Joel has undergone a process offered by the elusive Lacuna Inc. to erase Clementine from his memory and allow him to move on. While Joel undergoes the process of erasure, he journeys back through the timeline of his relationship, ultimately regretting his decision to forget both the treasured and tormenting memories of his former partner. Kaufman’s screenplay is a mastery of genre-blending, delicately balancing the film’s emotional core with its more farcical sci-fi plot points.\nSince Eternal Sunshine’s release, technology has become irrevocably bound up with our experiences of modern romance. Instant messaging has enabled couples to sustain their relationships across long distances, forming connections on digital platforms that keep records of each conversation. The evolution and increased popularity of dating apps such as Tinder and Hinge has transformed the dating landscape, widely increasing the accessibility of romantic prospects for their patrons. These apps offer a compacted version of dating, as the multiplex components of a real person are reduced to a few snapshots upon which the app offers an ultimatum: left or right, match or no match.\nIn many ways, the advent of these apps has enhanced the modern dating experience, broadening the scope of an otherwise limited dating pool and providing exciting new opportunities for connection. But while technology has advanced to assist the forming of new relationships, we are yet to create mechanisms that, like the fictional Lacuna Inc. of Eternal Sunshine, can help us erase them. Our phones, so intricately weaved into the fabric of our lives, are pocket-sized containers of the components of our relationships. Yes, we can go through the motions of erasure by deleting photos, blocking numbers or wiping messages. Despite these attempts, however, technology has not yet evolved to navigate the complex maze of emotion and subjectivity that make up human memory.\nAs Eternal Sunshine reminds us, remembrance is a powerful tool. When Joel makes the decision to erase Clementine from his memory, he does so out of anger and pain. Technology offers him a permanent solution that many of us would leap at if given the opportunity. But as the film so beautifully demonstrates, the passionate anger which prompts his decision is born out of love, and Joel’s journey back through his own memories allows him to remember why he and Clementine were together in the first place.\n“Eternal Sunshine reminds us that sometimes it is the challenging introspections that can teach us the most”\nLike many real-life technologies, Lacuna sells itself as a quick fix solution, exploiting the depth of emotion that the human mind is capable of to present the appeal of a blank slate – the spotless mind. It is far easier to suppress or erase entire relationships than it is to process the pain and grief that accompanies the loss of a break-up.\nA quick scour of current social media trends reveals the popular phrase ‘no contact’ that encompasses the easy access technology offers to completely eliminate ex-partners or ex-friends. Contemporary rhetoric stresses the importance of ‘moving on’– there’s boundless pressure to throw yourself into your ‘single era’, find a ‘rebound’ or build a ‘roster’. Equally, social media encourages the total obliteration of any evidence of an ex-partner with self-help content advertising techniques such as deleting all photos and messages. Much like the procedure undertaken by Joel to eradicate memories of places, songs and souvenirs that remind him of Clementine, an ex in 2024 is little more than the digital footprint they leave behind. And we’re all too aware that this evidence of their existence can be removed without a trace.\nOne Lacuna employee quotes Nietzsche to justify the company’s service: “Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders.” Forgetfulness can indeed be a blessing and moving on is a necessary step towards embracing a brighter future. But what Eternal Sunshine demonstrates is that this process is never linear or simple. For Joel, his memories of Clementine allow him to see the beauty of their past relationship even after it has crumbled. As he undergoes the procedure to remove Clementine from his brain, he realises how desperately he wants to remember her. Their inexplicable bond remains after the erasure process: even as complete strangers the lovers are drawn to each other once again. Their ending highlights the necessity of memory, no matter how desperately or proudly we may try to run from it.\nThe creative blend of romance and science fiction tropes within Eternal Sunshine speaks to the complicated nature of our relationship with love and technology and feels all the more relevant twenty years after its release. While it is unlikely that memory-erasure will become the post-break-up cure-all of our generation, it’s worth asking how far technology has already succeeded in overriding the difficult experiences that come with being a human maintaining human relationships. Already technology categorises our relationships into simple yet terminal tasks – block or unblock, follow or unfollow, keep or delete. Eternal Sunshine reminds us that sometimes it is the challenging introspections that can teach us the most, and this is a process that technology can never authentically replicate.\nVarsity is the independent newspaper for the University of Cambridge, established in its current form in 1947.

Inc. launched today with a new central processing unit that it claims is up to 100 times more energy-efficient than leading general-purpose CPUs.\nThe company also said it raised a $16 million seed funding round led by Eclipse Ventures LLC.\nEfficient Compute’s Fabric architecture technology is based on foundational research conducted at Carnegie Mellon University and documented in a set of papers on its website. The technical details require an advanced degree in computer science to understand, but the core principles come down to eliminating much of the energy-consuming overhead of general-purpose CPU operations.\n“CPUs have been optimized for performance first, often at the detriment of energy efficiency,” said Brandon Lucia, co-founder and chief executive of Efficient Computer and a CMU electrical and computer engineering professor, told SiliconANGLE. “They spend a lot of time with that instructions for memory figuring out how many operations they can run at the same time.” That enhances performance but at the expense of power consumption.\nEfficient’s architecture eliminates much of that overhead by moving decisions about parallel processing to its purpose-built compiler and using spatial parallelism. That’s a method of executing different instructions at the same physical time but in different locations on the processor.\nIt also uses a simple onboard network to connect parallel processing elements that’s “about as efficient as it’s possible to be,” Lucia said. “It’s essentially just wires connecting two points in a range of parallel processing elements. It doesn’t get much more efficient than that.” The design makes the chipset somewhat larger than a standard CPU but with comparable performance thanks to optimized compilation.\nThe compiler is critical to the design’s energy efficiency. Lucie said it can ingest C, C++, Tensorflow and some Rust applications using Multi-Level Intermediate Representation, a unified software framework for compiler development. That enables many existing applications to run on the Fabric architecture without modification.\n“It’s in the interest of anyone who makes a language or a framework for machine learning, signal processing or whatever to make a little adaptation layer that goes from their front end into MLIR,” Lucia said. “We benefit from that basically for free.”\nThe compiler creates an intermediate representation of a program that models the structure of the underlying hardware. “We have a series of steps called lowering, where we move the representation closer and closer to what is physically implemented in the chip,” he said. “Along the way, we restructure the data flow graph representation of the program to further reduce the amount of energy it consumes once we map it onto the fabric.”\nLucia said target markets include industrial internet of things devices, infrastructure monitoring and wearables. He said many of the limitations of current devices are the result of power consumption issues requiring frequent round-trips to the cloud or precluding smart device use altogether.\n“If you could scale deployments with smart devices, you could do so much more with machine learning at the edge,” he said. “A lot of industrial infrastructure monitoring currently doesn’t make sense because you need to swap batteries every few months. You can go from months to years of battery time.”\nThe chipset is currently in “tape-out,” a design term that marks the completion of design and the start of manufacturing. Efficient Compute has contracts with application vendors it wouldn’t name and expects to ship production versions to customers in early 2025.\nYour vote of support is important to us and it helps us keep the content FREE.\nOne click below supports our mission to provide free, deep, and relevant content.  \nJoin the community that includes more than 15,000 #CubeAlumni experts, including Amazon.com CEO Andy Jassy, Dell Technologies founder and CEO Michael Dell, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and many more luminaries and experts.\n“TheCUBE is an important partner to the industry.

Policymakers and economists therefore need to understand not only how overall inflation is evolving, but what is driving it. Knowing why inflation changes in any given month requires looking beyond the headline number.\nAlong these lines, the San Francsico Fed releases a number of indicators that help disentangle the key drivers of personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation each month, including supply and demand factors and cyclical and acyclical components.\nTo help further explore these drivers, we have launched a new data page, called PCE Inflation Contributions from Goods and Services. This page breaks down each inflation reading into the different groups of goods and services that contribute to it. \nThis analysis allows us to see, for example, how much of inflation is coming from key categories of consumer spending, such as housing, food, and energy. Figure 1 shows that food and energy (light blue bars) and core goods (yellow bars), such as cars and furniture, contributed a significant amount to inflation in the summer of 2022.\nNote: Gray bar indicates NBER recession dates. Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis and authors’ calculations.\nIn contrast, the latest inflation reading from January 2024 shows that the total contribution of these categories to the 12-month, or year-over-year, change in inflation is close to zero. This means that current inflation is being driven almost entirely by services such as health care, transportation, accommodations, and housing rents.\nIn addition to the current data charts available on the new page, PCE Inflation Contributions from Goods and Services provides historical inflation breakdowns in a downloadable data file, giving users the ability to analyze key inflation drivers over time. It also breaks the larger categories down into more detailed components.\nFor example, Figure 2 uses historical data to show how non-housing services inflation, sometimes referred to as supercore inflation, and its subcomponents evolved over the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) starting in 2007. Financial services inflation (green bars) declined substantially in late 2008, helping to pull supercore inflation (black line) down to zero by mid-2009.  Financial services inflation then recovered in 2010, pushing supercore inflation closer to levels observed before the crisis began.\nNote:  Gray bar indicates NBER recession dates. Supercore services refer to all services excluding energy and housing services. Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis and authors’ calculations.\nIn recent months, although supercore inflation has moderated significantly, it remains well above its post-GFC and pre-pandemic levels. Health-care services and food services and accommodations are currently the largest contributors to inflation in this category.\nThe new Data and Indicators page will be updated monthly shortly following the PCE data release, which is part of the Personal Income and Outlays Release of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\nThe views expressed here do not necessarily reflect the views of the management of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco or of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.Aren S.

But how do the books differ from the films, and which of the source material or the adaptation work better?","textContent":"It's a good year for literary adaptations in the Best Picture category. But how do the books differ from the films, and which of the source material or the adaptation work better?\n It’s World Book Day.Happy World Book Day. That is, if you’re in the UK and Ireland.The UNESCO World Book Day is officially set for 23 April 2024 - the anniversary of William Shakespeare, Miguel Cervantes and Inca Garcilaso de la Vega’s deaths. But the UK always have to do things differently, and launched their own “World” Book Day on the first Thursday of March. Good for them.With this in mind, I’m pivoting slightly and taking a look at this year’s Oscar Best Picture slate.You see, Hollywood loves to mine literature as source material for its films, and this year’s Best Picture nominees show the habit is front and centre.Five of the 10 Best Pictures are based on books - three novels and two works of historical nonfiction. That’s significantly more than previous years, and serves as a reminder that a film’s success always comes back to words on a page. Without writers and scriptwriters, there wouldn’t be much to watch or celebrate in the seventh art. Films need directors and actors; they’re made in the editing room; but whether original or adapted, they originate from the page.Having watched all the Oscar nominated films this year, I’ve also taken it upon myself to read the source material for all the literary nominees, to better fashion a guide which will allow you to impress your friends when discussing the films. Or look like a pretentious git desperate for validation, attempting to justify your credentials as a so-called culture vulture by boring the pants off your loved ones. Whatever.I'm proceeding alphabetically – not by order of recommendation. Although the first one is a doozy...American FictionOscar nominated for? Best Picture, Best Actor (Jeffrey Wright), Best Supporting Actor (Sterling K. Brown), Adapted Screenplay, Original Score.Based on? The 2001 novel “Erasure” by Percival Everett.What’s it about? The Pulitzer Prize finalist follows frustrated novelist-professor Thelonious \"Monk\" Ellison, whose agent tells him that publishing houses don't believe his writing to be \"Black enough\". Out of frustration for the success of a novel called \"We's Lives In Da Ghetto\", he writes an outlandish caricature of stereotypical \"Black\" books called \"My Pafology\" (before changing the title to \"Fuck\"). The twist is that his satirical “ghetto novel” is mistaken by the liberal elite for “serious literature”. It gets published, rakes up both critical praise and high sales, and he becomes an overnight literary darling.Worth a read? Absolutely. If the award for Best Picture was dished out in terms of the source material, American Fiction would win. The book, like the film, not only delves into the fallout of turning art into a commodity and the US’ racial contradictions, but also has a poignancy to it. Monk has to navigate the way that publishers and readers value dysfunctional and clichéd narratives, and how writers are pigeonholed; this is mirrored in the audacious structure, as the novel “Fuck” is published in its entirety within \"Erasure\", thereby creating a fascinating meta-narrative. The character also deals with his family tragedies, including his father’s suicide and his aging mother’s Alzheimer's. The way these strands interweave make “Erasure” a scathing comedy of errors, a brilliant exploration of race, class, family and sex, as well as a subtly devastating novel.Which is better - book or movie? It’s a faithful adaptation, but the experimental book wins this one.Killers of the Flower MoonOscar nominated for? Best Picture, Best Director (Martin Scorsese), Best Actress (Lily Gladstone), Best Supporting Actor (Robert De Niro), Production Design, Costume Design, Cinematography, Editing, Original Score, Original Song (“Wahzhazhe (A Song For My People)”).Based on? “Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI” by David Grann.What’s it about? The book investigates one of the most chilling conspiracies in US history: a series of murders of wealthy Osage people that took place in Osage County, Oklahoma, in the early 1920s - after big oil deposits were discovered beneath their land. What initially appeared as a series of isolated killings is soon revealed a calculated plot to exploit the wealth of the Osage people. This riveting book uncovers this complex web of corruption, and details the newly formed FBI's investigation of the murders.Worth a read? Yes, but brace yourself. It’s dense and harrowing – not a breezy sit-down, this one. Systematic exploitation and slow genocide await. It’s a thorough and meticulously researched recording of a forgotten chapter in American history, one that exposes the rotten foundations of a country and its proud nationhood. It’s clearly written by a diligent journalist, and while there are differences between the book and the film (Scorsese’s three-and-a-half-hour epic only focuses on the first two sections of the book; the time spent on the FBI’s perspective is absent and attention is shifted more towards the perpetrators), Scorsese matches the book’s epic scope. If you enjoyed the film, this is a must-read. And if you were put off by Scorsese’s lengthy effort, Grann’s book is genuinely compelling and will hook you from the get-go.Which is better - book or movie? Two for two - the book reigns supreme. OppenheimerOscar nominated for? Best Picture, Best Director (Christopher Nolan), Best Actor (Cillian Murphy), Best Supporting Actor (Robert Downey Jr.), Best Supporting Actress (Emily Blunt), Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Costume Design, Cinematography, Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Sound.Based on? “American Prometheus: The Triumph And Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer” by Kai Bird and Martin Sherwin.What’s it about? This 2005 biography chronicles all things J. Robert Oppenheimer, predominantly focusing on his studies, his role as the founder of the theoretical physics program at Berkeley, his direction of the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II, and his eventual fall from grace due to his 1954 security hearing. Told over five parts sandwiched by a prologue and an epilogue, Parts 4 and 5 are arguably the most interesting, detailing the Trinity Test and the security hearings in the McCarthy era.Worth a read? This twenty-five-years-in-the-making biography is vast and frequently overwhelming in its detail. Like David Grann’s “Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI”, it is meticulously researched and quite the achievement. Although Christopher Nolan faithfully depicts the same chronicling of rise and fall of “the father of the atomic bomb”, it has to be said that the film is far more engaging than the book, which tends to feel like homework. The book compellingly starts with Oppenheimer’s funeral, and is fascinating in the way it tackles the various components of a complex character, not shying away from his life outside the Manhattan Project – specifically his shortcomings. The epilogue, which covers the lives of Oppenheimer's family and children after his death, is quite moving, and while very educational, this is probably the hardest book to recommend in this five-strong list.Which is better - book or movie? Movie, without a doubt.Poor ThingsOscar nominated for? Best Picture, Best Director (Yorgos Lanthimos), Best Actress (Emma Stone), Best Supporting Actor (Mark Ruffalo), Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Costume Design, Cinematography, Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score.Based on? “Poor Things: Episodes from the Early Life of Archibald McCandless M.D., Scottish Public Health Officer” by Alasdair Gray.What’s it about? 1880s Glasgow. A medical student, Archibald McCandless, finds himself enchanted with Bella Baxter. Supposedly the product of the fiendish scientist Godwin Baxter (because he’s not as benevolent in the film as he is in the book), Bella was resurrected from the dead to fulfil the whims of her benefactor. McCandless’ desire turns to obsession, and Bella elopes with a rakish lawyer, Duncan Wedderburn, with whom she embarks on a hedonistic odyssey.Worth a read? Very much so. Unlike the film, “Poor Things” wasn’t originally all from Bella’s perspective. The 1992 novel is a denser beast, with a structure meaning that our lead protagonist’s story is told in contradictory ways by several men. Gray utilises various literary devices – including various journal entries, fictious historical documents, letters, portraits, anatomy drawings – a process described by the author as “multi-modal”. This leads to questioning the reliability of the narrators, considering truth distortion, as well as putting reader interpretation at the heart of the reading experience. Poor Things strives for more clarity compared to Gray’s elaborate narrative, and the ending in particular is wildly different from the film’s. Spoiler: We understand that McCandless has created a life for Bella inspired by the prevailing gothic motifs of the period – thereby confirming the tale’s echoes of Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\" - and that what we thought to be true is in fact a likely fantasia. Like Killers of the Flower Moon, both the film and the source material are fascinating to consider in tandem, and will lead you to further appreciate what Yorgos Lanthimos and scriptwriter Tony McNamara have achieved. But if you think you can skip the novel because you’ve seen the film, think again.Which is better - book or movie? It’s a tie, as both work individually and as a parallel works. Title wise though, we're glad it was curtailed, as Poor Things: Episodes from the Early Life of Archibald McCandless MD, Scottish Public Health Officer would have been a mouthful. The Zone of InterestOscar nominated for? Best Picture, Best Director (Jonathan Glazer), Adapted Screenplay, Sound, International Feature.Based on? \"The Zone of Interest\" by Martin Amis.What’s it about? The 2014 novel by the late British author sees the narrative rotate among three main characters. There’s Paul Doll, a drunken camp commandant; SS-Obersturmführer Thomsen, who is having an affair with Doll's wife; and Szmul Zacharias, a member of the camp’s Sonderkommando (one of the Jewish prisoners charged with disposing of bodies). These three narrative threads create a portrait of Auschwitz and the “zone of interest” - the Nazi euphemism for the death camp.Worth a read? Certainly, but be warned: Of the five Oscar nominated films for Best Picture, this book is the most distant from the film you see on screen. The Zone of Interest is only loosely based on Amis’ novel, so both works are very different experiences. Amis’ “The Zone of Interest” serves as the basis for Jonathan Glazer's film. The author premised his novel on the Hösses, a real Nazi family who lived within the \"zone of interest\". Glazer's adaptation dispenses with the other characters to better shift focus to the Höss family. While there are definite traces of Amis’ novel in Glazer’s film, the two almost feel at odds: the book is a historical fiction that has elements of dark humour, while that’s the last thing that can be said about the film – especially with those emotionally punishing final moments. Tonally and conceptually, the film is more complex and less sleazy at times than the black comedy satire of the source material. Which is better - book or movie? The movie gets this one - Glazer crafted a more oppressive and impactful work.This year’s Academy Awards take place on Sunday 10 March.

The new battery adapter also allows for the “use of any industry-standard V-mount battery to be used to power an RT for approximately eight hours or more, depending on battery size/capacity.” In addition, the PAC-RTM-SMU universal RT mount was developed for maximum adaptability and flexibility, as it supports Manfrotto-style Hex, 1/4″-20, 5/8″-27 and 3/8″-16 mount thread sizes.","length":2577,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T10:44:21-05:00","rating":[8,7,7,6,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides detailed information about Pliant Technologies' new PHS-IEHU Miniature In-Ear Headset, including its features, accessories, connectivity options, and power solutions.

Liz Smith chose to continue with her pregnancy but says she has been traumatised by her experience with the medical system.","textContent":"When Liz Smith was 12 weeks pregnant, she found out she would likely have a baby with Down syndrome. She said the assumption made by the medical professionals treating her was that she would terminate her pregnancy.\"They said the chances of baby surviving were slim,\" she said.The average life expectancy for a person with Down syndrome is now around 60 years old, but Ms Smith said she was told if her baby did survive, it would have continuous medical issues and would probably spend most of its life in hospital.\"[I was told] the best option was to terminate,\" she said.It is estimated more than 90 per cent of women who receive a diagnosis during prenatal testing choose to terminate their pregnancies.For personal and religious reasons, Ms Smith decided to continue with her pregnancy and asked for a note to be made in her medical records that she did not want to discuss termination.\"And still every visit, it was brought up,\" she said.\"It would be, 'Let's discuss termination', right up to 30 weeks.\"It continued after her daughter was born.She recalled a hospital staff member inquiring: \"So you've decided to take her home with you?\" as she was leaving with her husband, Tucker.

While NM State has fallen in four straight games, the Aggies could still climb the CUSA leaderboard with a much-needed win. The Crimson & White played their first-ever CUSA home game against FIU over eight weeks ago, falling 57-52. Now, the former Sun Belt foes will swap venues, meeting in Miami for FIU's Senior Day and both sides' final regular-season bout. The Panthers (20-9, 11-4), drummed UTEP at home on Thursday by a score of 88-62, increasing their chances of clinching the league's No. 2 seed. NM State (11-17, 5-10) is aiming to snap its losing skid and head into the CUSA Tournament with momentum and a higher seed.\nWho: NM State (11-17, 5-10 CUSA) at FIU (20-9, 11-4 CUSA) \nLast Meeting: FIU 57 @ NM State 52 (Jan. 11, 2024)\nLast time out, NM State fell at home to Jax State on Senior Day. The Aggies failed to win a quarter, largely due to their continued shooting woes. Molly Kaiser poured in 17 points, but the team mustered up just 51. The home squad missed 22 field goals in the second half as part of a 36.4% showing from the field. The Aggies have now shot below 40% from the floor 10 times in 15 conference games, and have eclipsed 45% in just 3 of their last 18 contests.\nSimply put, the scenarios are nearly endless for NM State's final CUSA seed. With a loss, the Aggies would fall to 5-11, securing the No. 8 seed, having to play an extra game versus Sam Houston on Tuesday, March 12. With a win, NM State could potentially move as high as the No. 6 seed. WKU falling to Liberty would greatly aid the Aggies, likely setting up a three-way tie alongside the Hilltoppers and Miners at 6-10. With that outcome, NM State would hold the best record in the round robin between the three, clinching the top seed among the group (No. 6). \nThe opening moments of games can often foreshadow the result in Aggie games this season. NM State is now 11-2 when on top after 10 minutes, 11-6 when ahead at halftime, and 11-3 with an advantage to start the final frame. For the entire season, the Aggies possess only six losses when leading at any point after the first quarter. \nOn the flip side, Jody Adams' bunch has yet to come back from a single deficit at any quarter break this season. When trailing or tied, the Aggies are now 0-15 after the opening frame, 0-11 at halftime and 0-14 when down or even at the start of the fourth quarter.  \nThe Conference USA schedule has included 68 games through March 7, 2024. Road teams now have a 25-43 record in those games. The conference's top two seeds (Middle Tennessee and FIU) are a combined 13-3 away from home, with one loss being FIU at Middle Tennessee. The league's other seven teams have combined for just 12 road wins in 52 tries. Sam Houston, the league's last-place team, is 2-6 in CUSA home games as part of a 7-20 overall record. \nExcluding home games against MTSU, FIU and road games with Sam Houston, CUSA is collectively 6-38 in 44 contests away from home. NM State has one of those six wins; a 50-44 defensive shutdown of Western Kentucky on Jan. 18. In games outside the Pan American Center, NM State is 4-11, with a 2-10 road record and wins in two of three neutral games. \nThere have been two Aggies to start all 28 games this season. Every opening tip has been taken by Ene Adams, who has put forth a career year. The senior is sinking 52.2 percent of her shots en route to averaging 7.8 points per game in just 22.5 average minutes of action. Adams also paces the Aggies with 148 total rebounds, 58 of which have come on the offensive end. Molly Kaiser has been the other senior in every starting five of 2023-24. The fourth-year Aggie has improved in nearly every offensive statistic from a year prior. Kaiser has twice as many 3-pointers this season (24) than last (12), and has drastically improved her 3-point percentage to 36.5 percent (+10.9). Additionally, the Watauga, Texas native has canned 87.3 percent of her free-throw attempts to bolster her career-high 14.5 points per game. \nWith 1:12 remaining in the third quarter at Middle Tennessee on Jan. 20, Watauga, Texas native Molly Kaiser employed one of her patented moves – driving down the left side of the lane before pulling up for an elbow jumper – burying the shot to give her six points in the quarter. The play held extra significance as it gave Kaiser 1,000 career points, with every bucket coming as a member of the Crimson & White.\nKaiser became the 25th member of the 1,000-point club, and the first since Gia Pack, who played for the Aggies from 2016-2020.\nTransferring in from Butler CC in El Dorado, Kansas, junior guard Jaila Harding has been a spark on offense for the Crimson & White, especially from the 3-point line. Last season, the Aggies ranked 328th in the nation from beyond the arc, shooting just 26.1 percent. Through 28 games in the 2023-24 season, this has jumped to 31.6 percent, while ranking 145th in the nation.\nAmong members with at least 2.0 made deep balls per game, Harding paces the Aggies and is second in CUSA with a 36.9 3-point percentage. The Wichita, Kan. native ranks 78th individually by 3-point percentage and is fourth in the conference with 2.07 made threes per contest.\nFIU is led by fourth-year Head Coach Jesyka Burks-Wiley, who touts a 64-57 record in her time with the program. Mya Kone is the team's leading scorer, pouring in 11.4 points and 8.0 rebounds per night. Courtney Prenger is the only Panther to start 28 games this season, ranking third in points per game (9.0), adding 103 rebounds and 28 assists on the campaign. The Panthers were led by Tanajah Hayes in Las Cruces, who contributed 18 points, three assists and a pair of 3-pointers. Hayes is averaging 10.5 points per game this season, but has improved that number to 14.5 across her past eight games.\nMaria Torres added 16 points (8-for-11 field goals), 6 rebounds and three steals in FIU's win at NM State. The Spanish forward went down with a leg injury on Feb. 15 versus Sam Houston and has not played since. The Panthers, however, have found ways to win despite Torres' absence. In FIU's game on Thursday, the home team soundly defeated UTEP 88-62. The Miners took a 9-0 lead early, but FIU dropped the hammer, scoring 50 points in the next 16 minutes and 11 seconds. 32 second-quarter points put them ahead 50-27 at the break, and the Panthers never looked back. \nFor complete coverage of NM State Women's Basketball, follow us on Twitter (@NMStateWBB), Instagram (@NMStateWBB) and like us on Facebook (NM State Women's Basketball).

However, a queue began to form in front of the municipal housing office on Thursday afternoon.\n“We’ve been here since 7 p.m.,” one woman told broadcaster RMF on Friday morning. “My son took over from me, then a friend, and finally I came [back] at 4 in the morning and will be here until the end.”\nAnother woman joked that she “hadn’t spent the night with so many strangers in a long time”.\nThere was a sense of camaraderie among those in line, with one man saying they had been sharing tea, coffee, food and cigarettes with one another.\nKilkanaście osób przez całą noc stało w kolejce do urzędu miasta, by złożyć wniosek w ramach programu \"Mieszkanie za remont\" w Krakowie.https://t.co/plbw5wPiT2\nThe city’s deputy mayor, Bogusław Kośmider, told broadcaster TVN that there was little sense in queuing overnight because all applications are assessed on an equal basis as long as they are submitted by the final deadline of 29 March.\nHowever, one person in the queue told the TV station that, in cases where two applications are ranked equally, the one submitted first is given priority.\nAsked why applications had to be submitted on paper rather than online, Kośmider said that people need advice on how to fill them in as they often make mistakes.\nPolityka mieszkaniowa @krakow_pl na jednym obrazku.

He handed out tea and sweets to standing in the line.\n“A queue committee has been formed,” he noted, referring to a tradition dating back to communist times, when long lines for everyday products were common and committees were established to maintain order in the queues.\n“This sight is proof of how big the housing crisis is in Kraków,” said Gibała. The cost of rent in Poland grew 62% between 2015 and 2023, which was the fifth-highest rise in the OECD. The EU’s latest figures on house prices show that Poland last year recorded the bloc’s second-highest annual rise.\nEstimates suggest that Poland may have a shortfall of as many as 4 million housing units. That has made entering the market difficult for young Poles, nearly half of whom live with their parents, one of the highest figures in the EU.\nThe cost of rent in Poland has risen 62% since 2015 – the fifth-fastest growth among @OECD countries – with a particular increase after the arrival of Ukrainian refugees.\nBetween 2015 to 2022, the average wage rose 24.5%, far lower than rental increases https://t.co/Ft3qzgNRF7\nKraków’s “Apartment for Renovation” programme allows people to rent an apartment owned by the city for a reduced price of between around 6 zloty to 15 zloty per square metre per month if they agree to renovate it.\nThat is far lower than normal rental prices in the city, which stood at an average of between 51 and 74 zloty (depending on the size of the apartment) in the second quarter of last year, according to industry news service Morator Plus.\nHowever, there are strict requirements to qualify for Kraków’s municipal programme. Successful applicants must already be residents in the city and not own a property. They must also have at least a bachelor’s degree and an average income of between 100% and 300% of the statutory minimum pension.\nKraków first launched the scheme in 2022, when 717 people applied and 50 were successful. The second round saw 972 applications, with 100 of them accepted. By the end of Friday last week, around 350 applications had already been submitted for the new round, Kośmider told TVN.\n#Krakow w marcu będzie można składać wnioski do programu „Mieszkanie za remont”.

Natural gas deliveries to terminals in South Texas fell 6.7% (0.3 Bcf/d), while natural gas deliveries to terminals in South Louisiana fell 2.2% (0.2 Bcf/d) to 8.8 Bcf/d. Ongoing repairs at Freeport LNG in Freeport, Texas resulting from the January 2024 winter storm have reduced sendout capacity from the facility. Natural gas deliveries to terminals outside the Gulf Coast were flat week over week at 1.2 Bcf/d. \n Vessels departing U.S. ports: Twenty-three LNG vessels (eight from Sabine Pass; four each from Cameron and Corpus Christi; three from Calcasieu Pass; two from Cove Point; and one each from Elba Island and Freeport) with a combined LNG-carrying capacity of 87 Bcf departed the United States between February 29 and March 6, according to shipping data provided by Bloomberg Finance, L.P.\n According to Baker Hughes, for the week ending Tuesday, February 27, the natural gas rig count decreased by 1 rig to 119 rigs. The Haynesville dropped two rigs, and the Marcellus added one rig. The number of oil-directed rigs rose by 3 rigs to 506 rigs. The Cana Woodford and Permian both added one rig, and one rig was added among unidentified producing regions. The total rig count, which includes 4 miscellaneous rigs, increased by 3 rigs and stands at 629. \nNet withdrawals from storage totaled 40 Bcf for the week ending March 1, compared with the five-year (2019–2023) average net withdrawals of 93 Bcf and last year's net withdrawals of 72 Bcf during the same week. Working natural gas stocks totaled 2,334 Bcf, which is 551 Bcf (31%) more than the five-year average and 280 Bcf (14%) more than last year at this time.\nAccording to The Desk survey of natural gas analysts, estimates of the weekly net change to working natural gas stocks ranged from net withdrawals of 30 Bcf to 68 Bcf, with a median estimate of 38 Bcf.\nThe average rate of withdrawals from storage is 20% lower than the five-year average so far in the withdrawal season (November through March). If the rate of withdrawals from storage matched the five-year average of 5.0 Bcf/d for the remainder of the withdrawal season, the total inventory would be 2,184 Bcf on March 31, which is 551 Bcf higher than the five-year average of 1,633 Bcf for that time of year. \n \t More storage data and analysis can be found on the Natural Gas Storage Dashboard and the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report. \n *Avg. of NGI's reported prices for: Malin, PG&E Citygate, and Southern California Border Avg.\n Note: This table reflects any data revisions that may have occurred since the previous week's posting.

It was the first visit to China by an African president in 2024.\nOur past research shows that frequent, high-level visits to China by African leaders are often correlated with stronger trade and investment relationships with China. But how exactly does this happen? And will this correlation continue, especially with concerns being expressed internationally about the state of the Chinese economy?\nA closer look at Bio’s visit last week provides some vital clues.\nSierra Leone and China established diplomatic relations on July 29, 1971. Between 2009 and 2024, Sierra Leone’s presidents made six visits to China, above average compared to other African countries. Furthermore, a mere 10 months ago, Sierra Leone’s foreign minister, David J. Francis, visited Beijing. The frequency of Sierra Leone’s high-level visits clearly demonstrates that China is a priority partner for the country. There are several reasons for this.\nFirst, China is by far Sierra Leone’s biggest export destination. In 2021, Sierra Leone exported $341 million worth of goods to China. Sierra Leone’s second-largest export destination was Belgium, which amounted to less than half the value ($161 million). This makes Sierra Leone one of the few African countries with a trade surplus with China. According to China’s General Administration of Customs (GAC), in 2023 Sierra Leone earned $1.65 in exports for every $1 it imported from China. That said, Sierra Leone exports primarily raw materials to China, such as titanium, iron and aluminum ores, followed by wood and diamonds, which leads to the second reason why China is important for the country.\nChina is also Sierra Leone’s biggest source of foreign direct investment (FDI). For instance, in 2021, China invested $106 million in the country, compared to the United Kingdom’s $66 million and the United States’ $1 million. However, like other investors, to date, Chinese investment in Sierra Leone has focused heavily on the mining of various minerals and iron ore processing.\nThird, China’s lending for infrastructure development as well as aid for other sectors such as livelihoods, healthcare, education, and agriculture has been a key area for collaboration from Sierra Leone’s point of view. For example, the China-Sierra Leone Friendship Highway remains Sierra Leone’s sole modern expressway, playing a pivotal role in connecting the capital city of Freetown with other major urban centers. \nThis third priority, however, has not come without challenges. For instance, in 2018 a new airport project was canceled by the incoming government (still incumbent today), in particular due to concerns raised by the IMF and World Bank about Sierra Leone’s debt sustainability levels. However, new projects utilizing Chinese financing and firms have since been announced, such as a new bridge to the existing airport – the MOU for which was just signed in late 2023 – which is expected to be completed by 2027.\nAnd last but not least, Sierra Leone has been the chair of the African Union’s Committee of Ten (C10) on reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) ever since its creation in 2005. Since China is one of the five permanent members of the UNSC, Sierra Leone is mandated to consult with China regularly on behalf of the African continent to strengthen China’s support for the African Union’s position on reform of the UNSC.\nWhat about China’s interest in Sierra Leone? Just over seven years ago, in December 2016, China and Sierra Leone established a comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership (CSCP). A CSCP is considered the highest level of bilateral relations for China, a position that only 14 African countries hold with China (the others are the Republic of Congo, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guinea, Mozambique, Kenya, Namibia, Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe). There must be something special about Sierra Leone – a country with the population size similar to that of the Chinese city of Chongqing – from China’s point of view as well.\nFirst, Sierra Leone might be a small country but it does have significant mineral resources. China has been making steps to diversify its sources of key mineral and energy imports to enhance resilience and energy security. For example, Sierra Leone made two high-level visits to China in 2019 and 2023. During this period, Beijing was working to reduce reliance on Australia’s iron ore exports, which is Sierra Leone’s key export to China. The 2019 visit resulted in a joint economic and technical cooperation agreement, followed by a noticeable increase in Sierra Leone’s exports to China, from $179 million in 2019 to $762 million in 2022.\nSecond, if influencing China on African positions on global governance is important to Sierra Leone, the interest also runs the other way. Sierra Leone’s leadership within the AU on UNSC reform makes it crucial to engage with to explain Chinese positions and views as well as understand African perspectives.\nThese mutual historic interests aside, the key question remains as to what the future holds for the bilateral relationship, and what this also means for other African countries.\nThe main difference this time was Bio’s heavy focus on diversifying investment.\nThe Bio administration has been working toward positioning Sierra Leone as a key global investment destination, with an emphasis on Sierra Leone’s safety and political stability. Key reforms have been launched to improve Sierra Leone’s business environment, including fast-track procedures for business registration and “one-stop services” for potential investors at the National Investment Board.\nAt part of these efforts, Bio presided over an investment forum during his visit to China, which we attended. Sierra Leonean ministers made detailed presentations on bankable projects to Chinese attendees from diverse sectors including infrastructure, mining, ICT, manufacturing, and education.\nImportantly, the presentations called for not only investments in infrastructure and mining, but also in agriculture and agro-processing of palm oil, rice, sugar, cocoa, oil palm, poultry and seafood, all with a view to providing new jobs in Sierra Leone as well as cutting poverty. Accordingly, the forum also called for investments in education, training, and skill transfers.\nThat said, and as we listened to these presentations, a key gap that stood out was the lack of demand for innovation from the African side. For example, there was no explicit push from Sierra Leone to climb up value chains of its existing exports to China and further develop its manufacturing capacity in those products. And while Sierra Leone has duty-free access to developed markets in North America and Europe as well as China, there was little focus on investment in agro-processing for exports to China – including of products that might require sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) agreements, of which Sierra Leone currently has none with China.\nNevertheless, Bio’s visit suggests that China’s appetite for holistic engagement with Africa – from infrastructure to trade and investment as well as international relations – remains strong, with no significant barrier posed by China’s domestic economic challenges. It also indicates that many African countries, including Sierra Leone, are actively trying to diversify their engagement with China. Will both sides succeed? \nWith the ninth Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) fast approaching in late 2024, and with African countries working hard to recover from COVID-19 and other global shocks, African leaders will need not only to maintain and diversify engagement, but also push Chinese stakeholders to try new approaches.","length":7857,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T00:58:00Z","rating":[8,7,7,6,8,7,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed account of President Bio's visit to China and the implications for China-Sierra Leone relations.

McGoldrick said that, while air drops and naval deliveries help to distribute aid, an increase in reliable ground deliveries is more urgently needed.\nAid groups have accused Israeli forces of restricting ground deliveries, both into and within Gaza. But Israel has denied it is impeding relief efforts.\nIn a post on the social media platform X on Thursday, Sarah Leah Whitson, the executive director of the Washington-based Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), called the latest Biden plan one of many “workarounds to Israel’s deliberate [and] persistent blockade of aid to Gaza”.\nEarlier in the day, Michael Fakhri, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, also warned that Israel’s actions go beyond short-term impediments, representing a broader assault on Gaza’s stability.\n“Israel is not only denying and restricting the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Israel is destroying the food system in Gaza,” he said in a speech to the UN Human Rights Council.\nFor their part, the senior US officials said the new port “will provide the capacity for hundreds of additional truckloads of assistance each day”.\nOne official added that “significant capability will take a number of weeks to plan and execute”. Transporting supplies will also involve establishing a maritime corridor from Cyprus.\nThe officials said Israel had been informed about the plan, and the two countries were working together on security requirements.\nThey added the US was also coordinating with “partners and allies”, including the UN and aid organisations.","length":4095,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T19:13:48Z","rating":[5,6,7,6,6,6,6],"reason":"The article provides factual information regarding President Biden's plan to set up a temporary port in Gaza for humanitarian aid delivery.

The association attributed the sharp decline to lower demand ahead of the Lunar New Year and some consumers bringing forward purchases to the start of the year. Consumers are also holding back after the latest round of price cuts as competition stiffens in China's market, the CPCA said. \n Retail sales of new-energy cars, which include electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, fell 12% to 388,000 units. Tesla delivered 60,365 cars made at its Shanghai plant in February, its lowest monthly figure since late 2022, the data showed. \n Exports of new-energy vehicles edged 0.1% higher to 79,000 units but fell 20% from the previous month.

Official statements and reporting, as well as continuous military strikes, indicate that a new phase of the conflict is unfolding, and it is critical that civilian lives are protected. Even amidst the carnage and extreme polarization, the fundamental principle of humanity must be upheld.\n\"In view of a military operation in densely populated Rafah, we renew our call on the parties to the conflict, and all who have influence on them, to spare and protect civilian lives and infrastructure,\" said Fabrizio Carboni, the ICRC's regional director for the Near and Middle East. \"Under international humanitarian law, parties to the conflict must ensure the basic necessities of life are provided and the necessary safeguards to preserve life are undertaken for the civilian population. It is urgent to do more now. Countless lives are hanging in the balance.\"\nGaza has endured four months of high-intensity conflict. To escape the fighting, many people fled to Gaza's south, where more than 1.5 million people are living on less than 20 percent of Gaza's land (approximately 60 square kilometers). Today, Rafah is so overcrowded that displaced people desperately search for any free space to erect a rudimentary tent.\nMost people did not arrive in Rafah directly, but have been displaced two, three, or four times. There is a lack of food, drinking water, sanitation, health care, and safety. Coupled with constant stress and fear, and taking into account injuries, age, and disabilities, many residents are in a weakened state and at elevated risk of dying from common infections or diseases.\nThis reality needs to be kept in mind as the next steps in the conflict are devised and deployed. International humanitarian law (IHL) prohibits certain actions, amongst them forced displacement, the use of human shields, and attacks that are indiscriminate or cause disproportionate civilian death, injury and destruction.\nIf war plans foresee the evacuation of the population in advance of such hostilities, it is critical that they account for the reality of massive numbers of people moving across bomb-damaged roads, past the rubble of destroyed buildings and through areas contaminated by unexploded weapons. Evacuations have to ensure that civilians arrive safely, and have satisfactory conditions of hygiene, health, safety and nutrition, and that members of the same family are not separated. They must be able to return to their homes as soon as hostilities have stopped. Questions such as how to safely transport the disabled, the elderly, and the sick, and where such a large population can move and reside safely with basic needs met, are critical to answer in advance. Moreover, IHL protects all civilians from the effects of hostilities, including those who may not be able to depart Rafah.\nIsrael, as the occupying power, must ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population are met. In addition, it is necessary -- and only more urgent considering the humanitarian emergency and the escalating hostilities -- that the trickle of aid being let into Gaza becomes a steady, robust stream: food, drinkable water, hygiene items, medicines, and materials to do basic sanitation and allow for adequate shelter. An ICRC medical team has been stationed at the European Gaza Hospital, carrying out more than a dozen urgent surgeries a day, since late October. ICRC teams are responding to humanitarian needs, but we fear that larger-scale operations would continue to be hampered by access and security issues, as well as weapon contamination which endangers civilians and humanitarians alike. Humanitarian organizations need to have minimum guarantees to be able to safely transport the aid and rapidly reach people in need.\nThe International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is a neutral, impartial and independent organization with an exclusively humanitarian mandate that stems from the Geneva Conventions of 1949. It helps people around the world affected by armed conflict and other violence, doing everything it can to protect their lives and dignity and to relieve their suffering, often alongside its Red Cross and Red Crescent partners.\nJessica Moussan, ICRC Dubai, Tel : +971 504 254 091, or jmoussan@icrc.org","length":4771,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[9,7,8,8,9,8,7],"reason":"The article scores high in Accuracy because it provides factual information on the situation in Rafah and the responsibilities under international humanitarian law.

It offers a deep analysis of the challenges faced by the civilian population in Rafah due to the conflict.

Or perhaps you want to just replay a favorite mission or two—you can do that, too! And there’s more to unlock—with Ultimate Levels, Golden Gadget styles, and more!\nSpeaking of styles: we’ve added suit styles for several of Peter’s symbiote story suits in the game, allowing you to further customize your look if you play and unlock them via New Game+ Ultimate Levels. And yes, you’ll be able to set which color your symbiote abilities are as well. But we couldn’t just stop at new styles—we know how much you all love when we add suits with no additional cost to the game. You’re in luck—we’ve brought Marvel’s Hellfire Gala suits to the game for both Peter and Miles. Peter sports the design created by Russell Dauterman, and Miles gets his iconic look from Bernard Chang’s gorgeous Hellfire Gala variant cover for MILES MORALES: SPIDER-MAN (2022) #8. \nAnd you’ll want to show those looks off as much as possible with our updates to Photo Mode—including action figure mode and stickers. You’ll also be able to change the time of day once you complete the story, allowing you to get all those cool Photo Mode shots with just the right lighting. Make sure you share them with us on social by using the #InsomGamesCommunity hashtag!\nThis update also contains some major updates for Accessibility. We’ve added Audio Descriptions** and Screen Reader** to the game. We know that these features were highly anticipated, and we’re thankful to the community for giving us a little extra time to ensure they were polished and ready to be released. We also have additional features like Cinematic Captions and High Contrast Outlines, among several new features added to this update.\nWe’re also excited to announce two new suits for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 that Insomniac Games, Marvel Games, and Gameheads have partnered to create. Early access to the Fly N’ Fresh suits will be available for $4.99. Starting March 7,2024 and continuing through April 5, 2024, PlayStation will donate $4.99 (100% of the purchase price) of each Fly N’ Fresh Suit Pack in the United States to Gameheads, up to $1 million*. We appreciate your help in supporting Gameheads’ mission of empowering low-income youth and youth of color to thrive in the video games industry. Don’t worry, we don’t plan to start charging for suits in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2; the Fly N’ Fresh Suit Pack will be available for at no additional cost to all players at a later date.\n\"Working with Gameheads as part of our efforts to increase representation in the videogame industry is an important cause to us,\" said James Stevenson, Director of Community Management at Insomniac Games. Insomniac Games President Ted Price shares more in this video:\nTo talk more about our collaboration with Gameheads, we sat down with Malia Atta (Insomniac’s Manager of Culture and Belonging), Damon Packwood (Director of Gameheads), and Eric Monacelli (Senior Director, Product and Franchise Development at Marvel Games) for more insight. \nDamon Packwood: “We develop diverse talent and bold new voices in gaming, train students for the tech ecosystem and prepare them for college, career and civic life. We serve low-income students, and underrepresented students (ages 15-25) in 15 different states with expansions to Honolulu and Atlanta.   \nMalia Atta: “Gameheads has been a partner of Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) for many years; however, the partnership with Insomniac Games began when we brought on three apprentices in our Core Technology, People Experience, and Design departments. Each apprentice made meaningful contributions to the game, and we saw an awesome opportunity to support and elevate the Gameheads Mission by asking their artists to design suits for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2.”\nMalia Atta: “The partnership benefits both Insomniac and Gameheads by providing our teams with opportunity to mentor, coach, and develop emerging talent who then infuse fresh ideas and energy into our games and culture. This partnership also makes way for more people from different backgrounds to gain access to the industry.\nFrom a bigger picture, Insomniac Games is focused on creating a supportive, vibrant, and diverse environment that reflects our players and communities. We are currently focused on uplifting and amplifying the voices of our devs and allowing them to bring their unique voices and gifts to how we make games.”\nEric Monacelli: “Our creative collaboration with Insomniac values fostering a world of belonging via our characters in our video games. The Gameheads initiative is a real-world manifestation of this. Marvel has always been about reflecting the world outside one’s window authentically, especially in ways that make creative endeavors and Marvel storytelling more accessible, diverse, and inclusive.”\nWhat was the process like collaborating and iterating on the suit designs?\nDamon Packwood:  “We had a great time working with (Insomniac artists) Bobby Hernandez, Johnson Truong and Davison Carvalho. We had six of our students creating iterations for the suit and stickers over the summer. The process was pretty professional. Our students went through 1-2 week sprints, showcased their artwork to the Insomniac team, got feedback and after a few weeks we settled on a concept. Once the concept was approved, each of the students picked a different aspect of the suit (shoes, texture, mask, web shooters) and we finalized the suit and the stickers in August.”   \nDamon Packwood: “The inspiration for Miles Morales' Fresh Suit design was a 90’s b-boy. Peter Parker’s Fly Suit design was inspired by 90s television’. Marisa Diaz, who designed the suits, was just having fun. We never expected Insomniac to like it but it was definitely fun to design. Our designers had fun being silly and the older folks, me and the Insomniac crew, had fun reminiscing on our 90's fashion choices.”  \nThat’s all for now!

Lealos, James Hunt","excerpt":"Michael Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has an ending that's both ambiguous and satisfying. Here's what happens and what it means.","textContent":"Michael Gondry's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has an ending that's both ambiguous and satisfying. Here's what happens and what it means.\n is a beautiful yet complex journey of love, memory, and acceptance. \n The film's ambiguous and satisfying ending explores the cyclical nature of love and the importance of memories in shaping our lives. \n Despite the risks and potential pitfalls, Joel and Clementine choose to take a leap of faith and explore their feelings, embracing the unpredictable nature of love. \nThe ending of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind explained the story of Joel & Clementine and the full impact of their deliberate memory-wiping. Directed by Michael Gondry from a script by Charlie Kauffman, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind follows Joel Barish (Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet), two strangers who meet on a train and then fall in and out of love. The pair both undergo treatment to have their memories of the other removed, although not before recording tapes to remind them of every little thing they hated about the other.\nDespite trying to forget one-another, Joel and Clementine find their way back to each other, although it's not an easy path, nor a linear one. Large portions of the movie take place in Joel's mind. As the story pushes forward, events replay with blanks being filled in, and their relationship starts to blossom — again to the audience, but for the first time for them. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has been celebrated as a modern masterpiece since its release, and a large part of that is down to its ambiguous and satisfying ending.\n Related Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind: Facts You Didn't Know About The Movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind quickly became a cult hit. Fans might not know all the details that went into making the Michel Gondry movie. \nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind has Joel and Clementine learning the truth about what happened to them, and what they thought about each other before undergoing the procedure. Having both made their way to Montauk, which itself stemmed from a memory Joel had during his treatment, they receive the tapes thanks to Mary, a technician at Lacuna, discovering that she underwent the memory erasure procedure to forget about her affair with the head of the company, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.\nMary mails out all the tapes, and eventually both Joel and Clementine come to listen. They're horrified at the things they said — and felt — about one another, especially because to them the relationship is so new and exciting. However, they decide to give things another go. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind ends with Joel and Clementine agreeing to start again/for the first time, before closing out with a loop of the pair in the snow.\n Related Jim Carrey's 10 Best Movies, Ranked Jim Carrey has starred in a number of outstanding films over the course of his distinguished career, making it worthwhile to rank his 10 best films. \n Why Joel & Clementine Get Back Together In Eternal Sunshine's Ending \nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's ending not only sees Clementine almost walk out of Joel's life, but it acknowledges the pair getting back together is a potential mistake. While Joel insists he \"can't think of anything\" he doesn't like about her, Clementine responds that he will and that she'll \"get bored...and feel trapped.\" Despite that, the closing moments of the film ostensibly see them getting back together despite those risks; both are accepting of it, as evidenced by Eternal Sunshine's repetition of \"okay.\"\nAlthough the film isn't explicit, which is by its design, and that \"okay\" could mean \"okay, let's not try again,\" the implication is they are back together at this point. But knowing what they do now, it begs a fair question of why they're going to go through with it, despite having heard where it'll lead. Joel and Clementine make the romantic choice at the end of Eternal Sunshine: that it's better to love, lose, love, and potentially lose again than it is to not have those real memories.\nIn the end, they choose to take a leap of faith with one another and decide to explore their feelings and see where they lead, rather than shutting them off completely and being miserable again.\nIt might not work out, but right now, that's all part of the adventure they can go on together, as they re-discover who the other person is, and also find a big part of themselves that's been missing too. Even if they do break up again, they cannot be complete without knowing what it's like to be with each other, because it's a very literal missing piece of their respective puzzles. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is about memory — and so too is life, but that goes for both good and bad.\nIt's all those memories that make up a person's life, and Joel and Clementine need that if they're to go on. Things could end up different this time, especially with prior knowledge of these things. In the end, they choose to take a leap of faith with one another and decide to explore their feelings and see where they lead, rather than shutting them off completely and being miserable again. It may end in heartache, but they also know it'll bring happiness, laughter, and love into their lives, so it is worth a shot.\n Related Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind & 9 Other Essential Breakup Movies Everyone knows breakups are the worst. Excellent films like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind perfectly and profoundly capture the heartbreak. \nWith Joel and Clementine entering into this new relationship, the audience is aware of the potential dangers. While the choice they make is the right, albeit more difficult, one, it doesn't guarantee a happy ending. There are no hints in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's ending that this is a couple built to last, or that things will end differently. If getting back together is to highlight the oft-cyclical nature of life and the way people can repeat mistakes, then it would be easy to argue they will break up once more.\nJoel and Clementine have a rare second chance to start anew together.\nHaving witnessed Joel and Clementine's relationship, it is clear there are many ways in which they're not compatible, with almost countless things about them that will irritate and wear down the other. And since it didn't work before, it could mean it won't work again. But at the same time, part of making mistakes is to take the opportunity to grow and learn from them; to do things differently. It may be that way with other people, but Joel and Clementine have a rare second chance to start anew together.\nPart of the beauty of the ending is that ambiguous, bittersweet nature to it, where a person's interpretation can come down less to what the film presents, which could go either way, and more to the kind of person they are, allowing the viewer to take what they want from it without trading on delivering on the film's overall themes and messages, and still giving a satisfying sense of closure.\n Related 15 Movies To Watch If You Loved Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind Make sure you check out these other strange and compelling movies if you loved Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. \nOne of the most decisive moments in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind comes not from Joel or Clementine, but from Mary (Kirsten Dunst), the Lacuna employee who sends out the tapes. While this serves a crucial narrative function — to effectively give Joel and Clementine their memories of one another back — it also has a greater thematic purpose as well. Mary's choice isn't just her lashing out in anger at Dr. Mierzwiak and an attempt at revenge, though it is both of those things.\nThis is not least because of the damage it will do to the company — but also because of how she gives Joel, Clementine, and all the other Lacuna patients the choice that she never had. Mary had to discover the hard way of the memory erasure procedure she went through, of the affair with Dr. Mierzwiak, and the fact it is happening all over again.\nThis regret at experiencing the same pain twice (and quite specifically, the pain of heartbreak), without first being allowed to learn and grow from it, is a key part of the human experience that she was robbed of. That's not something Mary can rectify with herself, because she went through the treatment alone and because of who she tried to forget, but it's something other people — especially Joel and Clementine — can learn from.\n Related 10 Romance Movies That Feature The \"Right Person, Wrong Time\" Trope From Cha Cha Smooth to Before Sunrise, romance fans might enjoy these movies that follow the \"right person, wrong time\" trope. \nThe Movie Hints That The Couple Are Stuck In A Loop\nOne of the major questions left behind by Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's ending is whether what we're seeing play out is the first and/or only time Joel and Clementine have had their memories wiped. The cyclical, non-linear structure of the film's narrative itself suggests that this is a real possibility and that Joel and Clementine have walked down this path many times before. The key signifier of this comes in the movie's closing sequence, which sees Joel and Clementine in the snow in Montauk.\nThe scene briefly plays, and then jarringly cuts back to the beginning, happening several times over on a loop. This suggests that Joel and Clementine themselves are trapped in this very loop, of finding one another, falling in love, starting to resent each other, breaking up and having their memories wiped, and then finding their way back to each other again, the process beginning anew each time.\nEven the weather fits this: snow itself can represent a fresh start, a blanket covering what went before, that then melts away. If this is the case, then Joel and Clementine could have been through this an untold number of times. The notion is also supported by Kauffman's original script for the film (via Screenplays For You) which, among its differences, ends with a much older version of Clementine, whose file has \"a list of fifteen dates of previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them involving Joel Barish.\"\nAlthough Kauffman shifted away from this, and into something that is at once perhaps more ambiguous and more hopeful (and works better, in truth), it supports the notions the film itself does have in that Joel and Clem have been through this before. That itself, however, does nothing to undercut their journey, but instead shows the powerful connection they share, and how they will keep finding their way back to one another.\n Related Kate Winslet's 10 Best Movies, Ranked With roles in comedies, challenging dramas, and romantic period pieces, Kate Winslet stands as one of the best actors of her generation. \nThe Movie Is About Love Being Worth It Despite The Pain\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind's ending doesn't just bring together its various narrative beats and provide a resolution (of sorts) for Joel and Clementine, but it also ties together the themes and deeper meanings of the movie as a whole. That Joel and Clementine seemingly choose to try again (and perhaps do so many times) helps speak to the nature and importance of memories as a tool for life lessons; that they're something to be cherished, not erased.\nThat itself is ultimately a choice in favor of love, and a victory for it too. Despite the pain love can cause, it's ultimately going to be worth it for the joy and, of course, the memories it will bring and leave viewers with. It's an experience that is better to have than not have, which is something Joel and Clementine accept in the end. The ending of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind explained grander themes still of love, and more specifically who they love, and the choices around that.\nJoel and Clementine are very different people, and they bring out both the best and the worst in each other. That they are so drawn together shows that love is boundless and a person cannot choose who they love; it can be unpredictable and senseless, but that's the way it works. What a person can choose is whether they accept that love or not, the risks that come with it, and if they're going to be worth it, which is what Joel and Clementine do at the end of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.\n Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet star in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind as Joel Barish and Clementine Kruczynski, a couple who rediscover their love after erasing each other from their memories.

Researchers say the milk in many ways resembles that produced by mammals.","textContent":"Caecilians are amphibians that look superficially like very large earthworms. New research suggests that at least one species of caecilian also produces \"milk\" for its hatchlings.\n Caecilians are amphibians that look superficially like very large earthworms. New research suggests that at least one species of caecilian also produces \"milk\" for its hatchlings.\n A species of worm-like amphibian has been caught on camera feeding milk to its young. The creature, known as a caecilian, lives underground. Researchers believe that the animal developed the ability to produce a milk-like substance independently of mammals, who are universally known for feeding milk to their young. Caecilians are descended from the same lineage as frogs and salamanders. Hundreds of millions of years ago, their ancestors burrowed deep into the ground. They lost their legs, their eyes mostly stopped working, and their bodies became long and segmented. A modern caecilian looks a little like a long shimmering earthworm with a head, which has led some to call them icky. \n That's a characterization Marta Antoniazzi totally rejects. \"I really don't agree that they are disgusting,\" says Marta Antoniazzi, a biologist at the Instituto Butantan, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Brazil is home to lots of caecilians and Antoniazzi is a fan. \n \"They are kind of elegant, and they have a shiny body and a very nice face,\" she says. But wait, there's more. The particular caecilian species that Antoniazzi and her colleagues study is called Siphonops annulatus. Mothers of this species give birth to broods of wriggly babies who then proceed to eat their own mother's skin off. \"Once a week, they can eat her skin,\" says Pedro Luiz Mailho-Fontana, a researcher at the Insituto Butantan who was involved in the study. This doesn't seem to bother mama, and the babies get lots of nutrition from the skin. Carlos Jared directs the institute's department of structural biology and leads the team that was studying the caecilians. As he was watching this fascinating process, he couldn't help but notice the wriggly little babies had a ton of energy. \"They are so, so active, it's impossible to eat only once or twice per week,\" he says. So the team stuck a camera in the nest and started watching. And pretty soon, they noticed the babies were gathering around one particular spot. \n \"The babies prefer to go to the tail of the mother,\" he says. And that's when they saw it. A secretion coming from the tail: \"A kind of substance, like milk.\" Upon further study, the team found that the milk contained lipids and sugars similar to mammalian milk. It was essentially providing the same function. \"It's a very unusual form of nutrition\" for an egg-laying animal, says Mailho-Fontana. The team published their results in this week's issue of the Journal Science. \n Marvalee Wake, a professor of integrative biology at the University of California at Berkeley, who was not involved with the study, says that this species of caecilian has evolved to deal with a similar problem faced by human babies. Just like humans, the little ones are born long before they can fend for themselves. They're vulnerable. And in order to help them grow, while keeping them close, their mother has developed a milk-ish fluid. \"This is convergent evolution,\" she says. Convergent evolution is the process by which very different species can evolve similar traits. But is it really milk? The Brazilian team doesn't say whether the milk meets FDA standards, but it does contain lipids and sugars. Wake says she thinks it counts. \"If it has all these basic subunits, it's convergent evolution on a nutritive material, and that's what it's all about,\" she says. For Antoniazzi, caecilians are a wonderful reminder that very different animals, like puppies and underground worm-amphibians, can share a lot in common. \"Nature is very creative,\" she says. \"Sometimes it gives the same solution to different groups of animals.\"","length":4567,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T14:01:11-05:00","rating":[8,7,9,8,8,9,7],"reason":"The article is highly accurate, presenting scientific findings about a caecilian species producing milk for its young, supported by research published in a reputable journal.

The photos, which have not been linked to the Trump campaign, emerged as Trump seeks to win over Black voters who polls show remain loyal to President Joe Biden. The fabricated images, highlighted in a recent BBC investigation, provide further evidence to support warnings that the use of AI-generated imagery will only increase as the November general election approaches. Experts said they highlight the danger that any group — Latinos, women, older male voters — could be targeted with lifelike images meant to mislead and confuse as well as demonstrate the need for regulation around the technology.\nIn a report published this week, researchers at the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate used several popular AI programs to show how easy it is to create realistic deepfakes that can fool voters. The researchers were able to generate images of Trump meeting with Russian operatives, Biden stuffing a ballot box and armed militia members at polling places, even though many of these AI programs say they have rules to prohibit this kind of content.\nThe center analyzed some of the recent deepfakes of Trump and Black voters and determined that at least one was originally created as satire but was now being shared by Trump supporters as evidence of his support among Blacks.\nSocial media platforms and AI companies must do more to protect users from AI’s harmful effects, said Imran Ahmed, the center’s CEO and founder.“If a picture is worth a thousand words, then these dangerously susceptible image generators, coupled with the dismal content moderation efforts of mainstream social media, represent as powerful a tool for bad actors to mislead voters as we’ve ever seen,” Ahmed said. “This is a wake-up call for AI companies, social media platforms and lawmakers – act now or put American democracy at risk.”\nThe images prompted alarm on both the right and left that they could mislead people about the former president’s support among African Americans. Some in Trump’s orbit have expressed frustration at the circulation of the fake images, believing that the manufactured scenes undermine Republican outreach to Black voters.“If you see a photo of Trump with Black folks and you don’t see it posted on an official campaign or surrogate page, it didn’t happen,” said Diante Johnson, president of the Black Conservative Federation. “It’s nonsensical to think that the Trump campaign would have to use AI to show his Black support.”Experts expect additional efforts to use AI-generated deepfakes to target specific voter blocs in key swing states, such as Latinos, women, Asian Americans and older conservatives, or any other demographic that a campaign hopes to attract, mislead or frighten. With dozens of countries holding elections this year, the challenges posed by deepfakes are a global issue.\nIn January, voters in New Hampshire received a robocall that mimicked Biden’s voice telling them, falsely, that if they cast a ballot in that state’s primary they would be ineligible to vote in the general election. A political consultant later acknowledged creating the robocall, which may be the first known attempt to use AI to interfere with a U.S. election.Such content can have a corrosive effect even when it’s not believed, according to a February study by researchers at Stanford University examining the potential impacts of AI on Black communities. When people realize they can’t trust images they see online, they may start to discount legitimate sources of information. “As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent and difficult to distinguish from human-generated content, individuals may become more skeptical and distrustful of the information they receive,” the researchers wrote. \nEven if it doesn’t succeed in fooling a large number of voters, AI-generated content about voting, candidates and elections can make it harder for anyone to distinguish fact from fiction, causing them to discount legitimate sources of information and fueling a loss of trust that’s undermining faith in democracy while widening political polarization.While false claims about candidates and elections are nothing new, AI makes it faster, cheaper and easier than ever to craft lifelike images, video and audio. When released onto social media platforms like TikTok, Facebook or X, AI deepfakes can reach millions before tech companies, government officials or legitimate news outlets are even aware of their existence. “AI simply accelerated and pressed fast forward on misinformation,” said Joe Paul, a business executive and advocate who has worked to increase digital access among communities of color. Paul noted that Black communities often have “this history of mistrust” with major institutions, including in politics and media, that both make Black communities more skeptical of public narratives about them as well as fact-checking meant to inform the community.\nDigital literacy and critical thinking skills are one defense against AI-generated misinformation, Paul said. “The goal is to empower folks to critically evaluate the information that they encounter online. The ability to think critically is a lost art among all communities, not just Black communities.”","length":5649,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T05:09:35","rating":[7,7,8,6,8,7,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the use of artificial intelligence in generating fake images related to Trump and Black supporters.

By demolishing the neighbors' houses for loot, obviously.Defeating new enemy types in Pull Stay gives you their moves, which lets you ever-more-successfuly put the hurt on bad guys.

The five-block unit not only represents the process of turning over stone to explore archaeological excavation but also shows the ancient relationship between the surrounding trench settlements. The arc shape of jade connects the five-block unit as an open lounge area, symbolizing the ancient rice fields connecting the trenches.The Sacred Grove Burning Man TempleDIALOGCompetition for the 2024 Burning Man TempleThe Sacred Grove Burning Man Temple / DIALOG.

The inspiration behind DIALOG’s design was to rethink traditional religious structures by incorporating elements that recalled back to a simpler time when forests were considered the original houses of worship across global cultures. The perforated wood ceiling is set to mimic the forest floor and alludes to nature’s rebirth throughout the four seasons. Additionally, working off of Burning Man’s universal theme around grief, closure and catharsis, DIALOG planned to utilize donated recycled waste, solar generators, and a comprehensive “leave no trace plan” to return the area back to its original form, once burned.Urban Regeneration of the Cibin Market AreaSfera ArhitecturaUrban Regeneration of the Cibin Market Area Competition – 3rd PlaceUrban Regeneration of the Cibin Market Area / Sfera Arhitectura.

Trump’s visits to court, and his behavior there, have created security concerns.Credit...Shannon Stapleton/ReutersA New York judge on Thursday effectively barred former President Donald J. Trump from exposing the identities of potential jurors at his first criminal trial later this month, emphasizing a need to protect those who might decide the highly sensitive case.The judge presiding over the trial, Juan M. Merchan, granted a request from the Manhattan district attorney’s office to withhold the names of jurors from the public. The judge also ordered that their addresses be kept from everyone except the lawyers in the case.Mr. Trump’s legal team, which is defending the former president from accusations of covering up a potential sex scandal during the 2016 election, agreed that it was appropriate to keep the jury’s information private.A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Todd Blanche, declined to comment Thursday.New York State does not allow juries to operate in full anonymity, meaning that defendants are allowed to know jurors’ names. Justice Merchan, however, moved to shield the names of the jurors in Mr. Trump’s trial from the broader public, underscoring the potential harm in a case involving a polarizing figure like the former president who can whip his supporters into a frenzy.The restrictions and concerns about juror safety reflect the volatile environment swirling around Mr. Trump’s legal entanglements, including four criminal cases and several civil trials. After Mr. Trump recently lost a civil fraud case in New York, which was brought by the state’s attorney general, envelopes of white powder were sent to both the attorney general’s office and the judge who had overseen the case. The judge was also the victim of a hoax bomb threat on the day of closing arguments.Jury selection in Mr. Trump’s criminal trial is set for March 25, making it the first prosecution of a former American president. He is charged with a raft of felonies stemming from a hush-money payment to a porn star during the 2016 presidential campaign — a payoff that Mr. Trump is accused of hiding from voters.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

But the brand’s “handcrafted in France” reputation only bolsters the popularity of its products. Oftentimes, heritage brands carry timeless pieces in terms of function and design. Although that’s certainly true of Le Creuset, they still consistently surprise us with bold hues, fun shapes, and somewhat lesser known kitchen accessories that deserve icon status every bit as much as their cult-favorite Dutch oven. If you’re a fan of cookware that’s whimsical enough to double as decor, you’ll love the most recent Le Creuset find we stumbled across. The flower cocotte carries out the same functions as the traditional Dutch oven, but it takes up way less space and makes a major statement on your stove. Plus, it’s currently on sale for under $200, meaning you can snag your next mealtime must-have for just over $60 off its original price.Flower CocotteFlower Cocotte$183.75 (was $245) at Le CreusetWhat is the Le Creuset Flower Cocotte?Much like Le Creuset’s other Dutch ovens, the 2.25-quart flower cocotte can be used to cook a variety of things. It’s made of the brand’s signature enameled cast iron, so it’s oven-safe up to 500°F. As a result, you can make roasts, bread, and cute flower-shaped cakes in the oven. On the stove, cook anything from stews to soups to one-pot pasta meals — the options are endless. And cleanup is a breeze, too, thanks to the cocotte’s scratch-resistant and dishwasher-safe material. You’ll also love its generous side handles, which allow for easy transportation from oven to stove to table, as well as the ergonomic lid knob.

The Lidl-Trek rider hasn’t raced in 18 months, having taken time away from the sport to give birth to her first child, and said that while much as changed in her life outside of cycling, she is excited to return to the peloton.\"I am very excited to finally rejoin the team and be back racing after around 18 months without it. I have been training for most of that time but a lot has happened in between and so much has also changed in my life outside cycling. While I am really happy to finally go back to racing, I am also, of course, curious as to where I stand at the moment,\" Van Dijk said.\"Even though training has gone well and everything is going according to plan, returning to racing after any amount of time off is always a bit of an unknown and I will always be a little nervous to go back into the peloton and have this feeling again.”Vuelta Extremadura Féminas is a three-day race that offers a 17.2km time trial on the final day in Zafra. Van Dijk, a former three-time world champion in the discipline, has already stated her goals for the time trial event at the Paris Olympics and hasn't ruled out attempting another Hour Record.“We picked this race as my first race back because it has a nice time trial in it, so that’s my main goal of these three days. I really want to get back into TT mode and see where my level is at this moment,\" Van Dijk said in a team press release.\"We have trained a lot for it already and I am excited to ride a time trial again, especially in my first race back. It’s the discipline I love the most, so I am really happy that I can get back to it straight away.\"After that, it’s all about easing into it again, getting back into the peloton, getting that race feeling back and being a part of the team. This is a smaller race than the Spring Classics, so I am really happy that I can start here and build towards the bigger races.\"However, at the same time, it also comes with a bit of a heavy heart because I will be leaving home again. I have been together with my partner Benjamin, and Faas, who was born five months ago. This will be the first time I really have to leave them alone and being apart will mentally be a challenge.\"After competing at the Vuelta Extremadura Féminas, Van Dijk will turn her attention to the Spring Classics.Van Dijk hasn’t raced since the Chrono des Nations in October 2022 but said she has spent time training during her time away from racing. She has also completed tests while training on the track and has previewed the road race and time trial courses for the Paris Olympics.Asked by her Lidl-Trek team to reflect on what she has taken away from her experience of becoming a mother, Van Dijk said, \"For sure, the pain which I experienced when I was giving birth was something that I have never ever felt before or could have ever described beforehand. So, when I am suffering on the bike I can always think back to that and remember that it could be 10 times, or more, worse. That’s, for sure, something I will take with me. I think I have also learned that you can function with a lot less sleep than I could have imagined before so, if I ever have bad night’s sleep, I won’t worry again.\"When I was pregnant, we made an ideal plan, which, in fact, was to come back for this race. We thought this was the earliest I could come back to racing and that was also factoring in that I wanted to breastfeed. We knew that there could be setbacks and anything could happen, but so far, very fortunately, everything has gone according to plan so, it’s now time to go back to racing.\"\nVan Dijk also said she feels prepared to begin racing again and looks forward to pinning a bib number on and joining her Lidl-Trek teammates on the start line.\"I do feel really ready. I have trained a lot and once you start to get sick of training, you know it’s time to start racing again, so bring it on.”\nThank you for reading 5 articles in the past 30 days*Join now for unlimited accessEnjoy your first month for just £1 / $1 / €1\n*Read any 5 articles for free in each 30-day period, this automatically resetsAfter your trial you will be billed £4.99 $7.99 €5.99 per month, cancel anytime.

During their chat, Villeneuve explained why he found Chalamet to be “jaded” on the set of the blockbuster sequel.Dune: Part One was Chalamet’s first foray into leading a Hollywood blockbuster after several years of acclaimed work in smaller movies. Because of this, and because Chalamet is close in age to his own children, Villeneuve admitted to being “paternalistic” towards the young star.“At the beginning, I had a lot of empathy for Timothée that he was stepping forward in a production of that scale,” Villeneuve explained. “When he walked into the set of Part Two, it was totally different. Much more confident. Much more solid. He was not impressed by the size of things anymore,” the director told Chalamet.“You were jaded!” Villeneuve said, half-seriously, to which Chalamet protested, “No!”“I was grateful,” Chalamet said of Villeneuve’s attention on the first film. “The scale was so large, the actors were such titans. I felt a protected aura.”Chalamet perhaps has some reason to be “jaded” at this point in his career, even if Villeneuve wasn’t entirely serious. Many critics and industry insiders were uncertain, prior to Part One, if Chalamet could carry a blockbuster.Even after he proved he could with the film’s critical and commercial success, it remained unclear if Chalamet’s name alone could guarantee an audience. That changed last December with Wonka, a musical retooling of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which has been a surprise hit. The film, which stars Chalamet alongside lesser-known British actors, has grossed over $600M worldwide to date.Villeneuve feels honored to be able to see Chalamet progress so far in his career in such a short amount of time. “It’s the first time that I had the chance to see an artist growing up in front of the camera,” the filmmaker told NYT. “That’s very moving.”Dune: Part Two arrives in cinemas on March 1.","length":2124,"publishedTime":"2024-02-22T21:41:02Z","rating":[5,8,7,6,7,6,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the interaction between director Denis Villeneuve and actor Timothée Chalamet on the set of \"Dune: Part Two.\" It maintains objectivity by presenting quotes from both individuals without introducing personal bias.

My patients have asked; friends and family members have asked. We point to the national vaccine recommendations, although increasingly this question has become challenging to answer. I didn't quite have the estimates on hand that I might hope to share with patients.\"\nTo build that evidence, Lo and his team at Stanford Medicine turned to their area of expertise, computational modeling. The researchers developed a simulation model using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 surveillance data and vaccine effectiveness estimates to predict the frequency of COVID-19 vaccination that best prevents severe disease in different U.S. populations. They published a study describing that model and its results in the journal Nature Communications, led by Lo, who is the senior author of the study and an assistant professor of medicine.\nThe model's results largely square with data on who is most at risk of bad outcomes from COVID-19: For those older than 65 or who are immunocompromised, more frequent boosters -; at least annually -; go further to protect against hospitalization or death. For younger populations, the benefit of frequent boosting against severe disease is more modest.\nThe researchers hope this model can help inform both individuals making decisions about when to get boosters as well as public health policy makers.\n\"We're in the fourth year of the pandemic now, and we're shifting toward more long-term mitigation strategies,\" said Stanford Medicine research data scientist Hailey Park, who is the lead author on the study. \"We know that protection from vaccination wanes, and we know that disease risk is very heterogeneous in the population. So how do we come up with a more optimal timing for boosters?\"\nThe model is what's known as a microsimulation, meaning it simulates a large population with results at the individual level, Park said. She and her colleagues built a simulation of millions of individuals with their unique traits, aiming to mimic the overall U.S. adult population -; except these simulated people had received their initial COVID-19 vaccinations. Using the CDC's weekly COVID-19 surveillance data starting in September 2022, when the bivalent booster was first available, the model predicted how many severe infections leading to hospitalization or death would result in different age or health status groups over the course of two years. The team estimated outcomes if those individuals received just one COVID booster, a booster every year or a shot every six months.\nFor those over 75 years, receiving a yearly booster reduced annual severe infections from around 1,400 cases per 100,000 people to about 1,200 cases. Bumping the booster up to twice a year dropped severe infections to just over 1,000 per 100,000. The numbers are similar for those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, and about half that reduction for those aged 65 to 74. For younger, healthy people, the drop is much smaller: Annual or twice-yearly boosters reduced severe infections in people aged 18 to 49 by only 14 to 26 cases per 100,000 people.\nRelated StoriesAssociation of estrogen-containing menopause hormonal therapy with COVID-19 mortalityCOVID-19 exposes deep-rooted structural inequities affecting vaccine uptake among ACB groupsNew study shows XBB.1.5 COVID-19 vaccine significantly reduces hospitalizations and ICU admissions in older adults\"These high-risk populations benefit from more frequent boosters relative to younger and healthier individuals, and I think that's intuitive,\" Lo said. \"But it's helpful to see the numbers; what is the difference in magnitude of risk?\"\nThese findings support current CDC recommendations and the benefit of at least annual boosters to people 65 and older and immunocompromised populations, and suggest that public health strategies to increase booster uptake could get the most bang for their buck by focusing on the high-risk populations.\n\"In this study we focused on a goal of reducing severe COVID-19 leading to hospitalization, but there are numerous other considerations that influence vaccine decisions,\" Lo said.\nThe team considered how novel variants and overall transmission play into decisions on how frequently to receive booster vaccines. They looked at the effect of new viral variants with regard to evasion of the immune system and found that the benefit of more frequent boosters for all groups was larger if new vaccine formulations were better matched to the latest variants.\nIn addition, the team looked at the impact of transmission: Compared with more restricted booster programs targeting only higher risk populations, more inclusive frequent booster programs (for all age and risk groups) led to lower transmission, with additional benefit for the highest risk groups.\nThe researchers note that frequent vaccination also helped reduce non-severe cases in all risk groups. \"There are a multitude of considerations here, and the optimal vaccine recommendations will depend on what is factored into the decision,\" Lo said.\nThe scientists also included prior COVID-19 infection in their model, finding less benefit from frequent vaccination to prevent severe disease for those who had previously had a case of COVID-19 compared with those who hadn't. Prior infection gives a short window of protection against infection, so the booster's protection on top of that is smaller.\nDue to a lack of data and to simplify the model, some variables weren't accounted for in the study: The likelihood of infection for each group was assumed to be the same over time, even though infection risk differs in real life. The model was also based on data from earlier circulating variants and vaccine formulations. Immunocompromised people were clustered into two groups in the model, although these populations are actually much more variable, and the model did not address vaccine hesitancy or the risks of long COVID.\nLo and his colleagues plan to share their findings with policy makers and will update the model with new data as it becomes available, hoping to shed even more light on the tricky question of vaccine frequency.\n\"In science, there are some questions that get easier over time and some that get more challenging over time,\" Lo said. \"This is one of the latter.\"\nResearchers from the Yale School of Public Health; the University of California, San Francisco; and the California Department of Public Health also contributed to the study.\nThe study was funded by the National Institutes of Health (grant DP2 AI170485) and the California Department of Public Health.\nSource:Journal reference:Park, H.

They say if anything, there’s a need for stronger safety standards.\nThe state Senate will soon take up House Bill 2089, which cleared the House on Tuesday. The measure would extend the deadline for the State Building Code Council to update and adopt building and residential codes every six years instead of every three years. \nDevelopers and the construction industry support the slowing of the building code adoption cycle, though some are concerned it will compromise residents’ safety. (Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2015)\nGabe Maser of the International Code Council says the proposed delay of the renewal cycle for codes puts Hawaii in “unprecedented territory” and represented a “deeply abnormal response to a disaster.”\n“No other state or territory has ever responded to a tragedy by weakening standards uniformly,” he said.\nMembers of the construction industry support the change because they say the overly burdensome code adoption process slows building and increases costs, feeding Hawaii’s housing supply issues. \nHawaii is trying to resolve a housing shortage so dire that Gov. Josh Green declared the housing situation an emergency in July. Last renewed on Feb. 23, his proclamation stalls any updates to the state building codes “to allow for consistency and stability in the construction of housing.”\nHawaii uses the International Code Council’s codes — which are updated every three years — as its blueprint for building, residential and energy codes. The state’s code, created by the State Building Code Council, is the foundation for the county codes, which are then updated within two years after the state codes are put in place.\nThe counties have long said they are unable to keep up with a process they say is too fast and onerous, delaying the permitting process. \nModern building codes is one reason that architects argue some of Lahaina’s building survived the Aug. 8 fires. (Kevin Fujii/Civil Beat/2023)\nLawmakers have considered bills intended to relax the code adoption process for at least the past five years but none have passed. Some have even proposed dissolving the State Building Code Council altogether.\nPeople are “starting to see through the idea that a non-government organization should dictate the pace of change to our building code cycle,” Greg Thielen of the Building Industry Association of Hawaii said.\nNot all states follow the same cycle as Hawaii, and some leave the building codes to counties to decide their own processes. \nThe constant change in codes in Hawaii is creating “a perverse incentive to keep old housing stock,” Thielen said. \nHawaii’s chapter of the American Institute of Architects does not support the legislation despite being frustrated by the current situation. AIA President Reid Mizue says codes are issues for the counties to address rather than the state. \nIt is fundamentally a safety issue, Mizue said, which as architects is “one of the main reasons we are licensed in the first place.” \nRep. Luke Evslin of Kauai introduced a long list of bills aiming to address Hawaii’s housing woes. (David Croxford/Civil Beat/2023)\nAllowing the state to update its building codes according to every other ICC code update, along with another two years for the counties to update their own, means homes built in 2030 could be built to ICC’s 2021 code. \nGiving counties more time to catch up will provide the developers and construction outfits greater stability, Thielen said. \n“I would rather see 15,000 new houses a year built on the 2006 code than 2,000 new houses a year built on the 2021,” Thielen said. “And I would make the argument that it’s much safer for the built environment of Oahu and Hawaii as a whole if you do things that way.”\nThe ICC, along with 24 other signatories, sent a letter to House and Senate leadership on Tuesday saying that changing the code would mean Hawaii’s residents would be “forced to pay new home prices for homes constructed to decade-old standards.”\nRep. Luke Evslin, chair of the Housing Committee, introduced HB 2089. He says, “it was never intended to be a permanent solution” but rather a stopgap. \nThe bill initially attracted climate groups’ ire for also proposing an extension of updates to the energy code, which representatives removed over concerns it may compromise the state’s progress towards its climate goals. \nAcross the country builders’ associations are fighting against energy codes. In North Carolina, a bill partly drafted by the state builders’ association delayed any update to the state’s code until 2031, according to The Washington Post.\nEnvironmental groups were somewhat appeased by the removal of the energy code, but members of the construction industry and developers want the code to be reinserted into the bill. \nBut Thielen said the BIA would support the bill with or without the inclusion of the energy code.\nHB 2089 was transmitted to the Senate during Tuesday’s House floor session with four votes against it.\nIt’s unclear what the Senate intends to do. It will likely be referred to committee for senators to consider.\nSen. Stanley Chang, Housing Committee chair, said good points had been made for and against the bill.\nCivil Beat’s coverage of Maui County is supported in part by a grant from the Nuestro Futuro Foundation. \n Sign up for our FREE morning newsletter and face each day more informed.","length":6464,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T10:01:00Z","rating":[7,5,6,4,7,6,5],"reason":"While the article provides a detailed view of the debate surrounding the proposed changes to building codes in Hawaii, it lacks depth in analysis as it mainly presents contrasting viewpoints without delving into the potential consequences or implications of the proposed legislation.

The Shepard-Byrd Act, which was passed in 2009, allows federal criminal prosecution of hate crimes motivated by the victim’s actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity.\nRitter faces life in prison for the crime, with a sentencing hearing set to be scheduled for a later date. \nIn a statement released following the conviction, assistant attorney general Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said: “A unanimous jury has found the defendant guilty for the heinous and tragic murder of Dime Doe, a Black transgender woman. \n“The jury’s verdict sends a clear message: Black trans lives matter, bias-motivated violence will not be tolerated, and perpetrators of hate crimes will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. \n“This case is historic; this defendant is the first to be found guilty by trial verdict for a hate crime motivated by gender identity under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.” \nClarke added: “We want the Black trans community to know that you are seen and heard, that we stand with the LGBTQI+ community, and that we will use every tool available to seek justice for victims and their families.”\nEvidence presented at trial revealed Ritter and Doe were engaged in a sexual relationship – which he wanted to keep secret – and he was unhappy that rumours of a relationship between them were circulating in the community. \nOn 4 August, 2019, he lured Doe to a remote road in Allendale in South Carolina and proceeded to shoot her in the head three times, killing her. Her body was discovered slumped over the steering wheel of her car. \nFollowing Doe’s murder, Ritter burned the clothes he had been wearing, disposed of the murder weapon and proceeded to lie to law enforcement about the incident. \nAt trial, the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Ritter murdered Doe because of her gender identity as a trans woman. \n“Years of collaborative work were validated by a jury’s unanimous verdict: guilty. This sends a message of hope to our community that we will fight for the rights of those targeted for their gender identity or sexual orientation,” said US attorney Adair F. Boroughs for the District of South Carolina. \n“As Dime Doe’s loved ones remember her, we hope this verdict provides them some comfort.\n“Our office will continue to work with the FBI to increase education on federal hate crime statues and how we can, and will, prosecute crimes motivated by bias in South Carolina.”\nThanks for registering!

Will Satoshi Nakamoto?","textContent":"Bitcoin is back on top. This week, the original cryptocurrency cracked its all-time high, fueled by new ETFs backed by BlackRock and others that have elevated its status as a mainstream investment. That doesn’t mean, of course, that Bitcoin is totally safe. Aside from its historic volatility, Bitcoin is exposed to a few unique risks that are highly unlikely but potentially devastating should they materialize. The biggest of these is the return of its pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, who controls a vast hoard of Bitcoins from the currency’s earliest days, and who could shock the market in unprecedented ways.\nIt is widely assumed Satoshi will never return, but recent events—including a mysterious $1.2 million deposit to one of their wallets and an ongoing U.K. trial focused on their identity—are a reminder that unlikely does not mean impossible. Here’s a closer look at the odds Bitcoin’s creator could come back—and what it would mean if they did.\nSatoshi Nakamoto first flirted with fame with the publication of a white paper laying out the case for Bitcoin in 2008. After that, he or she or they was active in early online Bitcoin forums, and regularly emailed other developers until 2011 before going dark. Satoshi briefly surfaced one final time in 2014 to refute a news story that professed to discover their identity, but it’s been crickets ever since. \nIn disappearing from the scene, Satoshi also left untouched a large trove of Bitcoin wallets. These were amassed during a time when Bitcoin traded for less than $1 and when each new piece added to the blockchain yielded 50 coins (versus the three it will yield beginning next month). The transparent nature of the blockchain makes it possible to make a very good guess as to which wallets Satoshi controlled.\n“We estimate Satoshi’s funds total 1.124 million Bitcoin across about 36,000 wallets. That total has not changed over time,” the forensics firm Chainalysis told Fortune.\nThe company added that the wallets have been “dusted” with minimal amounts from time to time, which reflects the fact that, because wallet addresses are public, anyone can send Bitcoin to them.\nIn January, however, one of the Satoshi wallets received a gift that was decidedly not minimal—around $1.2 million worth of Bitcoin. The reason for the donation is a mystery. It’s possible it was simply a tribute by a wealthy crypto lover to mark Bitcoin’s 15th anniversary, but others have speculated more ominously that the size of the gift reflected an attempt by a governmental tax authority to ensnare Satoshi by giving authorities legal cause to issue subpoenas.\nBut even if this were the case, authorities would have to know whom to subpoena—raising the long-running question of who Satoshi is. Even 15 years later, the topic surfaces in the media on a semi-regular basis, most recently as the result of a pretender named Craig Wright who’s currently in midst of a trial in which he’s seeking to have a U.K. judge rule that he invented Bitcoin.\nAlthough Wright is clearly not Satoshi, the trial has obliged an early Bitcoin developer to furnish hundreds of emails between him and Satoshi. While the emails contain no smoking guns as to the latter’s identity, they do furnish a heap of additional evidence in the form of time stamps as well as quirks in spelling and syntax.\nThese additional clues are likely to reinforce the strongest existing hypothesis: that Satoshi is the libertarian polymath Nick Szabo, who likely created Bitcoin while working closely with Hal Finney, the late cryptographer who had his body cryogenically frozen—and whose interest in Bitcoin may have stemmed in part from wanting to have access to money if he returned to life.\nWhile mainstream speculation tends to overlook the Szabo-Finney theory in favor of more familiar names (Elon Musk is currently a fashionable choice) most of those involved in crypto since the early days will quietly concede the theory is true. The topic is somewhat taboo, however, among longtime Bitcoin believers—both because they prefer to treat the currency’s origin story as religious mystery, and because of a consensus that nothing good would come from exposing Satoshi.\nAs for Satoshi deciding to come forward on their own, the chances of that are extremely unlikely. Pete Rizzo, a Bitcoin historian who was an early editor-in-chief at CoinDesk, tells Fortune that Satoshi’s reemergence is about as likely as “an asteroid hitting the earth”—with the odds further declining the more time passes.\nRizzo is likely correct for two reasons. The first is ideological: Satoshi was a fervent believer in a decentralized system of money and, for Bitcoin to succeed, he had to remove himself from the picture. To return would be akin to proclaiming himself a king or, worse in the eyes of crypto believers, a central banker. The other reason Satoshi is highly unlikely to reveal himself is more practical: Doing so would attract a global swarm of criminals, crackpots, and tax inspectors—and who needs that?\nThe fact that Satoshi won’t voluntarily reveal himself doesn’t, however, eliminate the risk that a state authority could try to coerce him or one of his associates into disclosing who created Bitcoin. But given that 15 years have elapsed—and the fact that Satoshi is likely too wily to be caught this way—also makes this scenario improbable.\nSome have also raised the possibility that Satoshi could return in order to exert control over Bitcoin’s core code. That scenario, however, is all but impossible given the decentralized way the currency is maintained, and for the simple reason that if Satoshi had an ideological objection to how Bitcoin has evolved, they would have spoken up by now.\nAll of this, though, doesn’t account for a final wild card: Satoshi’s eventual death.\nSatoshi may be a true believer in the decentralized financial project known as Bitcoin, but he is also a human who very likely has family and loved ones. And like anyone with a large fortune, he’s likely to make arrangements to pass on his wealth.\nThis raises the question of what will happen to all of Satoshi’s Bitcoins—a fortune estimated to be at least $75 billion—when he passes. Seth Ginns, a partner at the prominent crypto investment firm CoinFund, says he has given the matter some thought—and made a guess at the most likely outcome.\nAccording to Ginns, Satoshi likely controls a number of other wallets from Bitcoin’s early days that are not counted among the cluster associated with him as assessed by Chainalysis and other forensic companies. Ginns suggests that Satoshi will quietly disburse these to his loved ones, and likely has done so already.\nWhat if Ginns’s guess is wrong though? What would happen if Satoshi now, or after his death, chose to liquidate his entire stash (“dump his bags” in crypto slang)? The mass unloading of over 1 million Bitcoins would certainly roil the market and tank prices.\nGinns, however, predicts that the market would absorb the shock and, in time, become even stronger since the selloff would result in Bitcoin becoming even more decentralized. But he also raised another intriguing scenario: that Satoshi has a so-called dead man’s switch to announce his death.\nThe idea of a dead man’s switch is pretty simple. It could involve a monthly or even yearly online activity—sending an email, updating a website, or whatever—that, if not performed, would trigger an automated scenario to occur. In the case of Satoshi, that could be an email from his long abandoned email address or an update to the original Bitcoin forum that he has died and elected to burn the keys to his wallets.\nIf this were to occur, Ginns says, the reaction in the market would likely be euphoria and a massive surge in the price as investors received confirmation Satoshi’s massive fortune was gone forever.\nAll of this is hypothetical, of course, as right now no one really knows for sure who Satoshi is or what—if anything—they plan to do with their huge stash of Bitcoins. The fact remains, however, that in assessing the risks of holding Bitcoin, investors must account for the future actions—and death—of its creator—and potentially a $75 billion swing.Learn more about all things crypto with short, easy-to-read lesson cards.

The technology achieved a remarkable 100% accuracy in identifying patients with Alzheimer's disease and individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), the clinical precursor, that developed Alzheimer's disease within 5 years.\nPublished in Frontiers in Neuroscience, the study represents a significant milestone in Resonant's strategic plans to provide accurate quantitative insights to patient care. Resonant is working toward making its diagnostic tools widely available for clinical neurodegenerative disease screening, research advancement, and direct consumer access for those seeking to optimize their brain health.\nResonant's team of researchers, led by co-founders Chad Pollard and Timothy Jenkins, PhD, are optimistic this technology will help physicians detect neurodegeneration earlier, which could lead to substantial improvements—in quality of life, treatment plans, and potential therapies—for patients living with Alzheimer's disease.\n\"Our research suggests that analyzing a simple blood draw can predict whether individuals with MCI will develop Alzheimer's disease within 5 years,\" says Jenkins, co-founder of Resonant. \"These data demonstrate significant potential for this technology's use as a clinically actionable predictor of neurodegeneration, which could allow for pre-symptomatic interventions. We believe that such early identification is the key to improving outcomes for patients with neurodegenerative disease.\"\nAlzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, affects an estimated 6.7 Americans aged 65 years and older, a number projected to nearly triple to 14 million by 2060. Early diagnoses, which will be essential to reduce disease burden, are extremely challenging due to the complexities of disease mechanisms.\nAlthough there is no dispute that the disease is characterized by neuron death, the utility of biomarkers of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's diagnostics has to date been limited by their lack of specificity. Resonant's assay, however, overcomes this challenge by analyzing neuron type-specific DNA in the blood.\nResonant is working to make sure its test will be broadly accessible, which will enable more comprehensive treatment strategies for neurodegenerative disease.\n\"Making diagnostic tests widely available will be essential to see meaningful changes in patient care and outcomes,\" says Pollard, co-founder of Resonant. \"Alzheimer's disease has historically been diagnosed by cognitive symptoms and the presence of proteins called amyloid beta and tau, but by the time these symptoms appear, the disease has progressed too far to significantly alter its trajectory. We are determined to change this.\"\nTo increase the assay's cell-specificity and predictive power in individuals with MCI, the researchers are currently improving their methods using proprietary DNA sequencing technology owned by Wasatch Biolabs (WBL), Resonant's clinical laboratory service provider.\nBeyond Alzheimer's disease, Resonant is also expanding the application of this technology to other neurodegenerative conditions with cell-specific pathologies such as Parkinson's Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease.\nResonant is committed to creating novel testing solutions for early detection to provide clinicians, researchers, and individuals with the tools to effectively diagnose, treat, and manage neurodegenerative disease. They expect to launch their Alzheimer's test in Q1 of 2024. \nAbout ResonantResonant is a subsidiary of Renew Biotechnologies that specializes in the identification and development of disruptive biotech innovations from the university setting. Resonant currently owns the intellectual property to multiple tests that accurately monitor neuron-derived DNA in the blood, as the amount of DNA released from dying neurons directly correlates with neurodegeneration. Using this technology, Resonant is working toward the development and distribution of diagnostic tests for several neurodegenerative conditions. Resonant's vision to slow these diseases meshes early, accurate diagnoses with clinically relevant therapeutic and lifestyle interventions. With the completion of their initial proof of concept studies in Alzheimer's disease, Resonant is actively working to bring their technology to patients of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative conditions, and to individuals seeking to mitigate their risk.\nAbout Frontiers in NeuroscienceFrontiers in Neuroscience is a leading journal in its field, publishing rigorously peer-reviewed research across specialties and disciplines within neuroscience.

Doctors say it’s only fair if they’re spending time on the messages and note that an email discussion can often save you the time of having to come in. \n The typical cost of an email message claim was $39 in 2021, including both the portion paid by insurance and by the patient, according to a Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker analysis. \n Some patients have been taken aback by the charges. They are surprised at the notifications on portals about the change, and irritated at the idea of a new fee. \n Dr. Lauren Oshman, a family physician and associate professor at the University of Michigan Medical School, says she initially experienced some patient resistance and anger about the prospect of being billed for emails. \n Now, she says, patients are typically pleased that they are able to get a direct response from her through a portal message. \n Doctors aren’t charging for every email. Federal guidelines typically followed by private insurers say that patients can only get charged for messages that require at least five minutes of a doctor’s time over the course of seven days. \n Billable messages also have to involve some sort of medical decision-making rather than deal with an administrative matter, like scheduling an appointment, according to those guidelines. And emails that stem from a follow-up to a visit, such as explaining lab results, aren’t typically billed. \n Health plans covered the full cost of about 82% of claims, according to the Peterson-KFF analysis. Patients who shared the cost paid $25 on average. \n The practice of charging for emails has steadily increased in the past few years, as the volume of emails that patients send has grown. A 2020 ruling from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services added billing codes that let medical providers get reimbursed for email correspondence that takes more than five minutes over the course of seven days and requires medical decision-making. That paved the way for private insurers that typically follow what CMS does. \n Medicare generally reimburses physicians $15 for messages that take five to 10 minutes; $30 for those that take 11 to 20 minutes; and $50 for those that take 21 or more minutes. \n Most patients with traditional Medicare plans won’t face any out-of-pocket costs, says A Jay Holmgren, an assistant professor in the department of medicine at University of California San Francisco and the Center for Clinical Informatics and Improvement Research. But people with commercial health insurance will pay something akin to a copay—unless they have a high deductible plan, in which case they will typically absorb the full cost. \n Jennifer Ann Falandys, a 41-year-old who lives outside of Buffalo, N.Y., says she typically emails her doctors at University of Rochester Complex Care Center once or twice a week. Falandys says she has cerebral palsy, lung complications and generalized anxiety disorder, among other things. \n “Patients like me who are complex patients, we require a lot of interaction,\" says Falandys, who is a disability advocate. \n “It just feels a little intimidating when you open the portal and the first thing it says is ‘be aware, we’re going to bill,’\" she says. “We have to send these messages and we shouldn’t have to think to ourselves, ‘Should I send this?’\" \n The University of Washington Medicine health system started charging for patient emails over the summer. \n The volume of emails has been growing over the past decade, says Dr. Crystal Wong, a family medicine doctor and associate chief digital officer at the University of Washington in Seattle. The system received 1.5 million messages through its portal in 2022, she says. \n “I do this on my lunch break, I do this in between patients, I do this at night or in the morning before clinic,\" she says of responding to patient emails. “It is an amount of work that we need to acknowledge is real.\" \n Wong says a small percentage of emails—only 1% to 2%—is billed. Those typically include medical issues that are safe to handle over the MyChart portal system, such as a rash with attached photos, or questions about a medication or supplement. \n For more serious health issues such as acute abdominal pain, it’s important for patients to visit in person, says Wong. “I need to look at you and do a good old-fashioned exam,\" she says. \n Oshman of the University of Michigan said that if patient messages take her less than five minutes, she doesn’t bill for them. \n However, some involve a back-and-forth that takes more than five minutes of her time over seven days. These may require her to review several past notes or another doctor’s notes and make a medical decision. \n For instance, as an obesity medicine specialist, she may assess a patient’s response to medication and lifestyle changes and recommend dose changes. Or she might diagnose and treat a urinary tract infection, a rash, or manage treatment for patients with depression or anxiety. \n “Out of every 10 messages, one or two of them are messages that take me a long time to answer properly,\" she says. \n\t\t\tThe Medical Bill You Never Expected: Doctors Now Charge for Emails","length":6342,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T10:29:20+05:30","rating":[5,7,6,7,8,6,7],"reason":"The article provides a factual overview of the trend of doctors charging for email responses to patients.

Well, obviously not if you’re on the receiving end…\nSaturday 2 March 2024 saw two dramatic last-minute winners scored in the Premier League, with both Liverpool’s Darwin Núñez and West Ham’s Tomás Soucek netting in the final minute of matches against Nottingham Forest and Everton respectively to seal victories for their sides.\nWith 90th-minute winning goals on everyone’s minds, we look back at the various stats, facts and records surrounding them in Premier League history.\nWhich Team Has Scored the Most Last-Minute Winners in Premier League History?\nLiverpool lead the way here, with 44 of their Premier League wins decided by a goal in the 90th minute or later. The latest of those came via Núñez last-gasp winner at Nottingham Forest – the club’s latest winning goal on record and the tenth latest goal in recorded Premier League history.\nThe Uruguayan’s strike was the third added-time winner for Liverpool in the Premier League this season, following his winning goal at Newcastle United in August and Harvey Elliot’s winner at Crystal Palace on 9 December. \nLiverpool are one of three teams to have won matches in second-half added time this season in the Premier League, alongside Tottenham and Manchester United, while Núñez is one of three players to have scored more than one last-minute winner in 2023-24 alongside Arsenal’s Declan Rice and West Ham midfielder Soucek.\nSoucek’s goal on Saturday gave West Ham a 2-1 lead in added time, before teammate Edson Álvarez added another in the 95th-minute to seal a 3-1 victory at Goodison Park versus Everton.\nThose goals from Núñez and Soucek took the seasonal tally to 22 match-winning goals scored in the Premier League this season – just four away from the all-time record within a single season, set in 2021-22 (26).\nWhich Team Has Conceded the Most Last-Minute Winners in Premier League History?\nTottenham’s defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux on 11 November 2023 was the 27th time in Premier League history that they have lost a match to an opposition side’s 90th-minute winning goal. In fact, Spurs were winning that match 1-0 in second-half added time, before goals from Pablo Sarabia (90+1) and Mario Lemina (90+7) stole all three points for Wolves.\nSoucek’s strike for West Ham at Everton on 2 March was the 21st time that the Toffees have lost a Premier League match via a goal in second half added time, taking them above both Fulham and West Ham in the rankings.\nDespite playing in every Premier League season, Manchester United have only conceded six 90+ minute goals that proved to be winners – just one of those came in the Alex Ferguson era, courtesy of Thierry Henry’s last-gasp winner for Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium in January 2007. In fact, three of those six games lost to last-minute winners have been against Arsenal.\nAlex Iwobi’s strike at Old Trafford on 24 February saw Fulham beat Man Utd 2-1. That was the just the second last-minute winner that the Red Devils have conceded at Old Trafford in the Premier League and the first since Patrick van Aanholt for Crystal Palace in August 2019.\nSix different players have scored as many as four last-minute winners in Premier League history, but just one of those is currently playing in the competition: Marcus Rashford.\nWinners versus Hull City (August 2016), Bournemouth (November 2018), Wolves (December 2020) and West Ham (January 2022) mean that with one more 90th-minute winning goal, he could go outright top in Premier League history among all players.\nHe currently shares the lead with five other players: Steven Gerrard, Ian Wright, Christian Benteke, Papiss Demba Cissé and Sadio Mané. All-time leading Premier League scorer Alan Shearer scored three winning goals in the 90th minute or later, as did Henry, Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler, Harry Kane and Robin van Persie alongside nine others.\nBen Foster was on the receiving end of the most 90th-minute winning goals in Premier League history, conceding 13 overall. That’s one more than David James and Joe Hart and two more than Brad Friedel and Lukasz Fabianski.\nNo Premier League stadium has witnessed more 90th-minute winners than Anfield. Of the 28 scored at Liverpool’s iconic stadium, 22 have been scored by the Reds. The last visiting player to score a 90th-minute winning goal at Anfield in the Premier League was Robin van Persie for Arsenal on 3 March 2012, which handed the Gunners a 2-1 victory on Merseyside.\nIt’s the other stadium on Merseyside that’s witnessed the next most, with Everton’s Goodison Park seeing 24 last-minute winners in Premier League history – nine by the opposition and 14 in their favour. Liverpool have scored three of these, thanks to goals from Gary McAllister (April 2001), Dirk Kuyt (October 2007) and Mané (December 2016).\nDavid Moyes has been in charge of 33 Premier League matches that have been decided by a goal in the 90th minute or later. Twenty-one of those have been in his favour, with the win for his West Ham side at Everton on Saturday 2 March equalling Arsène Wenger’s all-time record in the competition. \nRoy Hodgson (13) is the only manager to have lost more Premier League games via last-minute winners than Moyes (12), but with the oldest manager in Premier League history having left Crystal Palace in February, it seems unlikely he’ll suffer any more.\nFerguson won 16 Premier League matches as Manchester United boss via goals scored in the 90th minute or later across his tenure in charge of the club. He lost 114 games overall in the Premier League, but just one of those came via a 90th-minute goal – the aforementioned Arsenal win via Henry’s strike at the Emirates in 2007.\nAfter that 1-0 victory over Nottingham Forest on 2 March, Jürgen Klopp has seen his Liverpool side win 18 matches with last-minute goals – the most in the competition since his arrival at the Reds in October 2015.\nEnjoy this?

Sunscreens and dry shampoos too. Now acne treatments are joining the list of widely used consumer products found to contain high levels of the chemical linked to cancer.\nAcne products from brands including Proactiv, Target Corp.’s Up & Up and Clinique have elevated levels of the carcinogen, an independent testing laboratory said in a petition filed with the US Food and Drug Administration late Tuesday. The lab asked the FDA to recall the affected treatments — all of which contain the active ingredient benzoyl peroxide — while regulators investigate. \nBenzene is a natural component of gasoline and tobacco smoke and can cause leukemia in high amounts, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over the past three years it’s been detected in several popular products, heightening consumers’ awareness of the potential threats in their bathroom cabinets and raising questions about the FDA’s oversight of the industry. Companies including Johnson & Johnson, Unilever Plc and Procter & Gamble Co. have recalled products.\nNew Haven, Connecticut-based Valisure LLC, the testing laboratory that filed Tuesday’s petition and uncovered the previous risks, has positioned itself as a gatekeeper for consumers. Valisure gained prominence conducting product research and has deals with large health-care systems, including Kaiser Permanente and the US Department of Defense, to test drugs used by their members and weed out substandard treatments. \nFor its acne research, Valisure tested 66 benzoyl peroxide products, including creams, lotions, gels and washes available either over the counter from major retailers or via prescription. While FDA guidelines allow up to 2 parts per million of benzene, Valisure found up to nine times that amount in some treatments. Those levels jumped significantly when the products were tested at higher temperatures designed to replicate how they might break down over time, for example if stored in a medicine cabinet in a steamy bathroom.\nProactiv’s 2.5% benzoyl peroxide cream, manufactured by Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., contained as much as 1,761 parts per million of benzene during Valisure’s stability testing, while a similar cream from Target reached 1,598 parts per million and a treatment from Estee Lauder Cos.’s Clinique hit 401 parts per million. A 10% benzoyl peroxide cream from Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc’s Clearasil initially tested just at the FDA limit, but jumped to 308 parts per million of benzene after being exposed to high temperatures for more than two weeks. “Reckitt is confident that all Clearasil products, when used and stored as directed on their labels, are safe,” the company said in a statement. The safety and quality of products are its top priority, Reckitt said. It didn’t answer questions about whether it had tested its acne cream for benzene.\nRepresentatives for the FDA, Taro Pharmaceuticals and Estee Lauder didn’t respond to requests for comment. Target declined to comment. Reckitt fell 2% and Unilever dipped 0.4% in London, while Estee Lauder slid 1.3% and Taro tumbled 2.4% at the close in New York.\nAcne is the most common skin condition in the U.S., and affects as many as 50 million people each year, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. The numbers are even higher among teenagers and young adults: about 85% of those aged 12 to 24 have some form of the condition. \nSales of over-the-counter US acne treatments totaled $1 billion last year, almost double the $593 million in sales in 2019, data from Chicago-based market research firm Circana showed. The AAD guidelines name benzoyl peroxide as one of its top recommendations for treating acne topically. \nValisure President David Light said the contamination happens because benzoyl peroxide can break down and form benzene.\n“This has been well known for a long time,” he said in an interview. “All that was needed was for someone to check on it.”  \nLight is listed as an inventor on a patent filed last year for a method to prevent benzoyl peroxide from breaking down into benzene in drug products. The lab tested other kinds of acne products with different ingredients, mainly salicylic acid, and did not find elevated benzene levels in those. \nValisure’s most high-profile investigation was into heartburn drug Zantac, which the FDA pulled from the market along with generic versions in 2020, months after the lab discovered the drug’s active ingredient — ranitidine — could form a probable carcinogen called NDMA.\nThe FDA has questioned Valisure’s testing methods in the past. Specifically, the agency has said the independent lab should follow the same process that drug manufacturers use, which tends to be costlier than the way that Valisure tests.\nValisure stands behind its testing methods and points to its certification from the International Organization for Standardization, which sets testing guidelines for all kinds of products including drugs. In a statement Wednesday, Valisure said the results from its research on acne treatments were most similar to its investigation into those ranitidine products.\n“The benzene we found in sunscreens and other consumer products were impurities that came from contaminated ingredients; however, the benzene in benzoyl peroxide products is coming from the benzoyl peroxide itself,” Light said in the statement.\nIn 2022, following Valisure’s previous benzene findings, the FDA warned companies that they should assess the risk of the chemical forming in their own products. The agency doesn’t regularly test products it oversees. \n“The discovery made by Valisure regarding benzoyl peroxide acne treatment products is deeply troubling and gives renewed importance to the need to empower the FDA to immediately act once we are made aware of the dangers of prescription or over-the-counter drugs,” US Representative Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said in a statement. “Benzoyl peroxide products saturate the current market and millions of consumers are unknowingly using a product that increases their exposure to life-threatening carcinogens.”DeLauro has attempted to push legislation that would give the FDA the authority to recall drugs rather than negotiate with companies to do so on a voluntary basis.\nValisure’s testing also examined benzene in the air surrounding acne treatments and found that even an unopened Proactiv product leaked high levels when kept at 104 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of a hot shower, for almost 17 hours. The Environmental Protection Agency has said inhaling benzene at levels of 0.4 parts per billion chronically over a lifetime could result in one additional cancer per 100,000 people, a measure of risk the FDA also uses. Subscribe to Well Adjusted, our newsletter full of simple strategies to work smarter and live better, from the Fortune Well team.

It’s not exactly accurate to say that Dune is unfilmable, but the book and its sequel are exceedingly heady philosophical exercises that don’t play well to adaptation. Denis Villeneuve’s first Dune took an admirable stab at the novel’s first half, often succumbing to the unwieldy weight of exposition and the sheer scope of the cast.\nThe back half of Dune is a bit more of an intimate affair. With Leto (Oscar Isaac) dead, the exiled Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) and Lady Jessica (Rebecca Ferguson) find a new home among the Fremen, who dedicate their lives to disrupting the spice production now returned to House Harkonnen after they usurped House Atreides. One of the Fremen leaders Stilgar (Javier Bardem) is convinced that Paul is their messiah, quickly inserting Lady Jessica into the mechanics of their political world as the new Reverend Mother.\nDune is a very dense text. Villeneuve does an excellent job breaking the material down for casual audiences, even if much of the nuances of groups like the Bene Gesserit is lost in the pacing. The women of the film, particularly Lady Jessica and Chiani (Zendaya) provide most of the emotional backbone of the narrative, often exposing the flaws of the White Savior trope in the process. Herbert’s writing spent a lot of time focusing on prophecy that a film doesn’t really have time to explore. The book has the luxury of presenting Paul’s ascendency over hundreds of pages as a matter of fate. The abridged runtime makes for a far more awkward presentation of a young teenager as the messiah of this rich world.\nVilleneuve shows off his confidence with a relaxed sense of pacing, leaning heavily on the exceptional cinematography to carry the narrative instead of Herbert’s densely packed plotting. Part Two cuts a lot of stuff out, often to the point of making you wonder why the first film spent so much time on unnecessary exposition. There is something beautiful about the way Villeneuve focuses on the beauty of Arrakis instead of trying to cover as much material as possible.\nThe film does buckle under its obligations to function more like a blockbuster film than an exercise in philosophy. The limits of its 165-minute runtime are quite exposed when the narrative leaves Arrakis for a bit to focus on the Emperor (Christopher Walken) and House Harkonnen. Feyd-Rautha is a flimsy, underdeveloped villain, a shame given Austin Butler’s obvious enthusiasm in the role. Stellan Skarsgård does an admirable job as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, making the most of a limited runtime, but there’s an obligatory sense to the villainy that the film never quite shakes.\nThe action sequences are a bit of a mixed bag, much like the first film. The individual fight choreography is quite good, but the broader battles leave a lot to be desired. The cinematography of the actual fighting pales in comparison to the simpler frames showcasing the planet. The sandworms themselves aren’t given the same beautiful care and attention as they received in the first film.\nMany popular science-fiction films have riffed off Dune’s basic premise over the years. Paul suffers from the weight of so many who came before him. Villeneuve never truly sells his lead as this necessary messiah figure, a reality exacerbated by the excessive amount of parental figures he has in the film, including Lady Jessica, Stilgar, and Gurney Halleck (Josh Brolin).  All three work hard to sell Paul as a figure of destiny, but Chalamet is rarely given much space to run with the ball. Zendaya is a much more satisfying emotional care of the film, an awkward reality that the source material can’t really compensate for.\nVilleneuve spends so much time capturing the feel of Arrakis that he sometimes forgets that the audience needs to feel something toward Paul, perhaps the weakest character among the principal cast. It’s not necessarily Villeneuve’s fault that audiences are bound to be familiar with the Luke Skywalker’s and the Neo’s of the world who owe so much to Herbert’s work, but the headiness of Paul’s character is quite lost in the shuffle. One has to wonder if some of the time spent on characters who only appeared in the first movie might have been better allocated to the newcomers in Part Two whose introductions feel quite rushed.\nDune probably needed three movies to get everything right. As it stands, Part Two is a very good film. Casual moviegoers may find themselves checked out at times, especially when Florence Pugh’s Irulan swoops in for what’s essentially an important extended cameo, but Villeneuve delivered a worthy adaptation of Herbert’s work. Some of the material’s inherent flaws are products of its time, as well as Hollywood’s reluctance to invest in newer work. Paul’s weaknesses as a messiah somewhat reflect the reality that our society has moved beyond some of the confines of Herbert’s sandbox. Villeneuve has crafted a beautiful film that will likely go down as the definitive take on the franchise, while also exposing many of the flaws that demonstrate why it took so long to get made in the first place.","length":5292,"publishedTime":"2024-03-01T18:49:24+00:00","rating":[6,8,7,6,7,6,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed analysis of \"Dune: Part Two,\" discussing various aspects of the film adaptation.

Heavenly Delusion scored nominations for Best New Anime, Best Director (Hirotaka Mori), Best Cinematography, Best Drama and Best Opening Sequence (for \"innocent arrogance\" by BiSH). Meanwhile, Vinland Saga Season 2 earned nominations for Anime of the Year, Best Continuing Series, Best Cinematography, Best Drama and Best Main Character (Thorfinn). Unfortunately, both titles failed to net a single win, frequently losing out to MAPPA's iconic shonen series Jujutsu Kaisen.\n Related Crunchyroll Reveals Simulcast Release Date for Kaiju No. 8 Following New Trailer Shonen Jump smash hit Kaiju No. 8 has revealed a new trailer & release date for the Godzilla-inspired anime series, which Crunchyroll will simulcast. \nInitially released in 2020, Jujutsu Kaisen is one of the most popular ongoing shonen anime of the modern era. Thanks to JJK's lovable characters, thrilling storyline and breathtakingly detailed animation, fans continue to support the anime despite the numerous controversies surrounding Studio MAPPA. The 2024 Crunchyroll Anime Awards strongly affirmed Jujutsu Kaisen's icon status; the series came out on top in 11 different categories, shattering My Hero Academia's previous record from 2018.\n JJK's Huge Success Overshadowed Anime Like Vinland Saga & Heavenly Delusion \nJujutsu Kaisen's triumph at the 2024 Crunchyroll Awards provoked mixed reactions on social media. While many feel that JJK was entitled to its wins, plenty of others felt that both Vinland Saga and Heavenly Delusion have been tragically overlooked. In the latter's case, the overall sentiment appears to be that Heavenly Delusion's production values and storyline were just as good, if not better, than JJK, making it deserving of at least one win. Deeming the losses unusually suspect, one person accused Crunchyroll of unfairly skewing results in favor of certain series and creators. Others pointed out that Heavenly Delusion contains certain elements -- such as fanservice and graphic sexual violence -- that can hinder its appeal for certain audiences.\n Related Crunchyroll Looks to Spring 2024 in New Streaming Reveals With KonoSuba Season 3 and More Crunchyroll announces a host of new streaming titles for its Spring 2024 slate, including the highly anticipated debut of KonoSuba Season 3. \nThe collective outrage from Vinland Saga fans seems to be even more prominent, with many X (formerly Twitter) posts expressing frustration and dismay on behalf of the series. Dozens of posts refer to the anime as either a \"10/10 masterpiece\" or \"one of the best series they have ever seen\" -- impressive accolades for a work that has considerably less name recognition than JujutsuKaisen or Chainsaw Man. As with Heavenly Delusion, many Vinland Saga fans placed the blame squarely on Crunchyroll. However, one X user urged their fellows to take the losses in stride, arguing that Vinland Saga's \"caliber surpasses the need for awards.\"\nHeavenly Delusion tells the story of a boy named Tokio who lives in safety and security behind Tokyo's protective walls. Meanwhile, the world outside is a hellish apocalyptic landscape filled with monsters. Vinland Saga Season 2 is a historical drama revolving around a Nordic Viking named Thorfinn. After being sold into slavery, he goes through a harrowing period of self-reflection as he contemplates the decisions that led to his downfall. Heavenly Delusion is available exclusively on Hulu/Disney+.

From edited “deepfake” videos made on smartphones to vast foreign-led information operations, politics and elections show how varied disinformation can be.\nHailed as “the year of elections”, with the majority of the world’s population going to the polls, including in South Africa, 2024 will also be a year of lessons learnt, where we will see whether disinformation can truly subvert our political processes or if we are more resilient than we think.\nThe dissemination of disinformation, as well as misleading content and methods, is not always hi-tech. We often think about social networking, manipulated media and sophisticated espionage in this regard, but sometimes efforts can be very low budget. In 2019, publications with names that sounded like newspapers were posted through letterboxes across the UK. These news publications, however, do not exist.\nBearing headlines such as “90% back remain”, they were imitation newspapers created and disseminated by the UK’s major political parties. These types of publication, which some voters thought were legitimate news publications, led to the Electoral Commission describing this technique as “misleading”.\nThe News Media Association, the body which represents local and regional media, also wrote to the Electoral Commission calling for the ban of “fake local newspapers”.\nResearch has shown that for some topics, such as politics and civil rights, all figures across the political spectrum are often both attacked and supported, in an attempt to cause confusion and to obfuscate who and what can be believed.\nThis practice often goes hand-in-hand with something called “zone flooding”, where the information environment is deliberately overloaded with any and all information, just to confuse people. The aim of these broad disinformation campaigns is to make it difficult for people to believe any information, leading to a disengaged and potentially uninformed electorate.\nHostile state information operations and disinformation from abroad will continue to threaten countries such as the UK and US. Adversarial countries such as Russia, China and Iran continuously seek to subvert trust in our institutions and processes with the goal of increasing apathy and resentment.\nJust two weeks ago, the US congressional Republicans’ impeachment proceedings against President Joe Biden began to fall apart when it was revealed that a witness was supplied with false information by Russian intelligence officials.\nRecently, there has been increased focus on the role of artificial intelligence in spreading disinformation. AI allows computers to carry out tasks that could previously have only been done by humans. So AI and AI-enabled tools can carry out very sophisticated tasks with low effort from humans and at low cost.\nRead: AI deepfakes and SA’s fight to protect the 2024 election\nDisinformation can be both mediated and enabled by AI. Bad actors can use sophisticated algorithms to identify and target swathes of people with disinformation on social media platforms. One key focus, however, has been on generative AI, the use of this technology to produce text and media that seem as if they were created by a human.\nThis can vary from using tools such as ChatGPT to write social media posts, to using AI-powered image, video and audio generation tools to create media of politicians in embarrassing, but fabricated situations. This encompasses what are known as “deepfakes”, which can vary from poor to convincing in their quality.\nWhile some say that AI will shape the coming elections in ways we can’t yet understand, others think the effects of disinformation are exaggerated. The simple reality is that, at present, we do not know how AI will affect the year of elections.\nWe could see vast deception at a scale only previously imagined, or this could be a Y2K moment, where our fears simply do not come to fruition. We are at a pivotal moment and the extent to which these elections are affected, or otherwise, will inform our regulatory and policy decisions for years to come.\nIf 2024 is the year of elections, then 2025 is likely to be the year of reflections. Reflecting on how susceptible our democracies are to disinformation, whether as societies we are vulnerable to sweeping deception and manipulation, and how we can safeguard our future elections.\nWhether it’s profoundly consequential or simply something that bubbles under the surface, disinformation will always exist. But the coming year will determine whether it’s top of the agenda for governments, journalists and educators to tackle, or simply something that we learn to live with.\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons licence","length":4984,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T08:28:49+02:00","rating":[8,7,8,7,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information on the various forms of disinformation, including real-life examples and the impact on political processes.

Less than 24 hours after landing on Thai soil, he was sent from Bangkok Remand Prison to the Police General Hospital for treatment of unidentified health issues. He stayed at the hospital until his release on parole on February 18.\nDuring his exile, Thaksin was sentenced in absentia to eight years in prison for corruption stemming from his 2001-2006 tenure as prime minister, which was cut short by a military coup. However, he received a royal pardon soon after his return to Thailand last year, which reduced the sentence to one year in jail.\nThaksin’s reason to visit his home province is to pay homage to his ancestors, according to his daughter Paetongtarn, who is the Pheu Thai leader.\nHe is expected to meet with PM Srettha, who is scheduled to fly to Chiang Mai on Friday afternoon. The prime minister’s schedule includes an inspection of the northern city’s PM 2.5 dust pollution situation. Srettha is scheduled to leave Chiang Mai for its neighbouring province of Lamphun on Saturday morning for a mobile Cabinet meeting.\nOn February 24, less than a week after Thaksin was released, the prime minister called on the ex-PM at the latter’s Bangkok mansion on a “private visit” that lasted over an hour.","length":3067,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T13:39:00+07:00","rating":[5,6,6,5,7,6,5],"reason":"The article provides accurate information regarding former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra's activities, including his trip to Chiang Mai and the accusations made against him.

There are similar pamphlets in several other countries, and prevention of child abuse is certainly a commendable aim.However, the pamphlets distributed in Japan in 2024 refer to a peculiar notion of “child abuse” and include in it also typical manifestations of conservative religion. Some passages specifically, without mentioning any religious group by name, seems to target the Unification Church (now called the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification), the Jehovah’s Witnesses, and the Roman Catholic Church.Their meaning is, in certain  parts, obscure but becomes clearer when one compares them to  the “Q&A on Handling Child Abuse and Similar Cases Related to Religious and Similar Beliefs” published at the end of 2022 by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. In fact, these “Q&A” were sent to all boards of education in Japan and it is in accordance with them that schools began distributing the illustrated pamphlets on child abuse.These “Q&A,” as a well-known journalist specialized in Japanese issues, Leo Lewis, noted in the “Financial Times,” were clearly designed to “break down” the Unification Church and prevent it from passing its faith to the next generations. However, whoever drafted them also took into account post-Abe-assassination attacks against the Jehovah’s Witness and conservative Christian groups. As Lewis concluded, “in its rush to enact something, Japan has skipped some extraordinarily nuanced theological questions and created potential trouble for a much larger circle of organizations and activities than it has bargained for.”The pamphlets make the situation even worse. They explain to children that the “forced participation in religious activities” is a case of “abuse.” The adjective “forced,” however, is ambiguous. It evokes the “religious police” that in some Muslim countries goes around the streets on Friday and brings forcibly to the mosques citizens who don’t want to go there. This is certainly an abuse, because adult citizens have a right to freely dispose of their spare time. However, minors do not normally organize their time freely. It is generally regarded as appropriate that parents supervise it. If it was not so, some minors may be tempted to devote little time to studying and much more to having fun. Minors are normally brought to church by their parents. They may be more or less enthusiastic about it, but the parents’ action in these cases is not an “abuse.” The pamphlets explain that children are abused by being “forced to participate in religious activities” and “threatened by words like ‘You will go to hell.’”If the reference is to involving minors in missionary activities, this is something happening in most churches. The Vatican’s website, for example, presents the activities of IMAC, the International Movement of Apostolate of Children, a Vatican-approved umbrella organization that supervises the evangelistic activities of children, based on the principle that “children are already fully persons, capable of transforming the world around them.”Children are also told in the pamphlets that they should be alert and report those who “show them materials that contain sexual expression that are not appropriate to your age.” A casual reader may believe this is about pornography or adult magazines, but a look at the controversies in the Japanese media on the Jehovah’s Witnesses and conservative Christian groups after the Abe assassination helps understanding that the reference is really to Biblical stories about adultery and other sexual sins and the corresponding illustrations in Christian publications. Obviously, not all Biblical accounts are appropriate for a five-year-old, while in 2024 no 17-year-old minor would be scandalized by them. It is also paradoxical that these comments are made in Japan, a country that has been repeatedly at the receiving end of criticism by the United Nations agency for the protection of children UNICEF for the large circulation and availability to minors in the country of comics and cartoons with inappropriate sexual content. Yet, religions and the Bible are singled out here. Among cases of child sexual abuse, being exposed to “materials that contain sexual expression that are not appropriate to your age” and being induced to “talk about sexual experiences” are listed.Another reference in the pamphlets is to those who induce “children to talk about sexual experiences.” Again, one may imagine that the implied reference is to pedophiles inciting minors to tell salacious stories. But a look at the 2022 ministerial Q&A would show that in fact what is denounced is confession if minors confess sexual sins. Any Catholic priest with experience in hearing confessions of teenagers would agree that they “mostly” confess sins related to sex. It is difficult to imagine a 16-yar-old confessing tax evasion or paying bribes to a public officer. The pamphlets thus directly attack the confession as practiced in the Catholic Church, where it starts at age seven, and in several other Christian churches. Confession of sexual sins even goes under the category of “sexual abuse.”Without naming them, the reference in the pamphlets to inducing children to “avoid blood transfusions” when prescribed by doctors directly targets the Jehovah’s Witnesses. They believe blood transfusions are against the Bible and recommend alternative therapies, which are easily available in medically advanced countries, including Japan. They, together with conservative Christian groups, may also be targeted by the pamphlets when the latter tell minors that “restricting going to higher education” is another form of abuse or neglect. Conservative groups are often critical of certain trends in modern universities, although in the cases of the Jehovah’s Witnesses international scholarly studies have demonstrated that a sizeable percentage of them do go to college. The question is debatable, but again having different opinions on modern universities is not “child abuse or neglect.” “Not being given blood transfusions” prescribed by doctors is explicitly mentioned as a case of “neglect.”The most bizarre and alarming references in the pamphlets are those regarding as “abuse” telling children that if they “do or don’t do” certain things they “will go to hell.” This is a very common teaching in conservative Christian churches and in other religions as well. Although perhaps less fashionable now, Christians of my generation remember how parents, as well as priests and pastors at Catholic Catechism or Protestant Sunday School did tell children that those who commit serious sins go to hell.If instilling the fear of hell is a form of “child abuse” perhaps Dante’s “Comedy,” with its graphic depictions of hell, should be forbidden to minors in Japan, and Japanese travel agents should not take families with minors to the famous Medieval Cemetery of Pisa or to countless European cathedrals whose frescos or paintings show how devils will torment the sinners in the afterlife (Buddhist depictions of Cold Hells are not less terrifying, by the way). Both the Vatican-endorsed Catholic catechism for children YOUCAT and countless teaching aids for conservative Protestant Sunday Schools do teach that hell exists, is “horrible to contemplate” (YOUCAT, no. 53), and that those who commit serious sins and do not repent may end up there.The pamphlets stretch the notion of “abuse” in an almost caricatural way to assault the right of conservative Christian parents to transmit their religion to their children. Article 18 no. 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Japan has signed and ratified, states that “the States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to have respect for the liberty of parents and, when applicable, legal guardians to ensure the religious and moral education of their children in conformity with their own convictions.” Japan has signed and ratified the ICCPR. Distributing such pamphlets to schoolchildren is a blatant violation of Article 18 no. 4. It should not be allowed.","length":8617,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T01:04:00+00:00","rating":[6,5,5,5,6,5,4],"reason":"The article provides a detailed analysis of the pamphlets distributed in Japan regarding child abuse and their implications on religious activities, particularly targeting conservative Christian groups.

The registration period expired on February 29.\nThe Panamanian corporate registry shows that Gonzalez is an officer of Melaj Offshore and that the power of attorney for the firm belongs to her husband, Augustine Jackson.\nThe tug and the barge have a history of towing Venezuelan oil. The barge’s final, fateful voyage saw it take some 35,000 barrels of oil on a voyage that was meant to end in Guyana, but along the way, the barge ran into difficulties.\nAfter the 48-year-old barge capsized off the coast of Tobago, the oil slick spread hundreds of kilometres west and reached the east coast of the Dutch Caribbean island of Bonaire and later Aruba and Grenada. Curaçao is another island currently on alert.\nLast Friday, Bonaire’s acting governor Nolly Oleana said that clean-up efforts are in full swing. Oil has washed up periodically on the island’s eastern coastlines but has not made it to the dive sites and heavily trafficked tourist areas on the island’s western side. She has pointed out that more oil could spill into several inlets on the island.\nThe island officials are working with the government of Trinidad and Tobago regarding compensation for the spill.\n“We are in contact with Trinidad and Tobago.

Lawson and other East Bay lawmakers have introduced […]","textContent":"To ensure Rhode Islanders receive reliable, constant, and comprehensive updates regarding the status of the Washington Bridge, Senate Majority Whip Valarie J. Lawson and other East Bay lawmakers have introduced legislation requiring regular monthly reports from the Rhode Island Department of Transportation.\n“For my constituents in East Providence, and for residents across East Bay communities, the weeks since the sudden closure of the westbound side of Washington Bridge have been filled with enormous disruptions to daily life. Businesses have seen steep declines in patronage, neighborhoods have been flooded with traffic, and local services have been placed under incredible strain,” said Whip Lawson (D-Dist. 14, East Providence).\nShe continued, “My colleagues and I are seeking to ensure that everyone impacted by this situation – in the East Bay and across Rhode Island – receives timely, thorough information about the status of the bridge, the plans for its future, the timeline involved, and the steps being taken to alleviate traffic while work continues. The legislation we are introducing today takes a thoughtful approach to providing Rhode Islanders with transparency and predictability.”\nSimilar to a bill introduced recently in the House of Representatives, the legislation (2024-S 2727) would mandate that RIDOT provide monthly reports on developments related to the Washington Bridge to the General Assembly. It is sponsored by Whip Lawson and co-sponsored by East Providence Senators Pamela J. Lauria and Robert Britto, as well as Senate Judiciary Committee Chairwoman Dawn Euer (D-Dist. 13, Newport, Jamestown), Senate Committee on Special Legislation & Veterans’ Affairs Committee Chairman Walter S. Felag Jr. (D-Dist. 10, Bristol, Tiverton, Warren), Senator Linda L. Ujifusa (D-Dist. 11, Portsmouth, Bristol), Senate Committee on Rules, Government Ethics & Oversight Chairman Mark P. McKenney (D-Dist. 30, Warwick), and Senate Committee on Finance Chairman Louis P. DiPalma (D-Dist. 12, Little Compton, Middletown, Newport, Tiverton).\nThe Senate legislation would require the first report be submitted within 30 days of the legislation being signed into law. It would also require that the report include information regarding any alternative routes or means of transportation being utilized to reduce traffic across the bridge, such as ferry service. Additionally, the legislation would require that overtime costs for schools submitted for reimbursement – in addition to costs for traffic details, police, fire, rescue, and other related services – be included in the reporting associated with the bridge closure and related disruptions.\n“Having the most current and complete information possible when it comes to the Washington Bridge is not just a courtesy. For us who reside in East Providence, it is an absolute necessity. We need that information to go about our daily lives – getting to work or doctors’ appointments, or just getting across town. This is an extremely difficult situation, and I am very grateful to everyone who has responded to help – especially members of our East Bay communities who have stepped up to assist their neighbors. Together, we will get through this and find ways to minimize the impacts as much as possible for everyone who is affected,” said Senator Britto (D-Dist. 18, East Providence, Pawtucket).\n“Residents of the East Bay are rightfully frustrated, and they deserve the fullest possible picture of how the Washington Bridge closure is being addressed. I feel their frustration as I drive this route every day. Above all, the lack of predictability too many Rhode Islanders are experiencing while simply living their day-to-day routines and obligations is simply unacceptable. Safety is absolutely the top priority, but we must also adequately inform and empower our constituents to cope with this situation. I am proud to work with Whip Lawson and Senator Britto on this bill, and I will continue to work with all leaders and stakeholders to find the best possible solutions for my constituents and all Rhode Islanders,” said Senator Lauria (D-Dist. 32, Barrington, Bristol, East Providence).\nThe legislation has been referred to the Senate Committee on Rules, Government Ethics & Oversight.","length":4411,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T16:46:18Z","rating":[6,7,8,5,8,7,6],"reason":"- The article provides accurate information about the introduction of legislation by Senate Majority Whip Valarie J.

The land was purchased in 2014 and the tree was planted in 2016.\n Wayne Fariss, Fort Johnson Integrated Training Area Management program coordinator, demonstrates the soil quality within the training area\n Wayne Fariss has always had a solid base for his career aspirations, literally …. the dirt.\n “Everything that happens, it’s growing on top of this important resource – the dirt. I care about the dirt,” said Fariss, who runs the Integrated Training Area Management program at Fort Johnson, Louisiana. “The trees are growing on it; the flora and fauna are too. Embedded in it are pre-historic archeological resources. All of these are important purposes.”\n “But the mission, and why this dirt is owned by the U.S. government, is to train Soldiers,” said Fariss. These purposes are not mutually exclusive. I can create the necessary training for the soldier and grow several endangered species as we do it.”\n Fariss, who began his decades-long career at Fort Johnson in an environmental role before shifting to ITAM, makes clear his focus on dirt is driven by the core mission.\n “If the training ground isn’t kept together the right way, the soldiers can’t train. And if they can’t train, they’re at greater risk in real-world operations,” he said. “ I get real protective of these soldiers. I’m not the one training them, but I make sure there is a landscape that is accessible and meets the training requirements.”\n Fariss said he’s earned a reputation for being blunt in his work. He said that’s due to his passion for the mission, and a focus on getting to the right solutions to get the best outcomes.\n “You need to understand you can’t be blunt without having a vision. Most people who are direct like me have done the work, and know the circumstances,” he said. “To get away with being blunt, you have to know why you’re doing what you’re doing, believe it and be ready to defend it.”\n Part of defending his positions is understanding the role the ITAM team plays in finding the balance between effective land stewardship and endangered species protection and the training mission.\n “You can’t be a preservationist, just block everything off and leave it the way it is.  Instead, you have to be a conservationist and you must understand the single, best purpose for this dirt is to train the American Soldier. You don’t have to be loud like me to do that, but you do have to be zealous.”\n Part of effectively doing that is understanding both the training needs and the land management required to support them. For example, Fariss said if his team were asked to build a helicopter landing in a location that includes wetlands, he’d strongly share his views on how and where to do that.\n “When dealing with wetlands, you have to get a permit. Wetlands are like a filter. If you fill a filter, you need make some more filters to replace it. And have you ever seen a helicopter get stuck? It’s not pretty and it tears things up to get it out,” he said.\n So, rather than just saying “no” in this hypothetical situation, Fariss would work to find the right answer to meet the needs.\n “I’d be a fool to build that in a wetland. So, before I go to the expense of filling that wetland, I’d work with everyone involved to get to a better answer,” he said. “Part of what I get to do is to be this constant interface between the Army’s garrison side and the environmental side, who each have their own requirements.“\n Fariss points to the 42,000-acre expansion of training land at Fort Johnson, and his team’s role in converting it into excellent training grounds, as one of his proudest accomplishments in his career. Unlike Army Compatible Use Buffer projects, which support the purchase of land for conservation easements, the 42,000-acre purchase at Fort Polk was specifically for expanding training opportunities.\n “When we got the dirt, it was nowhere near ready. It had old houses, septic tanks, clear-cuts, you name it, we had it. When you buy dirt, it isn’t ready to train on. It needs a bunch of attention,” he said. “For me personally this has been a major career project. I oversaw the Environmental Impact Statement and worked on this from conception of expansion, through detailed decision processes, to the land development stage, to where it is today – useful training ground.”\n “Now that it’s useful, it’s like my baby,” he said. “I like all of Fort Johnson, but if you come visit, I’m taking you out to the new patch of dirt.”\n Fariss said his work at Fort Johnson, which began in 1998, continues to be rewarding.\n “The land is like a canvas, and you can nudge it whichever way you want it to go. There are a billion variables, but you can ultimately get it where you want it to go,” he said, adding that dating back to his youth in the cotton fields of West Texas, he’s always been attracted to land management. “When this opportunity arose, it gave me the opportunity to get my hands back in the dirt and back into managing the property. I’ve been here ever since.”","length":9350,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,8,6,7,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about Wayne Fariss and his role as the Fort Johnson Integrated Training Area Management program coordinator, detailing his career path and mission.

No prisoners were taken in the book’s content or the promotional work ahead of its release.Graham Poll, Martin Atkinson and David Elleray were all among the former colleagues Clattenburg swung for in caustic appraisals designed to settle old scores. And as for Mike Riley, his old boss at Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the body responsible for overseeing referees? “A boring f**ker,” was the succinct description.Less spiteful were the words chosen for Howard Webb, a man he had known for over two decades, but Clattenburg still made it clear this was a fractured relationship he had little wish to mend.“When Howard doesn’t need you, he doesn’t speak,” Clattenburg told The Athletic in 2021, raking up a night at Euro 2012 when Webb attended a post-match party without telling his fellow Englishman. “He’s very unique in this. Everyone sees Howard as a nice guy and he is. I would never really criticise him as a person, he’s just someone I won’t engage with in the future because I don’t need Howard Webb, the same as he doesn’t need me.”It is a quote that has not aged well.A return to the Premier League as Nottingham Forest’s refereeing analyst sees Clattenburg needing the ear of Webb, who replaced Riley as the head of PGMOL in December 2022. It is among Clattenburg’s duties to liaise with Webb, to be the conduit for a club who have felt aggrieved at decisions all season.The pair sat together at Forest’s FA Cup fifth-round defeat to Manchester United last week in seats allocated by the home club and Webb can expect regular interaction with Clattenburg.\n Howard Webb and Mark Clattenburg watch Nottingham Forest against Manchester United (Mike Egerton/PA Images via Getty Images)Last weekend’s controversial ending to Liverpool’s 1-0 win at the City Ground, where referee Paul Tierney incorrectly awarded the visiting side an uncontested drop ball, saw Clattenburg even put up for media duties by Nottingham Forest.“I haven’t spoken to the referee, I’ll leave that to the club,” he said. Yet it had not been for the want of trying. “I went to go into the referee’s dressing room (after the game) but he wouldn’t allow it.”PGMOL do not dispute that. Rules are in place that stipulate only managers and select coaching staff, listed on the official team sheets, can approach officials after a game and, even then, it is up to the referee who enters their dressing room.Clattenburg was denied an audience with Tierney and had been expecting events to play out differently. Webb had raised no objection to Clattenburg seeing referees post-match in a meeting the men held shortly after his arrival at Forest. It is not unusual for an analyst to accompany a manager into such a meeting and present video evidence but, importantly, as long as he is an accredited figure listed on the team sheet.It became the sideshow that made more headlines than Darwin Nunez’s 99th-minute winner. Forest had been on the end of another refereeing mistake, one that gave Liverpool the chance to attack at the other end (albeit almost two minutes later), and it was Clattenburg’s job to tell the world about it. Five days after the event, though, PGMOL have had no further correspondence from Clattenburg or the club that has hired him.Forest’s motivations are for this advisory role to create a positive relationship with PGMOL, the body they have addressed three letters of complaint to already this season. Clattenburg is there to create direct links of discourse, they say.Yet PGMOL maintain that all clubs already have that option open to them. Webb has made a point of being accessible to all Premier League managers and captains since taking control of the organisation 15 months ago, fielding calls and explaining the good and bad decisions his referees have reached. They might not like what he has to say, but accountability is the broad aim.“Clubs are aware that Howard Webb and his colleagues are open to calls at any point,” said Tony Scholes, the Premier League’s chief football officer, last month.Nuno Espirito Santo, Nottingham Forest’s head coach, will let Clattenburg take it from here.Clattenburg, in his own words, started his working life as a “daft electrician from Newcastle”.Long before he was made the Premier League’s youngest referee aged 29, he had run the lines as an assistant in the Northern League before the same grassroots level presented a platform for him to take centre stage. Clattenburg, with a name not easy to forget, earned a reputation as one of the brightest young officials climbing the ladder. At 25, he had reached the EFL, four years before he was plucked out by Keith Hackett to reach the highest level.Clattenburg’s ability as an elite referee was rarely in question. Along with Webb, who beat him to the Premier League by 12 months, Clattenburg was as good as it got in English football.“He was an outstanding referee,” former Premier League official Mark Halsey tells The Athletic. “He was a natural, not manufactured. His communication skills were second to none.“Mark was exceptional, like Howard was. And he was a perfectionist. We worked together and roomed together many times. He’d analyse every game and look at what he could and should’ve done differently. He’d beat himself up if he got a decision wrong.”But a divisive figure? “He didn’t suffer fools,” adds Halsey. “Mark was Mark. I wouldn’t question his character. He was as honest as the day is long. He would tell you as it was and some people didn’t like that. It’s how I would want people to be. He would never go behind someone’s back like some did when we were refereeing.”UEFA recognition followed Clattenburg’s impressive rise up the Premier League ranks, culminating at his high-water mark as an official in 2016 when he oversaw both the Champions League final and the final of Euro 2016.\n Mark Clattenburg in the 2016 Champions League final – a career highlight (Pierre-Philippe Marcou/AFP via Getty Images)That Clattenburg has tattoos to mark both showpiece occasions, though, helps paint a picture of the image-conscious figure that became so divisive during his time in the Premier League.Clattenburg was more like a footballer than a referee. He made headlines for owning a Porsche Boxster that was vandalised outside his home in Newcastle and a black BMW X5 that carried the personalised number plate C19TTS (Clatts).Poll would report Clattenburg to PGMOL bosses after turning up for one game carrying a man bag. A separate incident in 2014, when Clattenburg used his own transport to go straight from West Bromwich Albion’s home game against Crystal Palace to an Ed Sheeran concert in Newcastle, brought a reprimand as all Premier League officials are made to travel to and from games together.Then there were the hair-loss adverts that Clattenburg continues to promote. One video, posted on his Instagram account before Christmas, concluded with him spraying a product from a range positioned in front of the camera. “Hair loss is a worry and make no excuses, I do what I can to keep it,” he says.It has grown hard to know how seriously to take Clattenburg since his exit from the Premier League in 2017. In the hours that followed Forest’s galling loss to Liverpool, where he was explaining the club’s grievances to media outlets in the mixed zone, he could also be found reprimanding Viper for pinning down a contestant on the BBC show Gladiators.“This is a formal warning,” said Clattenburg, who serves as the referee on the programme, which was revived earlier this year. “I told you in the locker room, no holding.” The pivot between family entertainment and the Premier League is an awkward one.\n Mark Clattenburg in his new role on BBC’s Gladiators (BBC)As is the relationship between Clattenburg and Webb. It began in the late 1990s when they met during fitness testing at Lilleshall before, according to Webb, becoming “quite friendly” as they climbed the refereeing ladder.Webb was there to toast his colleague’s success, too. Clattenburg’s first Premier League game, a 3-1 win for Everton away to Crystal Palace in 2004, was followed by a flight back to Newcastle, where he was joined for “a night on the lash” with Webb. In his own autobiography, The Man in the Middle, Webb says Clattenburg thanked his colleague for “getting him through (that first game) unscathed”.The falling out at Euro 2012, where Clattenburg was part of Webb’s support team in Poland and Ukraine, has clearly rankled, but a call from one to the other in 2017 was hugely significant. Webb’s exit from the head of refereeing in Saudi Arabia had created a vacancy and Clattenburg, increasingly disillusioned with PGMOL, was encouraged by his former colleague to take up the opportunity. Clattenburg’s salary would be £525,000 a year tax-free, a huge climb on his basic annual Premier League wage of £100,000.It marked the start of a well-paid tour of the world. Eighteen months in Saudi Arabia were followed by spells overseeing refereeing in China, Egypt and Greece, where he became personally known to Nottingham Forest and Olympiacos owner Evangelos Marinakis in an unforgiving and hostile environment for referees. Marinakis has previously accused Greek referees of being “rigged”, while Olympiacos vice-president, Kostas Karapapas, threw a black mini-skirt at Takis Baltakos, president of the Greek football federation, last season.Clattenburg’s return to England with Forest — the first appointment of its kind in English football — has raised eyebrows throughout English football.Many Premier League clubs are sceptical of the value he will bring, instead echoing the feelings expressed by Gary O’Neil, whose Wolverhampton Wanderers side suffered from a number of high-profile errors earlier in the season.“I’m fine with our relationship with the PGMOL,” he said. “They’re always very clear and honest with me. They are always open to communicating after games. So no, I don’t feel the need for it (a Clattenburg equivalent) here.”The referees themselves are said to be nonplussed yet relaxed by Clattenburg’s appointment. Michael Salisbury will know he will be subject to one of Clattenburg’s pre-match reports handed to his Forest bosses ahead of Sunday’s game away to Brighton & Hove Albion.Webb has yet to publicly comment on Clattenburg’s return, but plenty of others have.“I’m disappointed with Nottingham Forest,” said Gary Neville. “It’s as if, ‘Look at all of this, woe is me’. I get it, some teams feel as though they’ve been hard done to, some teams feel they’ve had bad decisions against them, but to employ an ex-referee to tell you why you’re having decisions against you. For me, I think it’s a step too far.”\n Evangelos Marinakis shows his anger at the end of Forest’s defeat to Liverpool (Jon Hobley | MI News/NurPhoto via Getty Images)In the Premier League, perhaps, but across Europe it is much less unusual. Former Serie A referee Gianpaolo Calvarese was hired by Jose Mourinho, not someone traditionally sympathetic to officialdom, when in charge of Roma, while Carlos Megia Davila has been on Real Madrid’s payroll since 2009.It is also a common practice in rugby union, where head coaches recruit former officials to backroom teams. Steve Lander, formerly an international referee, was an advisor to England when they won the World Cup in 2003.“Why can’t Mark have a role at Nottingham Forest?,” asks Halsey, an ally of Clattenburg’s. “He’s been out of the Premier League for a number of years. Why can’t he be that liaison between a club and PGMOL, stopping the managers and owners from getting into trouble?“It can only help relationships. Forest have taken the initiative and employed a former referee as a consultant. Mark is ideal to do that.”Either way, just as when he was refereeing himself, Clattenburg has found himself in the eye of a storm in the Premier League. With Forest’s relegation battle only likely to become more fraught in the weeks ahead, things are unlikely to settle down quickly.(Top photo: Kieran Galvin/NurPhoto via Getty Images)","length":12130,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T05:12:16.000Z","rating":[5,4,6,4,5,5,3],"reason":"The article provides insights into the controversial career of Mark Clattenburg, detailing his relationships with other referees and his transition to roles within Nottingham Forest.

This historical drama, exploring the complex life of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the theoretical physicist at the heart of the Manhattan Project, promised from its inception to be a meticulously crafted piece of cinema. Nolan, known for his cerebral narratives and technical precision, aimed to bring the same level of scrutiny to every aspect of the film, ensuring that even the smallest details aligned perfectly with his vision for authenticity.\nAt the center of Nolan's detailed world sits Cillian Murphy, portraying J. Robert Oppenheimer, bringing a depth and intensity that has become synonymous with his performances. Murphy, an actor not unfamiliar with transformative roles, found himself once again at the intersection of personal discomfort and professional dedication. Having previously navigated the distinctive and iconic haircut for his role in Peaky Blinders, Murphy was well-prepared for the demands of embodying a historical figure under Nolan's direction. However, even he could not have anticipated the lengths to which Nolan would go to ensure every element of his appearance was historically accurate.\n Related Oppenheimer's Ending Explained - Can We Forgive J. Robert Oppenheimer? Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer follows its titular subject — before & after he created the atomic bomb. We break down the biopic's ending in detail. \n Christopher Nolan's Meticulousness Meant Cillian Murphy's Oppenheimer Haircut Took 5 Hours \nIt Was Originally Planned To Be A Minor Task Before The Flight To New Mexico\nWhen Cillian Murphy agreed to assume the role of the Christopher Nolan protagonist J. Robert Oppenheimer, he likely did not foresee his haircut becoming a focal point of production. However, Nolan's legendary attention to detail ensured that Murphy's transformation into the theoretical physicist would not be taken lightly (via Unleashing Oppenheimer: Inside Christopher Nolan's Explosive Atomic-Age Thriller). Scheduled as a minor task before the team's departure to New Mexico for shooting, Murphy's haircut evolved into a monumental five-hour session. Murphy recalled:\nI got called into Universal at 9 a.m. to do the haircut and I assumed it would be an hour, and we finished the haircut at 2 p.m. I swear, Chris supervised the cutting of every individual hair follicle on my head. There's no decision made that Chris isn't all over. Sock color, watch, hair — everything. It's amazing. That's why he is the genius that he is. But that was the longest haircut of my life.\nThis painstaking process, as detailed by hair department lead Jaime Leigh McIntosh, was emblematic of Nolan's directorial approach. McIntosh's anecdote about the session stretching into hours underscores not just a quest for visual accuracy but a broader philosophy of filmmaking where even the most minor details are afforded great significance. McIntosh noted that she believed Nolan would quietly judge the haircut every day, noting:\nThis is going to make it sound like l'm an incredibly terrible hairstylist when I tell you that Friday morning turned into a five-hour haircut. There wouldn't be a day that Chris wouldn't go over to Cillian and pat his hair down a little bit. I think Chris always thought it looked too long.\nThe legendary haircut, as producer Emma Thomas describes it, was not just about aesthetics but a testament to Nolan's commitment to authenticity. Thomas reflected that it came down to \"a game of millimeters.\"\n Related Oppenheimer Timeline - All Events In Chronological Order Christopher Nolan's movie Oppenheimer tells its story across multiple points in time in a non-linear fashion. Here is a chronological order of events. \nThe Filmmaker Is \"Allergic To Wigs\" & Didn't Want Them On Set\nThe commitment to getting Murphy's haircut just right extended beyond the chair; it influenced the film's production schedule. ChristopherNolan's desire for authenticity and aversion to wigs led him to schedule the entire Oppenheimer shoot around Murphy's haircut (via EW). Nolan explained:\n] Because I'm very allergic to wigs in movies. I really wanted the film to not have any obvious artifice when it came to the way characters presented themselves.\nThis detail, while seemingly minor, illustrates the extent of Nolan's dedication to realism in his films. Nolan's \"allergy\" to wigs reinforces his philosophy that a film's integrity lies in its attention to detail and avoidance of \"obvious artifice.\"\n Related Should Oppenheimer Have Shown Hiroshima & Nagasaki? Controversial Debate Explained & Why It Didn't Controversially, director Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer does not depict the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Could the movie have shown them? \nBefore Oppenheimer, Cillian Murphy's most iconic on-screen transformation was for his role as Tommy Shelby in Peaky Blinders. The character's signature closely shaved undercut became synonymous with the series, though Murphy himself was initially \"alarmed\" by the drastic change (via Belfast Telegraph). The actor explained:\nI was alarmed by the haircut, I have to admit, but I'm contractually obliged to have it.\nMurphy's contractual obligation to maintain the haircut throughout the show's run is a testament to the impact of visual styling in defining a character. Murphy's willingness to embrace such distinctive looks for his roles despite not being completely happy about the look speaks to his dedication to his craft, a quality that undoubtedly made him a fitting collaborator for Nolan's meticulously crafted vision of Oppenheimer.\nSources: Unleashing Oppenheimer: Inside Christopher Nolan's Explosive Atomic-Age Thriller, EW, Belfast Telegraph\n Oppenheimer Oppenheimer is a film by Christopher Nolan, which follows the theoretical physicist J.

In the wise words of Mark Twain, “Travel is fatal to prejudice, bigotry, and narrow-mindedness.”\nWhen it comes to the travel industry, however, there is still a lot of work to be done concerning diversity and gender equality. For instance, the general workforce of hotels are primarily women, a fact not reflected in stats for leadership and C-suite levels. But that’s not to say there are no trailblazers to be found. To mark International Women’s Day 2024, we speak to four inspiring female leaders in the travel industry on their love of travel and the trip that impacted them the most. \nCandice D’Cruz remembers the exact moment when she decided to jump head first into the hospitality industry. While working as a marketing and communications manager for Burj Khalifa over a decade ago, she was intrigued at the attention to detail required to open the Armani Hotel Dubai within the iconic towers. “Until then, my work had primarily focused on products and aligning them with brand ethos. I vividly recall turning to a colleague and asking, ‘Is there a specific set of qualifications needed to dive into the hospitality sector?’ \nShe soon discovered how welcoming the industry was, and her career leap took her from working in Starwood and Marriott in the Middle East to a more senior role at Hilton Asia-Pacific based out of Singapore. “Communications is a specialism flush with female leaders, but this is not true for all areas in hospitality. A personal mission of mine is to foster female leadership across the various divisions including engineering, F&B, operations and more.” Throughout her career, the mother of two has also advocated for work-life integration by emphasizing the importance of not sacrificing one aspect for the other. \nIt’s no surprise that she sees travel as an instrument of learning for her children. “For me, travel is all about human connection. Travel helps nurture global citizenship in my children by focusing on experiences over nationality. It’s a means to broaden minds, fostering an appreciation for the undiscovered; it also cultivates values such as tolerance, kindness, and inclusiveness,” she says. \nCherry blossoms with sunset. Photo by GettyImages/© copyright 2011 Sharleen Chao\nOut of the many trips she’s taken over the years, the one that sticks with her the most is a visit to Kyoto, where she savored the details and traditions that characterizes a journey to this ancient city. “While you often hear about the beauty of Japanese history and culture in movies and books, experiencing it first-hand truly takes your breath away. Whether it’s witnessing the elegance of cherry blossoms, observing the tea ceremony, or marveling at a chef’s meticulous preparation of fresh fish, every layer leaves a lasting impression.”\nFrom doing an advertising internship in New York to working in tech at Google, Joye has led a very colorful career so far. Travel has always been a big part of her work, and it’s also a personal passion for the Singapore-based Australian mother of three. “Travel is such a powerful tool, in that it facilitates transformational experiences and creates incredibly meaningful lifelong memories. It makes up a huge proportion of, as Glenn Fogel beautifully puts it, “the memories that flood your mind,” and I can certainly say that it has changed me as a person.” \nIn terms of merging travel and tech, a meeting with the CEO of Expedia Group at a summit in Silicon Valley talking about Google Ads products became what she calls a ‘career-affirming incident’ and an ‘a-ha moment’. She realized the depth of the impact that Google could have when partnering with clients, both to their businesses and to their consumers. “Even now, years later, I feel a deep sense of pride to be working in an industry that is so consistently on the cutting edge of technology and brings such meaning and fulfillment to so many people,” she says about her travel-centric role at the tech giant. \nThis year alone, Joye has already visited five different countries and describes travel as freedom. Joye says, “Without travel, life would be dull. Travel allows you to learn through doing, seeing and feeling. Travel allows you to step away from your day-to-day life, to unwind, reconnect with yourself and at times, if you want, be a totally different person!”\nJoye says that backpacking in Europe as a 20-year-old was one of her most impactful trips ever. She took every mode of transport to see the continent—trains, buses, planes and more—while also learning to be independent. “I grew up a lot. I had a much better understanding of what it meant to be self-reliant, and faith in my own ability to take care of myself.” After the trip, Joye came up with the idea for her first start up: a digital personalized gift buying service called presently.com.au.\nHaving lived in more countries you can count on one hand—namely Thailand, Canada, Belgium, France, the U.S., the U.K. and more—Mai Vejjajiva Timblick is no stranger to travel. So perhaps it makes sense that she’s in an industry that encourages people to see the world. \n“Hotels have always been part of my life. I learned what makes people feel at home and the minutiae of design details made to evoke the feeling of belonging.” Her extensive exposure to different countries and cultures has led to her move from investment banking into branding—first working at luxury home furnishings and fabrics at Jim Thompson, where she traveled to meet talented designers and architects as well as to see projects in Paris, New York, Tokyo and beyond. After 20 years at the company, she took on a chief global branding officer role at another Thai giant, Sansiri, before moving to The Standard, a hotel brand known for design-led properties that break traditions.\nAs chief creative officer, Timblick ensures that The Standard remains as distinctive and forward-thinking as they expand globally. “This means creating compelling narratives for every new hotel that shapes the guest experience, cultivating the brand’s cultural programming and looking into the burgeoning retail business,” she shares. As one of the few female C-suite leaders in the space, Timblick believes in the power of open-mindedness and celebrating the unique qualities of individuals and their personalities to help them thrive. \nNaturally, her role takes her to the four corners of the globe. She calls travel “addictive” and loves meeting new people, experiencing new smells, seeing grit and beauty wherever she goes. While she’s circled the world many times over, Timblick’s most impactful “trip” is not about the distance. “Having always been a city girl all my life and although I still spend many days in London, the “trip” of moving to live in the countryside has been one of the most transformative experiences. Here, the connection with nature, having inner peace and being present is a new but true source of inspiration. This shift of gear has been a meaningful one.” \nHospitality runs in Snaith-Lense’s blood and she knew she wanted to be in the industry from a very young age. “My late grandfather owned a men’s tailoring shop in the old Hilton Hotel in Hong Kong, and every weekend he would treat my brothers and I to our favorite breakfast of pancakes in the coffee shop, which is where we were introduced to the culture of service. My grandfather was the kindest person who took a genuine interest in people and took great care of his own people. He continues to be my inspiration daily in the way I lead our teams, and he is why I fell in love with our industry from childhood.”\nAfter graduating from the prestigious Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne, Snaith-Lense worked at Mandarin Oriental, Ritz-Carlton and Grand Hyatt, before joining Swire in 2012. After almost a decade, she eventually rose to the position of general manager in 2021. A true global citizen—she’s lived in several countries and is fluent in English, Spanish and Italian—she is the perfect leader to look after the discerning clientele of the Upper House, a hotel she stewarded to rank in Hong Kong’s top 10 of Travel+Leisure Southeast Asia’s Luxury Awards and No. 4 on World’s 50 Best Hotels. \nHer deep love of travel is something she imparts to her three children, as she sees it providing life’s most important lessons. “There are so many fascinating destinations within mere hours of Hong Kong, so my boys have had the opportunity to connect with different ways of life from a young age. I show them that it’s really the people that make a place, and encourage them to find what resonates with them. Experiencing travel through their big eyes makes every moment more special—the simple act of going to a local bakery and having an egg tart becomes an adventure!” \nOne of the most transformative trips was her honeymoon in 2016, planned by her husband Andre, which was a road trip from Los Angeles to San Francisco on the Pacific Coast Highway. “We stayed in a different city each night and got to experience quaint bed and breakfasts and little lodges along the way. One of the highlights was one of the most amazing meals I’ve ever had in my life at the Stonehouse Restaurant, set inside a 19th-century citrus packing house on the grounds of the San Ysidro Ranch.”\n Kissa Castañeda is an editor and lifestyle journalist based between Europe and Asia. Her love for travel was sparked by her father, a pilot, and to date she has called more than five cities home and travelled to 60 countries and counting.

This review is no different. In their new collections, poets Monica McClure, Rowan Ricardo Phillips, and Diane Seuss are all taking the poetic measure of America in the aftermath of the pandemic, as the whole country suffers a tremendous crisis of faith in itself. Each of them offers poetry as, if not a solution, then a kind of truth-telling companion, a mirror with a real person on both sides of it. \n The Gone Thing Monica McClure is one of my favorite contemporary poets. The Gone Thing, her follow-up to Tender Data, her mind-bending 2015 debut, is powered by the tension between seemingly contrary forces: money and poverty; the too-cool-for-you world of couture fashion and utter vulnerability; art and office life; motherhood and daughterhood. It's a book about borders — the U.S. southern border, the borders between high and low culture, between McClure's Mexican heritage and her cosmopolitan New York life, and between humor and dire seriousness. It's all rolled into one slippery sensibility, equal parts social critique and personal excavation. With arresting simplicity, McClure paraphrases the basic message the United States has for immigrants: \"It's a crime to be born poor/ It's treason to stay that way.\" This double bind is presented in countless ways throughout the poems. \"Nothing shocks me,\" writes McClure in \"Serving Many Masters,\" a poem that tallies the costs of success in a society bent on keeping the poor poor and powerless: \"Don't get up if you're not/ Ready to crawl.\" The poems also hint that a baby is on the horizon, and McClure tries to envision how to safely bring a child into such a fallen world, where \"at best, I can do an interpretation of justice/ And hope it doesn't go up in smoke.\" How can one explain post-Trump America to a child who \"will live/ Where people who are better than me/ Had their babies wrenched from their arms,/ Scattered to the winds\"? \n McClure's means of facing this entrapment is to reclaim the language, to ice it with biting humor, and to use it against itself, to defy categories, to be more than one thing at once: \"You're an earner/ as well as a mother You're a midwife to conversations.,\" she writes in the long title poem, which closes the book. We are in desperate need of those conversations — perhaps they'll start here. Modern Poetry \"The danger/ of memory is going/ to it for respite,\" writes Diana Seuss in \"Weeds,\" the best poem in her first collection following the Pulitzer-winning Frank. On page after page, she asks: How can we bear to live in the present, given what a mess it is, but also avoid living in memory, which, she says, is a trap? Seuss, too, comes to poetry as a means of survival, though, for her, even retreating into poetry risks painting things with a false glimmer: \"What luxury to think of milkweed cars/ and cookie jars and turning lights on in the dark.\" These extemporaneous poems reckon with the past, have their say, almost lightheartedly romping through meditations on whatever she feels like thinking about, often poetry and The Great Poets of the past (Gerard Manley Hopkins, Wallace Stevens, Theodore Roethke), but also the pandemic, love, and all the suffering that comes with it. In what amounts to a book-length origin story, Seuss explains how she became a poet, finding, if not beauty, then at least a sense of mission in repurposing the ugliness she encounters: \"I could find some things repulsive and still/ require them for my project. My project/ was my life.\" She takes us on a tour of \"the desolate town where I was raised,\" and where she became familiar with \"that icky-sweet smell of a dead mouse in the wall.\" Like an off-beat Virgil, she tosses off gems of odd aphoristic wisdom (\"Every town has a two-headed something\") and makes poetry more accessible by mixing in a bit of pop culture: \"Keats made such a compact corpse,/ Only five feet tall, shorter than Prince.\" Finally, she wonders whether poetry is mostly a home for misfits: \"What did modern poetry really mean? Maybe/ just fucked up.\" \n I am a late convert to the cult of Seuss, but came around forcefully to Frank and the many ways it finds to explode the sonnet form while also taking advantage of its tradition and its argumentative powers. Modern Poetry lacks the rigor of that book, as if to say it's simply foolish to try to tame all this pain. I do think the box of the sonnet did something useful for Seuss's poetry, organizing her improvisations. I miss that rigor, but maybe disorder is part of the message: \"A cobbled mind,\" she notes, \"is not fatal.\" Silver \"No one is ever alone with their thoughts,\" writes Rowan Ricardo Phillips in his fourth collection. To meet an increasingly isolating and terrifying era, Phillips retrenches in poetry, which, he claims, can be found everywhere. \"The imagination hides in plain sight.\" Poetry stands by us, ready, Phillips seems to say, to console us with the truth, whether or not we want to hear it. Only poetry, Phillips suggests, can express the horrendous illogic of our moment, which may be \"like real flowers in a field/ Of memes or a meme in a filed of real/ Flowers.\" And when it fails as a stay against confusion, poetry holds our grief, stores the unresolved: \"George Floyd's face floats slightly out of focus/.../ Remember the heat,/ how it burns the back/ Of the throat as night screams his name through the flames.\" Of course, Phillips is not saying that everyone must become a poet in order to manage the hell of 2024. Poetry is, of course, a metaphor for a more creative, nuanced form of engagement — for the conversations all three of these poets are midwifing. Craig Morgan Teicher is the author of several books, including The Trembling Answers, which won the 2018 Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize from the Academy of American Poets, and the essay collection We Begin in Gladness: How Poets Progress.","length":6173,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T13:21:00-05:00","rating":[8,7,9,7,8,8,8],"reason":"The article is rated highly for its Accuracy as it effectively presents the essence and themes of the three poetry collections discussed.

Known as the Aurat March (Women's March in Urdu), the annual protest is held in the capital, Islamabad, and cities such as Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, and Quetta. During the march, women usually highlight issues such as street harassment, bonded labor, and the lack of proper representation in parliament. In last month's elections, only 12 women were directly voted into parliament out of 266 seats. Organizers said that this year's march was dedicated to Baluch female human rights activist Mahrang Baloch, who has been protesting unlawful enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killing by the authorities in Balochistan Province.

He says Trump and his good relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin make him the better candidate to quickly end the war.\n\"The only chance of the world for a relatively fast peace deal is political change in the United States, and this is linked to who is the president,\" Orban said earlier this week.\n\"It is not gambling at all, but the only sane approach for Hungary is to bank on the return of President Donald Trump,\" he added.\nOrban, who has been in power since 2010, has called Biden's White House an adversary, according to the pro-government Magyar Nemzet daily newspaper.\nTrump has reciprocated with his admiration of Orban, whom he has called a \"strong leader,\" even though in October he referred to Orban as \"the leader of Turkey.\"\nThe activists hailed the growing defiance of the mandatory head covering in Iran as an \"achievement\" of the Women, Life, Freedom movement, which was born out of the deadly 2022 unrest that rocked the country.\nDozens of Iranian activists at home and abroad have called on the international community to boycott the Islamic republic for committing \"gender apartheid.\"\nIn a statement marking International Women's Day on March 8, more than 40 activists and groups hailed the growing defiance against the mandatory head covering in Iran as an \"achievement\" of the Women, Life, Freedom movement, which was born out of the deadly 2022 unrest that rocked the country.\nMore than 500 protesters were killed in the protests that broke out following the death of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian-Kurdish woman who died in police custody after being detained for allegedly flouting the country's hijab law. Iran's brutal crackdown on the protests has been widely condemned by rights groups.\n\"This woman-killing regime has no legitimacy in Iran, and we ask the international community to also delegitimize the regime,\" the statement from the activists says.\nIn a separate statement, jailed Nobel laureate Narges Mohammadi urged international rights groups to help the women of Iran and Afghanistan by pushing for “the criminalization of gender apartheid” committed by the Islamic republic and the Taliban-led government in Kabul through “systemic and targeted” discrimination against women.\nMohammadi, who won the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize, has been convicted five times since 2021 on various security-related charges and has been sentenced to more than 12 years in prison.\nOn March 4, London-based activist Fariba Baluch, who has been advocating for the rights of women and the Baluch ethnic minority in Iran, was awarded the U.S. State Department’s International Women of Courage Award.\n\"This award is not mine, but for all the nameless, courageous girls and women in Iran who are fighting for their basic demands,\" she told RFE/RL’s Radio Farda.\nThe United Nations' Independent International Fact-Finding Mission asserted in a report on March 8 that Iran's repression of the 2022 protests and \"pervasive institutional discrimination against women\" had led to serious human rights violations, \"many amounting to crimes against humanity.\"\nThe fact-finding mission concluded that unless the Iranian establishment implements fundamental changes, member states of the UN Human Rights Council \"should explore avenues for accountability at international level and in their domestic systems.\"\nThe Islamic republic has long been dismissive of concerns by Western states and rights groups about women's rights in Iran.\n\"The issue of women is a point of strength in Islam,\" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in an address to a group of women in December 2023. \"It should not be thought that we are supposed to be held accountable on the issue of women.\"\nBalkars In Russia's North Caucasus Mark 80th Anniversary Of Deportation To Central Asia\nThe head of Kabardino-Balkaria issued a statement expressing compassion for the relatives of the victims \"of arbitrariness and lawlessness.\"\nBalkars in Russia's North Caucasus region of Kabardino-Balkaria are marking the 80th anniversary of their mass deportation to Central Asia by Josef Stalin's government. The head of Kabardino-Balkaria, Kazbek Kokov, issued a statement expressing compassion for the relatives of the victims \"of arbitrariness and lawlessness.\" About 38,000 Balkars were deported on March 8, 1944, to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan by the Soviet regime, which accused them of collaborating with Nazi Germany. Those who survived were able to return to the North Caucasus in 1957.

For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here. \nUkraine's peace formula calls for the withdrawal of all Russian troops from Ukraine, restoring the country's 1991 post-Soviet borders and holding Russia accountable for its actions. The Kremlin has previously balked at such conditions.\n\"Special attention during the visit will also be given to joint projects in the defense-industrial sphere,\" Ukraine's presidency said in a statement on Telegram, adding that Zelenskiy will visit the shipyards where corvettes for the Ukrainian Navy are under construction and will meet with representatives of Turkish defense companies.\nThe Turkish presidency said the talks will include \"a detailed discussion of the course of the Ukraine-Russia war, the recent situation of contacts regarding the continuation of the [Black Sea] Grain Corridor Agreement, and the efforts for lasting peace in the region.\"\nNATO member Turkey has maintained good relations with both its Black Sea neighbors and together with the United Nations brokered a deal that had allowed Kyiv to safely export grain from its ports. But in July 2023 Russia left the agreement, known as the Black Sea Initiative, arguing that its own food and fertilizer exports were not enjoying the same conditions.\nTurkey has sought to convince Moscow to return to the deal, but so far Russia has refused.\nZelenskiy and Erdogan are due to meet at the Dolmabahce Palace in Istanbul. The two leaders are due to hold a joint press conference scheduled for 7 p.m. local time.\nZelenskiy last visited Turkey in July, when he held lengthy talks with Erdogan.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine repelled a fresh wave of Russian drone attacks on March 8.\nAir defenses shot down 33 out of the 37 drones launched by Russia at five of its regions, the military said in a statement on March 8.\nIn Mixed Message On International Women's Day, Putin Says Motherhood Is Women's 'Preordination'\nPresident Vladimir Putin sent a mixed message to Russia's women to mark International Women's Day, lauding their contribution in the war against Ukraine while emphasizing that the most important duty for women is the \"relentless care of children.\"\nIn a message to mark the holiday on March 8, Putin said he signed a decree on granting clemency to 52 women imprisoned for various crimes, most of whom had underage children, were pregnant, or whose relatives are taking part in the war in Ukraine. The Defense Ministry estimates some 30,000 women are involved in the armed forces.\nWhile he paid special tribute to the women who are \"performing combat tasks\" in Ukraine, Putin, who has made family values a major element of his campaign for reelection in a March 15-17 vote, said in a video statement that having children is women's \"preordination.\"\n\"You, dear women, are capable of changing the world with your beauty, wisdom, and generosity of spirit, but mostly thanks to your greatest gift the nature gave you -- giving birth to children. Motherhood is an amazing preordination of women,\" Putin said in the video statement.\nRussian officials have focused on the demographic situation for years, with the birthrate falling since 2014 -- it currently sits at its lowest level since 1999 -- often raising the decrease at government sessions and during parliamentary debate. Many lawmakers have tried to initiate laws restricting abortions and access to contraceptives to spur population growth.\nMeanwhile, groups of wives of mobilized soldiers have staged protests outside the Kremlin in recent weeks to call for the return of their husbands from the front lines.\nAlso on March 8, police in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg disrupted a rally planned by feminist organizations in a park designated for public gatherings, known locally as Hyde Park.\nUp to 100 persons have a right to hold pickets and rallies in such places without preliminary authorization from local authorities as long as they inform them beforehand.\nShortly before the beginning of the rally, police sealed off the park, saying a \"suspicious item\" was discovered on the grounds.\nThe activists said they will continue to stand \"against women's political rightlessness, domestic violence, forced reproduction, and prostitution.\"\nPutin did not mention domestic violence in his message, which feminist groups in Russia say accounted for 61 percent of all women killed in 2018.\nBills to prevent domestic violence have been proposed in parliament’s lower chamber, the State Duma, more than 40 times in recent years, but none of them were approved.\nIn 2017, battering was decriminalized in Russia and domestic violence became an administrative offense that envisions fines and days in jail as a punishment.\nThe Kremlin's tight grip on politics, media, law enforcement, and other levers means Putin, who has ruled Russia as president or prime minister since 1999, appears certain to win the election barring a very big, unexpected development.\nA missile fired from Russia's Belgorod region is seen from the northeastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.\nUkrainian air defenses shot down 33 out of the 37 drones launched by Russia at five of its regions, the military said early on March 8. \"As a result of defense work, 33 [drones] were shot down above the Odesa, Kirovohrad, Kherson, Mykolayiv, and Kharkiv regions,\" the Ukrainian Air Force reported. Russia also fired one S-300 antiaircraft missile and two Kh-59 missiles, the military said. Meanwhile, shelling wounded five people, including a 3-year-old child, in Chuguyev, in Kharkiv region, governor Oleh Synyehubov wrote on Telegram.

Korbein Schultz, who is also an intelligence analyst, was accused in a six-count indictment of charges including conspiring to obtain and disclose military defense information and bribery of an unidentified public official. The indictment outlines that Schultz was initially asked to provide documents detailing lessons that could be learned from Russia's war with Ukraine and how those lessons could be applied to the U.S. helping Taiwan in the event of an attack.\nIt affects conscripts whose military service was due to end before February 24, 2022, but was prolonged due to Russia's invasion. (file photo)\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskiy issued a decree on March 7 providing for prewar conscripts still serving in the two-year-old war against Russia to be discharged into Ukraine's reserves within the next two months. The decree will allow some respite for service members who have been engaged in the military since even before Russian troops poured over the border in February 2022. In addition, those discharged will be exempt from further call-ups for 12 months. It affects conscripts whose military service was due to end before February 24, 2022, but was prolonged due to Russia's invasion.\nBiden Rips Trump In High-Stakes Speech, Says Won't 'Bow Down' To Putin\nWASHINGTON -- In a high-profile televised address, U.S. President Joe Biden ripped his likely Republican challenger Donald Trump for \"bowing down\" to Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged Congress to pass aid for Ukraine, warning that democracy around the world was under threat.\nIn the annual State of the Union address, Biden came out swinging from the get-go against Putin and Trump -- whom he called \"my predecessor\" without mentioning him by name -- and on behalf of Ukraine, as he sought to win over undecided voters ahead of November’s election.\nThe March 7 address to a joint session of Congress this year carried greater significance for the 81-year-old Biden as he faces a tough reelection in November, mostly likely against Trump. The president, who is dogged by questions about his physical and mental fitness for the job, showed a more feisty side during his hourlong speech, drawing a sharp contrast between himself and Trump on a host of key foreign and domestic issues.\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here. \nBiden denounced Trump for recent remarks about NATO, the U.S.-led defense alliance that will mark its 75th anniversary this year, and compared him unfavorably to former Republican President Ronald Reagan.\n\"Bowing down to a Russian leader, it is outrageous, dangerous, and unacceptable,\" Biden said, referring to Trump, as he recalled how Reagan -- who is fondly remembered by older Republicans -- stood up to the Kremlin during the Cold War.\nAt a campaign rally last month, Trump said that while serving in office he warned a NATO ally he \"would encourage\" Russia \"to do whatever the hell they want\" to alliance members who are \"delinquent\" in meeting defense-spending goals.\nThe remark raised fears that Trump could try to pull the United States out of NATO should he win the election in November.\nBiden described NATO as \"stronger than ever\" as he recognized Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson in the audience. Earlier in the day, Sweden officially became the 32nd member of NATO, ending 200 years of nonalignment. Sweden applied to join the defense alliance after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Finland became a NATO member last year.\nBiden called on Congress to pass a Ukraine aid bill to help the country fend off a two-year-old Russian invasion. He warned that should Russia win, Putin will not stop at Ukraine's border with NATO.\nA group of right-wing Republicans in the House of Representatives have for months been holding up a bill that would allocate some $60 billion in critical military, economic, and humanitarian aid to Ukraine as it defends its territory from Russian invaders.\nThe gridlock in Washington has starved Ukrainian forces of U.S. ammunition and weapons, allowing Russia to regain the initiative in the war. Russia last month seized the eastern city of Avdiyivka, its first victory in more than a year.\n\"Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons it needs to defend itself,\" Biden said.\n\"My message to President Putin...is simple. We will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down,\" Biden said.\nTrump, who has expressed admiration for Putin, has questioned U.S. aid to Ukraine, though he recently supported the idea of loans to the country.\nBiden also criticized Trump for the former president's attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election, saying those efforts had posed a grave threat to democracy at home.\n\"You can't love your country only when you win,\" he said, referring not just to Trump but Republicans in Congress who back the former president's claim that the 2020 election was rigged.\nBiden \"really strove to distinguish his policies from those of Donald Trump,\" said Kathryn Stoner, a political-science professor at Stanford University and director of its Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law.\nBy referencing Reagan, Biden was seeking \"to appeal to moderate Republicans and independents to remind them that this is what your party was -- standing up to Russia,\" she told RFE/RL.\nThe State of the Union address may be the biggest opportunity Biden has to reach American voters before the election. More than 27 million people watched Biden’s speech last year, equivalent to about 17 percent of eligible voters.\nBiden's address this year carries greater importance as he faces reelection in November, most likely against Trump. The speech may be the biggest opportunity he has to reach American voters before the election.\nTrump won 14 of 15 primary races on March 5, all but wrapping up the Republican nomination for president. Biden beat Trump in 2020 but faces a tough reelection bid amid low ratings.\nA Pew Research poll published in January showed that just 33 percent of Americans approve of Biden's job performance, while 65 percent disapprove. Biden's job-approval rating has remained below 40 percent over the past two years as Americans feel the pinch of high inflation and interest rates.\nBiden, the oldest U.S. president in history, has been dogged by worries over his age. Two thirds of voters say he is too old to effectively serve another term, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll.\nLast month, a special counsel report raised questions about his memory, intensifying concerns over his mental capacity to run the country for four more years.\nAs a result, Biden's physical performance during the address was under close watch. Biden was animated during the speech and avoided any major gaffes.\n\"I thought he sounded really strong, very determined and very clear,\" Stoner said.\nInstead of avoiding the subject of his age, Biden took it head on, saying the issue facing our nation \"isn’t how old we are, it’s how old our ideas are.\" \nHe warned Trump was trying to take the country back to a darker period.\n\"Some other people my age see a different story: an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution,\" Biden said, referring to the 77-year-old Trump.\nZelenskiy Hails Sweden's NATO Entry, Eyes Day Ukraine Might Also Join\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy (left) meets Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson at his country retreat in Harpsund, Sweden, in August 2023.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hailed Sweden's entry into the NATO military alliance, largely viewed as a reaction to Russia's invasion of his country in 2022, saying the Scandinavian country was a \"strong ally and a country that can be trusted.\"\nZelenskiy, who seeks eventual NATO membership for Ukraine, added that \"there will be a day when Sweden will be able to congratulate Ukraine on joining the alliance as well. Together, we are always stronger.\"\nSweden joined NATO in Washington on March 7, two years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine forced it to rethink its national security policy and conclude that support for the alliance was the nation's best safety guarantee.\nPrime Minister Ulf Kristersson handed over final documentation to the U.S. government, the last step in a long process to secure the backing of all members to join the alliance.\n\"Good things come to those who wait,\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said.\n\"Today is a truly historic day,\" Kristersson said. \"Sweden is now a member of NATO. We will defend freedom together with the countries closest to us -- both in terms of geography, culture and values.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy (left) presents General Valeriy Zaluzhniy with a medal in Kyiv on February 8.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appointed Valeriy Zaluzhniy to be Kyiv's ambassador to the United Kingdom, about a month after the general was removed from his position as commander in chief of the military. The 50-year-old Zaluzhniy's removal from his military post was part of Zelenskiy's announced \"reboot\" of Ukraine's government and military, his most consequential shake-up since Russia's February 2022 invasion.

Prominent psychiatry boards in Iran have called the practice an abuse of judicial authority.\nYasin recently made a plea from prison to the judiciary to \"issue my death sentence\" rather than continue holding him indefinitely without a trial. He has been detained without trial for 18 months, with multiple court dates set and then subsequently delayed.\nInitial reports suggest Yasin was first taken to a local police station during nationwide protests in September 2022 before being transferred to Evin prison and subsequently to the Greater Tehran prison.\nThe judiciary's news agency has reported that Yasin was accused of \"waging war against God,\" a charge that led to a death sentence from the Tehran Revolutionary Court. However, the Supreme Court accepted Yasin's appeal for a retrial and referred his case back to the Revolutionary Court. A retrial has yet to take place.\nYasin has described enduring a \"mock execution\" set up by prison officials before being moved to prison in Karaj.\nHe has consistently maintained his innocence, releasing multiple audio recordings to publicize his claims. He has also reportedly launched at least one hunger strike in protest.\nIt's not Yasin's first transfer to Aminabad, where he previously reported adverse reactions to an unidentified medication, raising serious health concerns. The incident mirrors the case of Behnam Mahjoubi, a Gonabadi Dervish activist who died in 2021 following similar transfers and medical neglect.\nHuman rights lawyer Saeed Dehghan has criticized the use of psychiatric facilities like Aminabad for political prisoners, indicating a punitive approach by the judiciary and prison authorities.\nSince the September 2022 death of Mahsa Amini in custody after she was detained for allegedly wearing a head scarf improperly, Iranians have taken to the streets across the country to protest a lack of rights, with women and schoolgirls making unprecedented shows of support in the biggest threat to the Islamic government since the 1979 revolution.\nThe judiciary, at the urging of lawmakers, has instituted harsh penalties, including the death sentence, for offenders.\nWritten by Ardeshir Tayebi based on an original story in Persian by RFE/RL's Radio Farda\nAfghan Woman Award Winner Determined To Struggle For Rights Under Taliban\nU.S. first lady Jill Biden (left) and Secretary of State Antony Blinken (right) present an International Women of Courage award to Benafsha Yaqoobi during an awards ceremony on March 4 at the White House in Washington.\nAfghan lawyer Benafsha Yaqoobi has been chosen as one of the winners of the U.S. State Department's 2024 International Women of Courage Award.\nYaqoobi, who is visually impaired, has advocated for human and women's rights from exile since Taliban militants seized power and forced her to flee Afghanistan in August 2021.\n\"I am happy to have this prize because it gives me another platform to raise my voice for the world's most marginalized community,\" she told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi while alluding to the plight of Afghan women under Taliban rule.\nWhile just about every part of Afghan society has seen an erosion of fundamental freedoms and rights under the militants, women and girls have been the main targets of mounting Taliban bans and restrictions.\nHard-line Taliban leaders have used their interpretation of Islamic Shari'a law to justify banning teenage Afghan girls and women from education, work in most sectors, and draconian restrictions on their mobility and how they can appear in public.\nThe Taliban has banned women from recreation by outlawing their visits to parks and public baths.\nWomen's rights activists who have spoken out, have ended up in jail.\n\"Every day after the Taliban takeover in August 2021, we are witnessing new restrictions being imposed on Afghan women,\" Yaqoobi said.\n\"No one in the world today can beat the oppression that the women suffer in Afghanistan,\" she added.\nThe rights campaigner served as a commissioner for the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission before the Taliban's return to power.\nYaqoobi advocated disability rights by hosting a daily television show.

The European Commission has proposed that the suspension of duties and quotas should continue until June 2025, which the European Parliament's Trade Committee approved by 26 for to 10 against, with one abstention. In response to EU farmer protests, the proposal also introduces an \"emergency brake\" for poultry, eggs, and sugar, meaning tariffs would be allowed if imports exceed the average levels of 2022 and 2023.\nCzech President Petr Pavel (left) welcomes French President Emmanuel Macron at Prague Castle in Prague on March 5.\nFinancing for the purchase of 800,000 rounds of ammunition for Ukraine has been secured, Czech media quoted Czech President Petr Pavel as saying on March 7. CTK said 18 countries had joined the Czech-led initiative. Norway said earlier on March 7 it would donate up to 1.6 billion Norwegian crowns ($153 million) for the plan. That followed pledges by Germany and France this week. Pavel flagged the plan to source ammunition for Ukraine from third countries last month, saying the Czech Republic had found 500,000 rounds of 155-mm ammunition and 300,000 rounds of 122-mm that could be delivered in weeks if funding was secured.\nBAKU -- A court in Baku has extended the pretrial detention of two independent journalists arrested last year on smuggling charges they and their supporters vehemently reject.\nThe Xatai district court ruled on March 7 that Elnara Qasimova and Hafiz Babali must stay in pretrial detention until at least June 13. The journalists' lawyers called the court's ruling baseless and vowed to appeal it.\nQasimova, a correspondent for the Abzas Media investigative website, was arrested in January. Babali, the chief of the economic news department at the Turan news agency, was arrested in December.\nInvestigators say the arrests were part of a probe against four other journalists and editors of Abzas Media -- Ulvi Hasanli, Sevinc Vaqifqizi, Mahammad Kekalov, and Nargiz Absalamova -- who were arrested in November last year after police claimed they found 40,000 euros ($43,500) in cash in the offices of the media outlet.\nThe journalists were charged with illegally smuggling foreign currency. They insist the case against them is trumped-up and in retaliation for their reports about official corruption.\nOn March 6, Baku police detained about a dozen journalists from the Toplum TV online television channel after searching its offices in the Azerbaijani capital. The majority of the journalists were released hours later. However, three journalists -- Musfiq Cabbar, Elmir Abbasov, and Farid Ismayilov -- were not released and charged with smuggling.\nAlso on March 6, police detained a founding member of the Third Republican Platform opposition group -- Akif Qurbanov.\nToplum TV's editor in chief is Khadija Ismayilova, a former bureau chief in Baku for RFE/RL's Radio Azadliq and one of the country's most renowned investigative journalists.\nIsmayilova told journalists that her media outlet \"has not been involved in any illegal activities,\" stressing that the authorities most likely \"want to fully liquidate independent media in the country to leave no platform for critical opinions.\"\nWestern governments and international human rights groups have urged Azerbaijani authorities to drop all charges against the journalists and release them.\nOn March 7, British Ambassador to Azerbaijan Fergus Auld expressed concerns about the March 6 arrests.\n\"Britain is deeply troubled by the arrest of journalists from 'Toplum TV' and the representative of the '3rd Republic' political movement. We call on Azerbaijan to protect freedom of expression and the fundamental human rights, including those of all recently arrested media representatives,\" Auld said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter.\nCritics of Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's government say authorities in the oil-rich Caspian Sea state frequently seek to silence dissent by jailing opposition activists, journalists, and civil-society advocates on trumped-up charges.\nAliyev has ruled Azerbaijan with an iron fist since 2003, taking over from his father, Heydar Aliyev, who served as president for a decade.\nThe commission at the time said Ilze Liepa, who received Lithuanian citizenship in 2000, openly supported Russia and its policies, including its invasion of Ukraine.\nMoscow-born ballet dancer Ilze Liepa and Russian businessman Yury Kudimov have lost their Lithuanian citizenship after being identified by the Baltic country as persons that \"pose a threat to Lithuania's national security,\" the Lithuanian news site Delfi reported. Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda signed a decree annulling their citizenship on March 7. The Commission of Citizenship Issues recommended the move last month. The commission at the time said Liepa, who received Lithuanian citizenship in 2000, openly supported Russia and its policies, including its invasion of Ukraine. Kudimov, a former KGB officer who received Lithuanian citizenship in 1997, continues to have links with top Russian officials, the commission said.

In remarks at the start of a meeting with German Economy Minister Robert Habeck in Washington, Yellen urged House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson again to swiftly pass a $61 billion military and economic aid package for Ukraine.\nBaha'is Say Iranian Security Forces Destroyed 30 Graves At Tehran Cemetery\nThe actions of the Islamic republic's authorities not only inflicted severe and fresh pain on these families, but also underscored the \"inhumanity of their conduct\" toward believers, a Baha'i spokeswoman said.\nOfficials from Iran's Baha'i community say Iranian security forces have destroyed more than 30 graves at the Golestan Javid, a cemetery dedicated to Baha'is in Tehran, in what they characterized as an attempt to erase the existence of the deceased because of their religious beliefs.\nAccording to a statement from the Baha'i International Community group, the targeted graves were located in the Khavaran mass grave site and the demolition was done with the aim of completely obscuring the presence of the burial sites.\nSimin Fahandej, the spokeswoman for the Worldwide Baha’i Community in Geneva, said the actions of the Islamic republic's authorities not only inflicted severe and fresh pain on these families, but also underscored the \"inhumanity of their conduct\" toward believers.\nSince the Islamic Republic of Iran was established in 1979, hundreds of Baha'is have been arrested and jailed for their beliefs. At least 200 have been executed or were arrested and never heard from again.\nThousands more have been banned from receiving higher education or had their property confiscated, while Baha'i cemeteries are often desecrated in what Baha'is say is the systematic targeting of the group.\nThe Khavaran cemetery in the east of the capital was traditionally a final resting place for members of religious minorities who were interred there to keep them separate from the graves of Muslims.\nBut decades of forced disappearances and secret extrajudicial executions have made Khavaran best-known as a secret burial ground for some of the thousands killed.\nThe graves at Khavaran are unmarked, and Tehran has for decades barred families of the dead from mourning there and punished those who left flowers and mementos.\nIn April 2023, Baha'i believers Shadi Shahidzadeh, Mansour Amini, Vahid Qadamian, and Ataollah Zafar were arrested in connection with activities related to the cemetery. Three months later, Tehran's Revolutionary Court sentenced each to five years in prison.\nIran accuses Baha'is of having links to Israel, where the city of Haifa hosts a center of the Baha'i faith. Baha'i leaders reject the allegations and say they are used as a pretext to persecute members.\nThere are some 300,000 Baha'i adherents in Iran and an estimated 5 million worldwide.\nIn Iran, where their faith is not officially recognized in the constitution, its leaders say they face systematic persecution.\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has on several occasions called the Baha'i faith a cult and, in a religious fatwa issued in 2018, he forbade contact, including business dealings, with followers of the faith.\nWritten by Ardeshir Tayebi based on an original story in Persian by RFE/RL's Radio Farda\nU.S. Ambassador to Russia Lynne Tracy leaves the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow in April 2023.\nRussia's Foreign Ministry summoned U.S. Ambassador to Moscow Lynne Tracy and delivered a stern warning for Washington to stay out of Russia's internal affairs ahead of a presidential election widely expected to hand incumbent Vladimir Putin another term in office given the absence of opposition candidates on the ballot.\nThe ministry informed Tracy on March 7 that three U.S. nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) -- American Councils for International Education, Cultural Perspectives, and the Institute of International Education -- had been labeled \"undesirable organizations\" and demanded the embassy \"stop any collaboration\" with them.\nThe ministry accused the NGOs of running \"anti-Russian programs and projects aimed at recruiting 'agents of influence' under the guise of educational and cultural exchanges\" and any further cooperation with the embassy \"would be considered a violation of Russian law.\"\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow blasted the Russian move, saying in a statement that it \"marks a new low in the Russian government's crackdown on long-standing and entirely routine people-to-people programs.\"\n\"The idea that it would be 'undesirable' to connect Russians and Americans on a human level and facilitate travel for professional and educational development is a tragic illustration of the Kremlin's desire to isolate its own people, depriving them of the chance to network, expand their horizons, and contribute to building a more prosperous and peaceful world,\" it added.\nRussian officials often show disdain for Western-backed NGOs and civil society groups, accusing them of trying to manipulate Russian public opinion in order to stir up popular discontent and advance the foreign policy interests of their home countries. Western governments routinely reject the claims.\n\"It is especially emphasized that attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of the Russian Federation, including subversive actions and the spread of disinformation in the context of elections and a special military operation, will be harshly and decisively suppressed, up to and including the expulsion as 'persona non grata' of U.S. Embassy employees involved in such actions,\" the ministry said in a statement.\nAll three NGOs labelled say they conduct activities to strengthen international ties through academic, professional, and cultural exchanges and programs and that thousands of students have used the programs to further their education.\nThe activities of the three organizations will be prohibited in Russia, and anyone who cooperates with them may face criminal penalties, including up to six years in prison.\nThe \"undesirable organization\" law, adopted in 2015, was a Kremlin-backed regulation on NGOs that receive funding from foreign sources. The label has been applied to dozens of foreign groups since Moscow began using the classification and effectively bans an organization outright.\nThe ministry's move comes just over a week before Russians head to the polls in a presidential election the Kremlin hopes to use as a show of national unity in support of Putin and his invasion of Ukraine, which Russia refers to as a \"special military operation.\"\nRussian elections are tightly controlled by the Kremlin and are neither free nor fair but are viewed by the government as necessary to convey a sense of legitimacy.\nThe Kremlin's tight grip on politics, media, law enforcement, and other levers means Putin, who has ruled Russia as president or prime minister since 1999, is certain to win, barring a very big, unexpected development.\nViolence Rocks Poland As Farmers Protest Ukraine Food Imports And 'Green Deal' Regulations\nFarmers in Warsaw protest on March 6 against EU \"Green Deal\" measures, and duty-free imports of Ukrainian food to Poland. \nPolice deployed pepper spray and flash grenades on protesters in Warsaw opposing EU regulations aimed at combating climate change, coupled with imports of cheap food from Ukraine.","length":48030,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07 19:12:00Z","rating":[3,5,5,7,7,7,7],"reason":"Armenia Says Maintaining Regular Contact With Ankara, Erdogan: The article provides factual information about the communication between Armenia and Turkey, as well as the diplomatic efforts being made to normalize relations.

It is key stop in the pre-draft process as their performances inevitably shake up the draft boards.\nWith that in mind, here's a look at the latest projections for the Giants, who hold the sixth overall pick: \nAnalysis: \"I wouldn't rule out the Giants trying to move up for a quarterback, but in this scenario, Daniels falls into their lap.\"\nAnalysis: \"They have too many Nos. 2 and 3 receivers. Odunze, who caught 92 passes for 1,640 yards and 13 touchdowns last season, could be their No. 1 guy.\"\nAnalysis: \"General manager Joe Schoen won't be able to hide his smile if Nabers is still available at No. 6. Regardless of who's playing quarterback for the Giants, this offense drastically needs a true X receiver who changes how defenses game plan against it. Nabers is that, and more.\"\nAnalysis: \"The Giants can land the most explosive player in the draft with Nabers, the former LSU star who plays at a warp speed that no defender can match. This would provide a huge boost to a Giants offense that had the second-fewest passing yards in the NFL last season and just 44 passing plays of 20-plus yards (better than just six other teams in the league). Nabers is a massive play waiting to happen, both with his vertical speed to stretch the field on deep shots and with his run-after-catch ability. He averaged 120.7 yards per game last season and caught 14 TDs.\"\nAnalysis: \"At 6-foot-3 and 215 pounds, Odunze is a physical and aggressive player before and after the catch. He's a dominant option on both back-shoulder fades and breaking routes. No matter who is throwing the ball, Odunze would immediately boost the Giants' offense.\"\nAnalysis: \"He is sure-handed and can beat coverage in multiple ways. His aggressive \"my ball\" mentality helped him tie for the most contested catches (24) in the FBS last season, routinely hauling in passes in tight coverage.\"\nAnalysis: \"The Giants must surround Daniel Jones with more playmakers in order for the well-compensated quarterback to thrive in a make-or-break year.\"\nAnalysis: \"In a slight surprise, the Giants grab McCarthy to eventually start over again at QB. He might very well sit behind Daniel Jones in 2024 before getting the ball in 2025.\" \nAnalysis: \"Alt (6-7, 322) will be OT1 on some boards after a fantastic junior season with the Irish. He still moves like the 220-pound tight end he was in high school.\"\nAnalysis: \"Odunze rounds out a three-quarterback, three-receiver start to this mock draft, giving the Giants a potential true No. 1 wide receiver. Odunze dropped just 3.2% of the catchable passes thrown his way this past season, while his 2.93 yards per route run average ranked eighth among his classmates.\"\nAnalysis: \"Alt played only left tackle for Notre Dame but is a very natural athlete who possesses the coordination to play on the other side.\"\nAnalysis: \"Offensive line could be a consideration here, but the Giants opt for Nabers, a big-play receiver who is a threat to take it to the house every time he touches the ball.\"\nAnalysis: \"Malik Nabers adds much-needed explosiveness, reliability and big-play ability for a group that has lacked all of those traits from a wide receiver in some time.\"\nAnalysis: \"The Giants find themselves in the best position possible as they were able to stay patient, didn't give up any draft capital to move up, and drafted their quarterback of the future in Jayden Daniels. Daniels is a true dual-threat quarterback that I believe Brian Daboll will be able to develop and be creative with his play-calling, finally making this Giants offense an exciting one to watch.\"\nAnalysis: \"[Whoever] is under center would have two of the most athletic specimens at the tight end position and they can share the field along with Brian Daboll's play-calling.\"\nAnalysis: \"Daniels' electric running ability and vertical passing is a great fit with Daboll, who unlocked both of those aspects while working with Josh Allen a few years ago in Buffalo.\"\nAnalysis: \"I can't see Joe Schoen leaving this first round without a quarterback. McCarthy has sky-high upside.\"\nAnalysis: \"Upgrading the offense has to be a priority this offseason.\"\nAnalysis: \"Jayden Daniels is an electric dual-threat talent with the processing ability to dissect defenses at multiple levels and the linear speed to outrun NFL secondary defenders.\"\nAnalysis: \"We're already seeing Marvin Harrison Jr.'s draft stock drop a little bit with more people supporting guys like Rome Odunze and Keon Coleman, but New York's fine with that. Whether you think Harrison is the best receiver or not, one thing's for sure: the kid can ball.\"\nAnalysis: \"The speedy Malik Nabers would be a great addition to an offense that is in major need of playmakers.\"\nAnalysis: \"Nabers' raw speed is still an understated part of his game, but don't be surprised to see a 40 time around 4.40 seconds or faster.\"\nAnalysis: \"Yes, despite his relatively low usage in the passing game at Ann Arbor – where he was surrounded by a tremendous supporting cast on both sides of the ball – his stock seems to continue skyrocketing. Why? Demeanor, accuracy, leadership, athleticism, high ceiling, good decision-making. And he's a winner (27-1 record with the Wolverines).\"\nAnalysis: \"He played through injuries in 2023 and still flashed dominance. Even with Darren Waller on the roster, Bowers makes so much sense in New York.\"\nAnalysis: \"Odunze is my WR2 by the slimmest of margins. In fact, his contested-catch ability, as well as his body control, ranks in the top 20 percentile in a 10-season sample. I also cannot believe my models didn't choose an O-lineman here either, as it is an area of big need. That should tell you how much my evaluations love Odunze.\"\nAnalysis: \"Nabers doesn't have the route tree of Marvin Harrison or Rome Odunze, but he's lightning-fast, has excellent hands, and is just as effective on the outside as in the slot.\"\nAnalysis: \"Will Anderson Jr.'s production dropped in his final year at Alabama (34.5 tackles for loss, 17.5 sacks to 17 and 10) but he proved his combination of power and speed was NFL-ready. I expect to see the same from Verse, who was no less of a problem for offensive lines in 2023 than he was in the previous season, even if his numbers were slightly less impressive in '23 (17 TFL, 9 sacks in '22; 12.5 and 9 in '23).\"\nAnalysis: \"If the Giants are going to run it back with Daniel Jones, they might as well give him a true No. 1 wide receiver for the first time in his career. Nabers has the talent to give the G-Men an element they have missed since Odell Beckham Jr.'s heyday.\"\nAnalysis: \"In nearly any other draft class, Malik Nabers would be the first receiver drafted and a lock to be a top-five pick. But because of Harrison Jr., he \"slides\" to No. 6. It's very reminiscent of when Julio Jones fell to No. 6 in the 2011 NFL Draft because A.J. Green was selected at No. 4 by the Bengals.\"\nAnalysis: \"The Giants could easily go and get Malik Nabers and add a true playmaking WR here to help Daniel Jones on the outside. Instead, they take OT2 and add more help in the trenches. You can't throw the ball if you can't protect, and the Giants understand that with the selection of Olu Fashanu in this 2024 NFL Mock Draft.\"","length":8599,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T19:03:00Z","rating":[7,9,8,7,8,8],"reason":"- The article provides a detailed analysis and projections for the New York Giants' draft options, focusing on potential picks and their impact on the team.

The cans were printed by East Coast Printing.\nBridge Road Brewers says that by integrating dynamic QR codes on its can, cases, bar menus, t-shirts, posters and more, it has transformed its physical, owned assets into a digital media channel for immersive digital experiences, “directly engaging consumers, and fostering a deeper connection with the brand.”\nNathan Fenton, marketing manager at Bridge Road Brewers, said, “Prior to Covid only 17 per cent of the population knew what a QR code was. Now everyone knows what they are and how to use them.\n“They are an excellent way of connecting with our customers, especially when they are having a beer, we have created an interactive engaging experience for them, through the QR code and their mobile phone.”\nThe campaign was conceptualised by Bridge Road Brewers, which partnered with consumer engagement platform Cellr to introduce the concept of \"connected experiences\" to the Australian craft beer sector.\nHead of Growth at Cellr, Daniel Hill, said, “Using Cellr's platform, we delivered an engaging and fun experience for Bridge Road's customers.\n“We were then able to leverage real-time data, enhancing the user journey, encouraging deeper engagement with the campaign, and effectively increasing click-through rates.”\nHill says Cellr enhanced the user journey, encouraged deeper engagement with the campaign, and effectively increased click-through rates to the GABS voting page. This iterative process of monitoring, analysing, and refining early in the campaign was crucial for maximising campaign effectiveness.\n“Beechworth Pale Ale’s top five position in the GABS Hottest 100 Craft Beers has been the best gift we could have received for the 18th year of brewing our flagship beer. We wanted to deliver something special for this campaign, partnering with Cellr allowed us to engage customers in a fun and creative way as they consume the product both in-venue and at home,” said Fenton.\n“The professionalism of the Cellr team and platform allowed us to deliver an experience that captured the imagination of our consumers, helping deliver the equal-best result we’ve ever had in the history of the Hottest 100 Count.”\nThis achievement celebrates the second time Bridge Road Brewers have secured a top-five result in the countdown and the 16th time it's featured in the top 100, a testament to its commitment to innovation and excellence.\nThe brewery's strategic use of technology sets a new standard in the craft beer industry, demonstrating the potential of connected product technology and cloud platforms like Cellr in enhancing brand engagement and driving successful outcomes.\nHill says Cellr is seeing a noticeable increase in the adoption of connected consumer experiences, which is being driven by consumer demands.\n“Today's modern, 'connected' consumers demand trust, transparency, and immersive experiences that elevate the quality of a brand's product or service. They seek personalised interactions, sustainability initiatives that align with their values, and a guarantee of quality and veracity,” Hill said.\nFor brands looking to meet these demands, the rewards of data analytics for deeper consumer insights cannot be overstated, according to Hill.\nThe adoption of this technology allows brands to innovate in meeting these demands, offering a significant advantage through the real-time data generated from digital interactions, which, in turn, informs strategic decision-making and enhances consumer engagement.","length":3919,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,8,7,9,9,8],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about Bridge Road Brewers' innovative use of printed QR codes to enhance consumer engagement and secure a top-ranking in the GABS Hottest 100 Craft Beer Poll.

With her recent appointment, she's not just navigating ships but also charting a new course for women in maritime careers. Shahsirehka's journey into this historically male-dominated field began at the Akademi Laut Malaysia (ALAM), where she pursued nautical studies. Reflecting on her experience, she said she don't feel awkward working in a male-dominated industry at all but determined to make her mark. \"I don't feel weird working in a male-dominated industry since I studied in ALAM with almost 90 per cent of them being males,\" she said in an exclusive interview with Sinar Daily. Her academic background laid a solid foundation for her subsequent ventures in the maritime world. What sets Shahsirehka's story apart is her resilience and determination. Despite being the sole applicant for the position of harbour pilot, she seized the opportunity and emerged victorious. \"I am grateful to get this job,\" she expressed with a sense of accomplishment.\nMalaysia lags in female workforce participation: Gender pay gap, low representation cited\nBeyond gender: Women on the frontlines of Malaysia's solid waste management\n Transitioning from her previous roles as a seafarer on tankers to a harbour pilot, Shahsirehka notes the stark differences in her work environment and responsibilities. \"Compared to my previous jobs, I used to get on tankers and now on every ship, I would say the exposure of working opportunity is high here, also different ship handling,\" she said. Politing the Challenges Addressing the challenges she faced, Shahsirehka acknowledges the prevailing mindset within the industry. \"One of the challenges I faced was people's mentality on the work and place I studied, since all the places I am in are male-dominated industries,\" she said. However, she credits effective communication and perseverance as key strategies in overcoming these obstacles. \"The only way to survive with those mentalities is to communicate well, discuss with the ship master, and people will eventually change their mindset and mentality,\" she asserts confidently. Family's Role to her Success Behind every successful person is a strong support system, and for Shahsirehka, it is her family. Hailing from an Indian background where societal norms often dictate career choices, she is grateful for her family's understanding and encouragement. \"I am lucky to have an understanding and supportive family who did not place barriers on my interest to venture into this job,\" she acknowledges gratefully. She said her mother, despite not furthering her studies, has been a pillar of strength, nurturing her daughters' ambitions. \"My mom is not educated but she managed to understand and raise her five daughters, following their interest to pursue their future,\" she adds. In addition to her family, she acknowledges the unwavering support of her husband, a marine engineer, who comprehends the demands of her profession. Shahsirehka also stated that her husband has been her rock, stating that he has been extremely understanding of her role and duties as a harbour pilot and working hours. \"Not to forget my husband, who is a marine engineer, often understands me and my working hours,\" she said, highlighting the importance of mutual understanding in their relationship.","length":3648,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08 12:48:00","rating":[8,8,7,6,8,7,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about Shahsirehka's journey as a female harbour pilot, detailing her background, challenges faced, and the support she received.

The best toothpaste for you depends on your specific dental needs, whether that involves whitening your teeth, maintaining gum health or tackling other oral hygiene concerns.We talked to dentists about picking the perfect toothpaste for you, including key ingredients to look for and which ones to avoid. We also rounded up a handful of toothpastes that will deep clean your teeth, prevent cavities and freshen breath.SKIP AHEAD Best toothpaste for adults | How to shop for toothpaste | Toothpaste for specialized needsSelected.Our Top PicksBest sensitive toothpasteLearn moreHow we chose the best toothpastesAmerican Dental Association Seal of Acceptance: When you see the ADA’s Seal of Acceptance, it means the brand submitted data and other materials to the ADA and the organization determined that the product meets specified safety and efficacy requirements, explained Dr. Edmond Hewlett, professor at the UCLA School of Dentistry.Fluoride: All toothpastes with the ADA’s Seal of Acceptance contain fluoride, an ingredient experts told us is proven to be effective in fighting cavities.Flavor: As long as the toothpaste you choose has the ADA Seal, flavor is entirely a personal preference.Specialized options: In addition to protecting teeth from cavities, some toothpaste offers additional benefits like whitening, or is made for those experiencing tooth sensitivity, for example.Best toothpastes for adults in 2024Below, we highlighted basic toothpaste varieties and a few options designed for sensitive teeth, which experts said anyone can use, regardless of whether or not you are experiencing tooth sensitivity. If you’re looking for the best whitening or kids toothpaste, we rounded up ADA-accepted options separately. We included each product's flavor and the size of each tube.Best anti-cavity toothpasteParodontax Clean Mint Daily Fluoride ToothpasteFlavor: Mint | Size: 3.4 ouncesAim Cavity Protection GelFlavor: Ultra Mint | Size: 6 ouncesColgate Cavity Protection Fluoride ToothpasteFlavor: Mint | Size: 6 ounces (two tubes)Crest Cavity Protection Cool Mint GelFlavor: Cool Mint | Size: 4.2 ouncesSprinJene Fresh Boost Fluoride ToothpasteFlavor: Mint | Size: 5 ouncesQuip Mint Anticavity ToothpasteFlavor: Mint or Watermelon | Size: 4.6 ouncesPRO-SYS Mint Fluoride Toothpaste GelFlavor: Mint | Size: 4 ounces (three tubes)Best sensitive toothpasteSensodyne ToothpasteFlavor: Fresh mint and fresh impact | Size: 4 ounces (two tubes) | Select 2023 Wellness Awards WinnerCrest Pro-Health Gum and SensitivityFlavor: Mint | Size: 3.7 ounces (three tubes)CloSYS Fluoride ToothpasteFlavor: Gentle mint | Size: 7 ouncesAloeSense ToothpasteFlavor: Fresh mint | Size: 5 ouncesHow to shop for toothpasteWhen buying a new tube, there are three main questions you should consider, said Dr. Breno Reboucas, a professor at the Boston University School of Dental Medicine:Does it have the ADA seal of acceptance?Does it contain fluoride?Does it address any additional needs your specific teeth may require?All toothpastes that earn the ADA Seal of Acceptance contain fluoride, and while Hewlett said there’s been controversy over fluoride for decades, “it’s one of the most well-documented therapies in all of dentistry,” he explained. Additionally, toothpastes with the ADA Seal of Acceptance do not contain flavoring agents like sugar that cause or contribute to tooth decay.Aside from picking a toothpaste with the ADA Seal of Acceptance, choosing one is mostly a matter of personal preference, said Reboucas. As long as you do not select a fluoride-free option, anything you enjoy using is the right choice for you.Brushing your teeth with toothpaste is only one element of an oral care routine, according to Hewlett. In order to effectively remove plaque and prevent tooth decay, gingivitis, gum disease and bad breath, you should also visit your dentist regularly, as well as use mouthwash and floss daily (or use a water flosser).Toothpaste for specialized needsSome adults’ teeth have additional needs that specialized toothpaste options can address. Reboucas said specialized toothpastes contain specific active ingredients to help with issues like sensitivity and tartar build-up. Some whitening options are made with hydrogen peroxide, the same ingredient that is often found in other teeth whitening products, in order to remove surface stains from teeth. Anti-erosion toothpastes usually contain ingredients to restore the minerals in tooth enamel — like sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride — and harden them over time.Experts told us it’s important to speak with your dentist about your unique oral hygiene needs to decide if you should purchase specialized toothpaste. “Your dentist knows your oral health status better than anybody and is an advocate for your oral health, so consult with them and see what toothpaste they recommend for you,” Hewlett said.What about charcoal toothpaste, “natural” toothpaste and solid toothpaste?Dentists often field questions from patients about “trends” in the toothpaste space and whether these products are effective. We asked experts to share a few of the most common toothpaste trends they’re asked about and what we should know about them.Charcoal toothpasteCharcoal is often thought of as an ingredient that can absorb toxins and bacteria on your teeth or in your mouth — similar to how it purifies water. However, experts agree that you should not use it. There are no charcoal toothpastes with the ADA Seal of Acceptance, and a study published in The Journal of The American Dental Association found that there wasn’t enough evidence to support efficacy claims. Experts also said that using charcoal toothpaste may damage the outer layer of enamel since charcoal is abrasive.\"Natural\" toothpaste“Currently, the FDA does not define the term ‘natural toothpaste,’ which leaves consumers to define what natural means to them,\" said Dr. Kate Zoumboukos of SW Austin Dental. She said it’s common for the term “natural toothpaste” to describe options that are free of artificial flavors and ingredients, preservatives, sweeteners and dyes. Experts agree that any toothpaste marketed as \"natural\" is effective so long as it has the ADA Seal of Acceptance.Solid toothpasteToothpaste most often comes in a gel or paste form, but some brands sell solid toothpaste, usually in the form of a tablet you chew into a gum-like substance before brushing your teeth with it. There are no solid toothpaste options that have the ADA Seal of Acceptance, and thus they do not meet our experts’ guidance.Meet our expertsAt Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

The new makeup brush subscription service, founded by Houston-based Ellie","textContent":"Bondell could have gone the practical route when it came to brand marketing. The new makeup brush subscription service, founded by Houston-based Ellie Pettit, was built on a devotion to cleanliness and utilitarian tools like sponges, spoolies, and hair clips. A scientific, almost sterile campaign could easily have gotten the Bondell message across. Instead, Pettit went bold. “Don’t be dirty, darling…” reads the brand’s tagline, a cheeky turn of phrase that lives up to the brand’s glamorous, Old Hollywood-style visuals. “From the very beginning, I wanted the brand to feel fun,” Pettit says. “My branding is a bit crazy but it’s exactly how I always pictured it.” Bondell subscription kits are delivered every three months.To bring her vision to life, Pettit tapped Maguire Amundsen, a former assistant to Kylie Jenner. She launched her consulting brand, The Gracefull Project, when she moved to Dallas in 2022 and soon got connected with Pettit. Bondell officially launched in November of 2023. “I had spoken with a lot of people about the idea, but Maguire really believed in it from the beginning,” shares Pettit. “Don’t be dirty, darling” is the Bondell tagline.Part of the duo’s strategy is cultivating a community to get the word out about Bondell — zero dollars have been spent on advertising so far.“Something I learned in LA is to be really intentional with who you’re reaching out to and connecting with people who can really represent the brand,” Amundson notes. “We really sat down and combed through who we knew and who best aligned with the brand.” One of those contacts included celebrity makeup artist Kelli Anne. (“She was like, OMG, this is genius,” notes Amundson). Just last week, Bondell launched its first brand partnership with Skin Pharm, the popular skincare clinic with locations in Austin, Dallas, Charleston, Houston, Nashville, and Southlake. Skin Pharm’s new Eye Sculpt product will be included in upcoming Bondell subscription products. Bondell subscription kits include a set of five different makeup brushes, one makeup sponge, two hair clips, and one spoolie wand.Pretty Instagram imagery can only take a product so far. Thankfully, Bondell’s subscription kits, which include a set of five different makeup brushes, one makeup sponge, two hair clips, and one spoolie wand, were designed to elevate every moment of your routine. The silky, minimalist brushes are produced by a factory in the U.S. and are brandished with nothing more than Bondell’s signature slanted heart. “When it came to naming the brushes for a particular use we held off,” Pettit notes. “People are going to incorporate the brushes into their routine the way they want to. We feel confident that all five of the brushes you’re getting, sponge included, cover all the bases.” “Makeup brushes are all so different — the density, the hair, the handle material… there’s so much that goes into a good makeup brush,” says Amundson, who notes that she and Pettit use their Bondell brushes in entirely different ways. “We wanted to ensure we launched with the best, most universal products.” And though Pettit opted for a more glamorous aesthetic, that’s not to say a little science won’t make its way into Bondell’s messaging. “Makeup brushes can harvest all kinds of crazy microscopic stuff that can compromise the health of your skin,” Pettit adds. “I’ve been working with a dermatologist on getting some swabs and cultures to really start to gross people out.” Bondell subscription kits are delivered every three months and priced at $68.

You’re not alone. Millions of people experience long COVID, a frustrating collection of symptoms that persist long after the initial infection. Now, research from the University of Cambridge suggests a surprising culprit: low iron levels.Sources of ironIron is an essential mineral that plays a crucial role in the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Iron is also important for growth, development, normal cellular functioning, and synthesis of some hormones and connective tissue.We get iron from certain plant and animal foods, such as red meat and poultry. Plant-based sources contain non-heme iron, which is not absorbed as efficiently as the heme iron found in animal products. However, you can enhance the absorption of non-heme iron by consuming it with vitamin C or with animal proteins. COVID can disrupt how the body manages iron, causing either iron deficiency or abnormal iron storage. This can make the infection worse and affect recovery.Characteristics of long COVID The researchers closely studied a group of 214 people for one year after they first experienced symptoms of COVID-19. The experts analyzed various aspects of the participants’ health, including how much inflammation they had, how much iron was in their blood, how genes related to iron management were working, and how well red blood cells were being produced. By comparing this information, the researchers were able to identify a specific set of characteristics of long-term COVID-19.Inflammation and anemiaMany people involved in the study continued to have inflammation and signs of anemia, a condition where the body has fewer red blood cells, for up to a year. Anemia can make people feel tired and weak because the body’s tissues do not get enough oxygen. This is a frequent complaint among people with long COVID. The ongoing inflammation suggests that the body’s immune system is still active even though the initial infection is gone.COVID and abnormal iron levels The study revealed that individuals with long COVID had abnormal iron levels, suggesting an imbalance in how their bodies handle iron. Additionally, the researchers identified changes in genes that control iron management, indicating that COVID-19 might disrupt these regulatory mechanisms. This link implies that problems with iron management might play a role in how long COVID develops and how severe the symptoms become. Low iron and COVID recoveryThe study showed signs of a process called “stress erythropoiesis” in people with long COVID. This is when the body tries to quickly make more red blood cells in response to stress or inflammation, like an infection. The study suggests this process might not work properly in some people after a COVID-19 infection. “If this goes on for a long time, there is less iron for red blood cells, so oxygen is transported less efficiently, affecting metabolism and energy production, and for white blood cells, which need iron to work properly,” said study co-author Hal Drakesmith from the University of Oxford. “The protective mechanism ends up becoming a problem.”The researchers noted that there could be a role for iron supplementation during the acute phase of COVID-19 infection, as well as a role as potential treatment for long COVID.Symptoms of long COVIDThe condition can cause a variety of health problems that last for months. Many people with long COVID experience extreme tiredness, even after they rest. They may also have trouble concentrating, remembering things, and focusing, which is sometimes called brain fog. Other common symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain, and difficulty doing activities that were easy before, like walking or climbing stairs. Individuals with long COVID may experience heart problems like heart palpitations, chest pain, or a fast heart rate. It can also cause ongoing pain and aches in muscles and joints.Some people lose their sense of taste or smell, and these senses may not come back completely. Others have trouble sleeping, either because they have trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or their sleep is not refreshing. They may also experience mood swings, anxiety, or depression. In addition, digestive problems like nausea, diarrhea, stomach aches, or loss of appetite may also persist.Another symptom of long COVID is post-exertional malaise, which means that a person’s symptoms get worse after they do physical or mental activities. All of these problems can make it difficult for people to participate in daily activities.Recovering from long COVIDIf you’re experiencing long COVID, here are some steps you can take to improve your overall well-being:Talk to your doctorIt’s important to get a complete evaluation from a healthcare professional to rule out other possible conditions and develop a personalized treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.Manage your symptomsThis may involve using medication for pain relief, breathing exercises to improve lung function, or other therapies depending on your specific symptoms.Consider physical and cognitive rehabilitationPhysical therapy and graded exercise programs can help manage fatigue and improve physical function, while cognitive rehabilitation techniques can address brain fog and other cognitive issues.Prioritize a balanced dietEating a healthy and balanced diet can help manage your symptoms and support your overall health. In some cases, your doctor may recommend supplements to address any nutritional deficiencies.Seek mental health supportDon’t hesitate to seek help if you’re struggling with anxiety, depression, or other emotional challenges associated with long COVID. Therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) can be very helpful.Pace yourself and manage your energyLearn to listen to your body and pace your activities to avoid pushing yourself too hard and experiencing worsening symptoms. Balance rest and activity to manage your energy levels effectively.Be patient and adaptableLong COVID can be unpredictable, and your symptoms may fluctuate over time. It’s important to monitor your progress and adjust your treatment plan as needed in collaboration with your doctor.Stay informedResearch on long COVID is ongoing, and new treatment options may become available in the future. Stay informed about the latest developments through reliable sources.Remember, long COVID affects everyone differently. The key is to find a personalized approach that helps you manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life.The study is published in the journal Nature Immunology.—–Like what you read?

An ill-judged spat with a much-loved Scottish lager brand; anger over the revelation that it was going to stop paying Britain’s real living wage; a skit that appears to make fun of the middle-aged, baseball-capped owners; an arch review of the brewery’s flagship London bar, which describes it as an “infernal pint crèche for confused children and the wife-dodging salarymen they’ll one day become.”\nAs one Twitter user put it recently, “When you see Brewdog trending it’s never because they’ve made a lovely new beer, is it?”\nFor Brewdog, ruffling feathers has long been a key part of the business model. From its early tussles with cask-ale consumer group CAMRA to taking on Vladimir Putin, Brewdog and its CEO James Watt have thrived on confrontation and controversy. “If we didn’t find a way to do things unconventionally, we wouldn’t have got our message out there, we would have got lost,” as Watt himself put it last year.\n\t\t\tGet the latest in beer, wine, and cocktail culture sent straight to your inbox.\nThis appears to have served Brewdog well. Founded in 2007, it runs 72 bars in the U.K.; global revenue grew 13 percent to £321 million ($406 million) last year, although there was a significant operating loss of £24 million ($30 million). It has raised more than £80 million ($101 million) of crowdfunded cash from around 200,000 small investors, creating an army of so-called “Equity Punks” in the process.\nBut as the social media response suggests, many Britons have had enough of Brewdog’s schtick. Even as the company continues to expand — and as rumors of a forthcoming IPO circulate — it remains a lightning rod for criticism, most recently when complaints it made about a BBC documentary were rejected by Ofcom, Britain’s television regulator. The response from online commentators was not sympathetic.\nSo how did Britain’s most important modern brewery accumulate so many, to use Watt’s own term, haters?\nFrom the start, Brewdog has aimed to be different to the British brewing establishment. To make sure everyone understood this, the brewery hired Manifest, a then-recently established London-based brand communication agency, in 2009. According to Alex Myers, Manifest founder and CEO, the brief was simple: “Redefine beer in the U.K., and we’ll do the rest.”\nA series of headline-grabbing escapades followed, making Brewdog the most talked-about brewery in the U.K. — but the aim wasn’t to be controversial, Myers insists. “The strategy was to make everyone as passionate about craft beer as we are,” he adds. “There was a no-holds-barred approach, doing what we felt we should do, rather than what was expected of us.”\nThis reflected Watt’s own approach to business, as outlined in his book “Business For Punks,” but gradually, and perhaps inevitably, some of those people Brewdog felt were its natural audience were turned off. In 2015, for example, Watt and co-owner Martin Dickie were accused of mocking trans women and homeless people in an ad that saw them dressed as sex workers.\n“If you’re the voice of the community, you need to remain anchored to the community,” says Myers. “Continually moving, continually evolving, continually reading the room.” At some point, Brewdog stopped doing this — perhaps when, as Myers points out, it stopped being the plucky outsider. “You’ve done this David-versus-Goliath thing, and now you’re Goliath,” he says.\nManifest’s working relationship with Brewdog ended in 2019 amid a row over an alcohol-free beer, but Myers insists there are no hard feelings. The same is not necessarily true in Britain’s craft-brewing world.\nMcKay worked as a designer at Brewdog between 2013 and 2018, seeing first-hand how things were done, and how Brewdog enjoyed bending the truth in its marketing.\nIn 2015, New Zealand’s Yeastie Boys launched in the U.K., with beer contract-brewed at Brewdog. That agreement lasted about 18 months before being canceled abruptly in 2017, ostensibly because Brewdog had decided to get out of contract brewing. Stu McKinlay, co-owner of Yeastie Boys, says he managed to negotiate an extra three months, but the experience left a sour taste. “I didn’t want to say too much [then] because I didn’t want to rock the boat,” he says.\nAt the time, perhaps, other brewers were loath to criticize Brewdog, but that didn’t last long. In 2017, Brewdog sold a big chunk of the business to San Francisco private equity house TSG Consumer. Not only had Brewdog spent the previous 10 years railing against similar investment, but it raised as-yet unanswered questions about the company’s dubious Equity For Punks scheme, as covered by VinePair contributing editor and columnist Dave Infante. And then, in 2021, an open letter from a group of ex-employees called Punks With Purpose highlighted what it called the “rotten culture” at the heart of Brewdog.\nBrewdog’s response was conciliatory, but a subsequent BBC documentary saw it come out fighting. Much ire was focused on Charlotte Cook, who worked at Brewdog between 2012 and 2014 and is now head brewer at Coalition Brewing in London. She was one of more than 300 signatories and appeared in the documentary, discussing her experiences of sexism at the brewery’s Ellon base.\nBrewdog’s subsequent complaint focused in part on her involvement, which they insisted constituted being a “de facto researcher, evidence gatherer, and participation encourager” for the program. Ofcom did not agree, saying that there was no basis for this claim. “I feel vindicated, because I was accused of something preposterous,” Cook says.\nRob McKay, another Punks With Purpose signatory who now works for Scottish brewery Fierce, was also interviewed. McKay worked as a designer at Brewdog between 2013 and 2018, seeing first-hand how things were done, and how Brewdog enjoyed bending the truth in its marketing. He cites the much-repeated origin story of the founders’ meeting with Michael Jackson — even though there is no pictorial evidence of Watt having been there. “If James was there, he would have had his picture taken with him,” McKay says.\n(Brewdog declined to respond to our questions about the Ofcom ruling or Yeastie Boys, saying that the company had moved on. “We’ve been recognized as a Sunday Times Best employer and a U.K. Top Employer two years in a row, which perhaps gives you some insight into [our] culture,” a spokesman added.)\nBrewdog’s abrasive approach has paid off in terms of public recognition, but it has also stored up a lot of bad feeling. It also means that for many Britons, Brewdog is craft beer — which is not necessarily a good thing. For many Britons, “craft beer” now means empty rhetoric and unappealing fussiness.\nIn 2021, British comedian Alistair Green produced “Punk Squirrel IPA,” an online skit featuring two middle-aged men, both called Matt, who’ve set up a “craft-beer company”; the satire is based on the distance between their cringe-inducing chat, their skateboards and devil horns’ hand gestures, and the reality of their middle-aged, middle-class lives and desires. It struck a chord with viewers, becoming one of Green’s most-watched films on a variety of platforms.\nWhat’s striking is that the sketch isn’t actually about Brewdog (it was inspired by Beavertown, Green says), but everyone assumes it is. “Whenever Brewdog does something stupid — which happens frequently — I get tagged into it online,” Green adds.\nBrewdog appears to have decided to make a break with the past. James Watt does most of his communicating via LinkedIn these days, occasionally popping up on the Instagram account of his girlfriend, reality TV star Georgia Toffolo. The beers also seem more conservative now, following public demand rather than leading it: Black Heart, a nitro stout, emerged in the wake of the recent trend for similar beers, for example.\nThe brewery’s increasing conservatism may or may not have something to do with a much-touted IPO, which could take place this year. It would make sense, as the deal with TSG Partners, which guaranteed the latter a compounding 18 percent annual return on its initial £213 million  investment ($269 million, for 23 percent of the business), runs out in August.\nWhat then? Go for an IPO, find new investment — or maybe sell to a bigger brewer? You can imagine the fallout. British drinkers would have good reason to be more than just bored about that.","length":8512,"publishedTime":"03-07-2024","rating":[3,5,6,4,7,5,4],"reason":"The article provides information with some inaccuracies and bias towards criticizing Brewdog, affecting the objectivity.

A leading human rights group has also raised concern over the fine, which was issued by the head of KRRiT, Maciej Świrski, an appointee of the former ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has led a long-running campaign against TVN.\nDecyzja Przewodniczącego KRRiT w sprawie audycji „Bielmo. Franciszkańska 3” nadanej na antenie TVN 24.\nThe decision concerns a documentary released by TVN in March 2023. It claimed that the future Pope John Paul II, while still archbishop of Kraków, knew of sexual abuse by priests subordinate to him but allowed them to continue working in the church and may even have tried to prevent the authorities from learning of their crimes.\nThe documentary focused on how the pope dealt with three particular cases of priests responsible for abuse, presenting new evidence, including accounts directly from victims and witnesses, files from the communist-era security services, and an interview filmed undercover with a former employee of the Kraków diocese.\nThe broadcast sparked a debate and some calls to reevaluate the legacy of John Paul II, who is a national hero in Poland due to both his religious leadership and his role in opposing communism.\nBut it was also criticised by many conservative figures, including from the PiS government that was then in power. The party’s chairman, Jarosław Kaczyński, described the report as a “scandalous, defamatory, coordinated media witchhunt aiming to destroy the authority of the greatest Pole in our history”.\nTens of thousands, including government ministers, attended marches in Poland today honouring Pope John Paul II.\nThis year's anniversary of his death took on particular significance due to recent reports claiming he was negligent in dealing with sex abuse https://t.co/IeRBnAHJgU\nIn a statement yesterday, the KRRiT revealed that it had received 6,058 complaints about TVN’s programme – the highest number in the regulator’s history – signed by almost 40,000 Polish citizens.\nFollowing an investigation, it found that TVN’s material “failed to meet the standards of journalistic ethics”. It was “biased, prepared with a selective selection of sources, and an ahistorical interpretation of facts and events” with “the entire narrative adjusted to a previously stated thesis”.\nThe KRRiT criticised the programme-makers for relying on files produced by the communist-era security services – who were involved in repression of the church – and claimed that they had failed to consult other sources.\nThe regulator also claimed that the documentary “was contrary to the law and social good, harming religious feelings, in this particular case of Catholics, and disinforming public opinion”. Offending religious feelings is a crime in Poland carrying a potential prison sentence of up to two years.\nA man has been detained on suspicion of vandalising a statue of former Pope John Paul II.\nHe is charged with “offending religious feelings” and “insulting a monument”, crimes in Poland that could result in a prison sentence of up to two years https://t.co/qggoOy8L1W\n“Media freedom and freedom of public expression are not limitless. Journalists need to act within a specific legal framework,” the KRRiT added, citing provisions on the journalistic duty to provide reliable information and to respect the religious feelings of the audience.\nAs a result of the failings identified by the KRRiT’s investigation, its president, Świrski, issued TVN with a fine of 550,000 zloty (€128,000).\nIn response to the decision, TVN released a statement saying it “has no basis in fact, undermines media freedom and is an attempt to impose censorship…and intimidate our editorial offices”.\n“The mission of journalists is to inform and reveal facts – including those that show the difficult truth,” wrote the broadcaster, announcing that it will appeal Świrski’s decision in court.\nPrzedstawiamy oświadczenie redakcji TVN24 w związku z decyzją przewodniczącego Krajowej Rady Radiofonii i Telewizjihttps://t.co/H8Mctqy1WP\nThe KRRiT’s conclusions were also questioned by Konrad Siemaszko, a lawyer from the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFHR), who argued that it is not the regulator’s role to assess the veracity of programming.\n“Such a high penalty can be interpreted as a form of suppressing historical debate, which should take place among historians and journalists without fear of a penalty of half a million zloty,” Siemaszko told TOK FM.\nHe also pointed to the fact that Świrski, an outspoken conservative figure who was made head of the KRRiT by the then PiS majority in parliament in 2022, has issued a series of large fines against liberal media outlets, including Radio Zet and TOK FM, as well as TVN.\nTVN has regularly been criticised by PiS, whose deputy leader called it a “pro-Russian Soviet creation”.

(AP/Yonhap)\n When Donald Trump was president of the US, the situation on the Korean Peninsula was turbulent, to say the least.During the first year of his term in 2017, the hair-trigger situation had many fearing that a war was imminent. After an inter-Korean summit in 2018 was followed by a first-ever North Korea-US summit that same year, expectations grew for a potential end to the Cold War system and a new peace regime.But when the North Korean and US heads of state met again in Hanoi in February 2019, they ended up leaving without any agreement to show for it. North Korea’s relationships with South Korea and the US rapidly cooled — to the point where those fears of war have been making a reappearance of late.What changes lie in store for the Korean Peninsula if a second Trump presidency comes to pass?“There are people who are tired of the absence of ‘stable discussions’ under the Joe Biden administration, and they’re hoping that the unpredictability associated with the Trump presidency could change the situation,” said Inje University professor and former Minister of Unification Kim Yeon-chul in a recent interview with Hankyoreh 21.“The reality is nothing like that. When it comes to foreign affairs and national security, the most important thing strategically is to increase predictability,” he continued. “Increased uncertainty is a threat to security in and of itself.”Kim also observed that the “international order surrounding the peninsula has completely changed from before.”“If Trump comes back to office, the situation will be very different from his first term,” he predicted.He went on to stress that the current moment “calls for careful efforts to prevent any unintended clashes.” The interview took place on the afternoon of Feb. 26 at the Yeouido offices of Korea Peace Forum, where Kim is chairperson of the board.\n Kim Yeon-chul served as minister of unification under President Moon Jae-in. (Kim Jin-su/The Hankyoreh) \n  “Gray area” between N. Korea and Russia, economic cooperation between N. Korea and ChinaHankyoreh 21: North Korea has been talking about South Korea recently as one of “two countries” in a hostile relationship. We haven’t seen this kind of thing before. Kim Yeon-chul: At the moment, all dialogue channels between South and North have been cut off. Even when inter-Korean relations soured badly during the Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye administrations, they still had civilian channels and indirect dialogue between authorities.This is the first time since the announcement of the July 4 Joint Statement of 1972 that all avenues for contact have been blocked, including not only back channels between government institutions but all civilian, Red Cross, military, and government channels too.  The channels for the international dialogue — including between North Korea and the US — are similarly cut off.When North Korea talks about “two hostile countries,” it’s a reflection of that situation. It’s saying that it now views the Military Demarcation Line not as a “small dividing line” between South and North, but as a “big dividing line” within East Asia. This is qualitatively different from before. Hankyoreh 21: The international situation surrounding the Korean Peninsula has also been shifting rapidly.Kim: In a narrow sense, it’s the end of the era of US-China cooperation. In a broader sense, it’s the end of the so-called Yalta regime, referring to the postwar order created in the wake of World War II.It’s also true for the situation in the Middle East with the war in Gaza, but the system for reaching a consensus among the five permanent UN Security Council members on issues relating to North Korea has broken down.We’ve reached the point where the five UNSC permanent members won’t reach a unified conclusion no matter what North Korea does. That means the international joint response and approach with regard to North Korea policy are no longer operational.The breakdown that happened at the North Korea-US summit in Hanoi coincided with a period when the strategic competition between the US and China was intensifying.  If it hadn’t been for the failure to reach a deal in Hanoi, Korean Peninsula issues would have remained as a space allowing for minimal cooperation even amid the strategic rivalry between Washington and Beijing.North Korea ultimately made the decision to pursue its survival in the “north,” not just in diplomatic and military terms but in economic ones as well. Hankyoreh 21: North Korea’s cooperation with Russia and China has also been rapidly intensifying.Kim: When it comes to UNSC sanctions, there’s quite a large gray area on the border between what’s illegal and legal. Different countries have the discretionary power to make their own interpretations in that area.Since Russia is facing sanctions like North Korea, it’s likely to be proactive about interpreting the gray area. Also, when the UNSC is unable to play its part, that has a negative impact on how people view the implementation of sanctions.The economic cooperation between North Korea and Russia — which have grown much closer since Kim Jong-un’s visit to Russia in September 2023 — is likely to have taken shape around that gray area.In contrast with North Korea-China trade, there’s an element of comparative advantage to trade between North Korea and Russia. Russia’s Far East needs workers, and North Korea needs energy and food. They both have things they can exchange, so economic cooperation benefits both sides.Vladimir Putin appears likely to visit Pyongyang once the presidential election in Russia on March 15 to 17 is over. Since both sides are facing sanctions, they could also cooperate in ways that help them sidestep those sanctions.But trade between North Korea and China is essentially different. China seeks to replace the US as the guardian of international norms, so it refrains from illegal activity when possible. Nevertheless, China could also actively exploit these gray areas. Trade between North Korea and China basically consists of family visits and trade across the border, without much of a commercial foundation. Since the two countries share many of the responsibilities for the border, they’re certainly capable of arranging trade such that it wouldn’t be reflected in the statistics as official trade on ships and trains is. What’s next after the “strategic patience” of the Obama and Biden administrations? Hankyoreh: You’ve recently emphasized the need to examine the three bilateral relationships that constitute the North Korea-China-Russia triangular relationship.Kim: North Korea took full advantage of conflict between China and the Soviet Union in their triangular relationship during the Cold War. That was a distinct example of a small, weak country trapped between major powers gaining strategic advantage from the conflict between those powers.The current situation is completely different. Given the US’ intensifying strategic competition with Russia and China on the global stage, the three bilateral relationships between North Korea, China and Russia have entered their first virtuous cycle. That’s a new wrinkle in Korean Peninsula affairs.In particular, cooperation in the military area is likely to accelerate. I think that North Korea, China and Russia will strengthen military cooperation through the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation to the same extent as South Korea, the US and Japan increase their own military cooperation. There are already signs of China and Russia expanding joint military exercises around the Korean Peninsula. If North Korea becomes an active participant, then military cooperation could expand both in scale and frequency.Hankyoreh: Trump has basically clinched the presidential nomination for the Republican Party.Kim: In terms of the big picture, there has been considerable disappointment about two seasons of “strategic patience,” the first in the Obama administration and the second in the Biden administration. So some are arguing that the uncertainty brought by a second Trump term would actually be more advantageous than a more stable lack of negotiations.But that’s not the case at all. In the areas of foreign policy and national security, increasing predictability is of immense strategic importance. Increasing uncertainty is itself a threat to national security. An important factor in US policy toward North Korea policy is South Korean policy toward North Korea. One of the major reasons for the Obama administration’s “strategic patience” was that South Korean Presidents Lee Myung-bak and Park Geun-hye both adopted a hard-line stance on the North. In other words, the Yoon administration’s hard-line policy toward North Korea means that things are unlikely to change very much even if Trump returns to power.We need to refresh our memory about why the Hanoi summit ended in failure. An important part of dealing with problems is coordinating the two sides’ positions. That’s how you build trust and improve relations. It’s not a matter of choosing between top-down and bottom-up diplomacy. National leaders may get a good photo op out of a surprise meeting, but they won’t make an inch of progress without working-level negotiations to follow up on that meeting. In that respect, Yoon’s approach to diplomacy is similar to that of Trump. Without a change of course, everything is sure to end up just like the Hanoi summit. Trump administration likely to push for more defense cost-sharing Hankyoreh: If Trump is actually reelected, do you think we’ll see the kind of adventurous dealings between the US and North Korea that we saw in his first presidency?Kim: When it comes to diplomacy, it’s in your interest to have more options at your disposal. So I think the two sides could arrange a “political meeting.” Depending on the circumstances, the two leaders might even have another handshake.One of North Korea’s distinctive negotiating practices is for the leader to make grandiose displays of authority. There were serious consequences in North Korea for the Hanoi summit ending without a deal. If the North Korean and American leaders were to meet again, North Korea would take a much more rigorous and principled approach to the negotiations. And since the Hanoi fiasco is seared into his brain, Kim wouldn’t agree to negotiations at all without some kind of definite guarantee.At the time of the Hanoi summit, the US was more concerned with the political advantage that could be brought by the negotiations. That’s also why Trump thought no deal at all was better than a small deal involving North Korea closing a nuclear facility.North Korea’s nuclear arsenal is much more advanced now than it used to be, and North Korea, China and Russia’s triangular alignment is humming along in the diplomatic, military and economic domains. For the US, negotiating with North Korea would be much more challenging than it was back in 2019.South Korea and the US need to coordinate their policy toward North Korea, but that won’t be easy because of the Yoon administration’s fixed stance. That said, I don’t think we’ll see a repeat of the situation under US President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-sam where North Korea-US relations improved but inter-Korean relations did not.Ultimately, Trump in a second term would likely approve of a hard-line policy toward North Korea while making even tougher demands on South Korea related to defense cost-sharing and the cost of extended deterrence and deploying strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula. The same would go for the cost of joint military exercises.Trump could also ask for South Korea to share the cost or burden of the US’ international initiatives. What if, for instance, he asked for the operational scope of the South Korean Navy’s Cheonghae Unit, which is currently stationed off the coast of Somalia, to be expanded to conflict zones such as the Red Sea or the Strait of Hormuz? While the Cheonghae Unit deployment was approved by the National Assembly, such an additional request would surely stir up trouble in domestic politics. Economic impact must be borne in mind Hankyoreh: People are talking once again about a crisis on the Korean Peninsula.Kim: The main problem with North Korea’s claim that inter-Korean relations amount to a relationship between two hostile states is the term “hostile.” That needs to be replaced with “peaceful.” North Korea claims to be a nuclear weapon state, and the US provides South Korea with extended deterrence. What that means is that both sides have a nuclear deterrent, which implies mutually assured destruction — i.e., that everybody dies — in the event of an all-out war.The longer that military tensions are prolonged, the greater the likelihood of an accidental clash. When both sides are armed with nuclear weapons, neither side can respond to a local clash by launching an all-out war. That means that conventional warfare is likely to increase, as we’ve seen with India and Pakistan.That brings us to the most crucial logical error in the argument that South Korea should acquire its own nuclear weapons to counter North Korea’s. We must remember that nuclear armament can actually create an environment that provokes local clashes with conventional arms. That’s why the most important thing is decreasing the likelihood of accidental clashes.Rather than thinking solely of the domestic political benefits of taking a rigid line on North Korea, politicians need to bear in mind the economic impact. The longer that military tensions continue and the slimmer the chance of negotiations, the greater the impact on the financial market.Even amid the nuclear crises of the past three decades, we've never witnessed a true “Korea discount.” That’s because rising tensions have always been countered by diplomatic efforts. But that’s not true anymore. And in addition, the macroeconomic indicators don’t look good. The government needs to realize that there’s a good chance that a genuine “Korea discount” may be on the horizon. By Jung In-hwan, staff reporterPlease direct questions or comments to [english@hani.co.kr]","length":14335,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[6,8,7,7,8,6,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed analysis of the current situation on the Korean Peninsula, specifically focusing on the potential implications of a second Trump presidency.

The development of new quality productive forces must be realistic, adapt to local conditions and closely combine local resource endowments, industrial foundations and scientific research conditions. \nAt present, some regions and enterprises in China actually lack the resources and foundation to develop new quality productive forces. Some regions that lack a basic foundation should not package traditional investment projects on the grounds of developing new quality productive forces. Instead, they should prioritize the use of existing digital technologies and encourage and promote innovation, production efficiency and good management. China's brand transformation should be based on accelerating the increase of traditional productive forces rather than a blind pursuit of new conceptual ideas before they are correctly understood. \nNew quality productive force mainly comes from true originality and endogenous impetus. The key is whether the country can create the necessary institutional soil and policy environment suitable for the boom of new quality productive forces. Local governments should have a right understanding of the nature of the task, and refrain from turning the long-term efforts into a shortsighted campaign. \nOnly by actively developing new quality productive forces can we bring more development space and higher competitiveness to the future, and form a strong innovation support for traditional industries.","length":3157,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,8,8,7,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides factual information about China's focus on promoting the construction of a modern industrial system and developing new quality productive forces.

They liked how he did your SFX and makeup ... so what?,\" Radke added, \"AND THAT I TURNED INTO A WEREWOLF, that’s the point he should've transformed into a the creature of the black lagoon.\"From there, Radke explained a bit of his annoyance over what he felt was a rip off. \"You know what I think it is? I think it’s the fact that people don’t acknowledge the inspiration, like they see something doing good and try to do it, but pretend like they got it from somewhere else because they don’t want to come off like they’re jacking a current thing. for me I mention my inspirations In My music like it’s so obvious I grew up listening to Eminem and loved horror movies and Batman etc. you can hear my Eminem Inspiration in my rapping. And I literally say it in my songs. let’s make 2024 the year we give credit to each other. And stop lying. Bring me the horizon is inspiring. Bad omens is inspiring. Parkway drive is inspiring. architects is inspiring and so on.\"He then credited Bring Me the Horizon's Oli Sykes as someone who acknowledged the inspiration but still did something original, stating, \"oli Sykes went to the video director I use because he was inspired my mine, and guess what he told him 'I like what you did but I don’t want to copy' he went out of his way to make a video that was his own, I gained so much respect for oli after I was told this, this is what I mean. Instead of just ripping he went out of his way to do his own thing. I RESPECT THAT SHIT, same with ice nine kills they do there OWN THING. this is what I mean.\"READ MORE: Ronnie Radke Says It's Easier to Write a Metalcore Song Than a Hot 100 HitHe continued, \"Anyway, this copy cat stuff is so trivial, and at end of day will be forgotten, it’s trivial to get upset at, it should be flattering if anything.

In conversation with fellow actor and singer Halle Bailey on a new episode of Variety’s Actors on Actors series, Zegler said she feels “so thankful for those moments because they make me feel like solid Teflon”.“That nothing can hurt anymore because they’ve said the worst that can be said,” she explicated. “You just say, ‘Thank you so much for this. I have a lot of love in my life, and I’m very thankful.’ We get to do our work and have that speak for itself instead.”She shared that “choosing thankfulness and gratefulness is choosing peace”. “As much as you’d like to remind people verbally that being in the spotlight doesn’t absolve you of your humanity – that you’re allowed to have human moments – it doesn’t necessarily do what you want it to do. It fuels them more,” she acknowledged.“So it’s choosing to be present and know that they’re probably just having a really hard day. And I’m putting out a movie.”Bailey, who’s faced similar backlash for her casting as Ariel in the recent live-action Little Mermaid, agreed with Zegler’s words of wisdom.“I love the saying, ‘You throw stones, and I’ll build a bridge out of them’,” the 23-year-old Grown-ish alum added. “Stay grateful and ignore the hate.”In August, Zegler’s past remarks about Snow White reemerged online, sparking a new debate among fans who perceived her comments dismissed the original characters.During 2022 interviews, Zegler repeatedly expressed her distaste for the original storyline.“The original cartoon came out in 1937, and very evidently so. There’s a big focus on her love story with a guy who literally stalks her. Weird! Weird! So we didn’t do that this time,” she said in an October 2022 interview with ExtraTV. “We have a different approach to what I’m sure a lot of people will assume is a love story just because we cast a guy in the movie. All of Andrew’s scenes could get cut, who knows? It’s Hollywood, baby,” she added of her Prince Charming co-star Andrew Burnap.Since clips of her remarks resurfaced online, several commenters accused Zegler of “pseudo-feminism”.Zegler currently stars in the Hunger Games prequel The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes, which is out in cinemas now.","length":2641,"publishedTime":"2023-12-12T22:25:03.000Z","rating":[7,7,8,6,8,7,7],"reason":"The article presents factual information about Rachel Zegler's response to backlash regarding her casting in the Snow White live-action remake.

Here, experts share the best companion plants for tomatoes that will help your garden thrive.","textContent":"If you're thinking about growing tomatoes in your garden, you might want to consider companion planting. Companion planting is a method of placing certain plants together to help each other by reducing and repelling certain pests, adding nutrients to the soil, minimizing weeds, and generally encouraging each plant to thrive. Tomatoes have a couple of friendly companion plants that help produce beautifully juicy tomatoes. If you're unsure of where to start, we asked several gardening experts about which plants you should grow with your tomatoes, as well as some tips and tricks to keep in mind for a bountiful tomato harvest this year.\nGrowing tomatoes from seeds or seedlings takes several months before you'll reap the rewards of a juicy, fresh-off-the-vine ripe tomato. During that time, pests like hornworms or aphids may want to munch on the leaves, weakening the plant—but companion planting can help. \"Growing tomatoes with companion plants offers a range of benefits, from keeping unwanted pests at bay to attracting beneficial insects that help your tomatoes thrive,\" says Misti Mathis, co-owner of Harvest Gold Organics. \"Some companions even improve the soil and offer shade or support for your tomato plants, and some folks even believe they can enhance the flavor and growth of your tomatoes.\" \nPlants that don't get very tall, like many herbs, are wonderful companions to tomatoes because they can utilize space and reduce weeds. \"Using companion plants that cover the soil under staked tomatoes can conserve water and inhibit weeds,\" says Richard Zondag, horticulturist and retired president of Jung Seed Company. Plants that like each other mean a more successful garden and a better harvest. \nStart with these suggestions if you're looking for the right companion plants for your tomatoes.\nTomatoes, basil, and mozzarella make a delicious caprese salad and in the garden, basil and tomato plants are a splendid combination because they optimize soil space, provide shade, and repel pests. \"Basil is a good choice to plant with tomatoes because they are not in direct competition for space or nutrients,\" says Isabel Branstrom, vegetable product development manager for PanAmerican Seed. This savory herb emits scents that repel pests, too, notably thrip.\nChives are an herb and are part of the onion (or allium) family. They attract pollinators and resist pests making them a great companion plant. \"Chives can repel aphids, spiders, and mites that will damage the growth and fruiting of the tomatoes,\" says Zondag. And, according to Branstrom, when chives flower, they also attract bumblebees, which help with the pollination of tomato flowers.\nTomatoes and garlic make a delicious pairing, whether it's roasted tomatoes in garlic, tomato soup, or a garlicky tomato sauce. Garlic and tomatoes are garden pals, too. \"Garlic and tomatoes make great companion plants because garlic’s strong smell can help repel pests, such as aphids and spider mites, reducing the likelihood of infestations,\" says Carrie Spoonemore, co-creator of Park Seed’s From Seed to Spoon app. When grown near each other, fungi and diseases are reduced too, she adds. \nBecause lettuce grows low to the ground, it minimizes weeds and retains some of the moisture under the tomato plants. \"Lettuce is a cooler season crop, so it can benefit from the shade of a tomato plant,\" says Branstrom.\nA savory herb with oval, silvery-green leaves, sage is also considered one of the best companion plants for tomatoes. \"Its strong scent helps ward off unwanted tomato pests like cabbage moths and carrot flies, protecting your precious tomatoes from insect damage,\" says Mathis.\nThyme is a hardy herb that complements many savory dishes. In the garden, thyme and tomato grown together minimize pests while attracting pollinators. \"Thyme’s strong scent can help deter pests by masking the scent of tomatoes and making them less attractive,\" Spoonemore says. \"Thyme can also attract beneficial insects that prey on pests and help pollinate your tomato plants.\"\"\nPom-pom style flowers in vibrant hues of red, orange, or yellow, marigolds reduce unwanted insects that feast on tomato plants. \"Marigolds attract beneficial insects that prey on pests, leading to a healthier and more resilient plant,\" says Spoonemore. Some flowers can distract insects to their petals so they're less likely to bother your tomatoes.  \"A flower may be more attractive to an insect than a tomato plant due to color, scent, or even petal shape,\" says Branstrom. \"French marigolds contain the chemical limonene, which can deter white flies, another sap-sucking insect often found in vegetable gardens.\" \nBright reddish-orange hued flowers and sometimes bright sunny yellow, nasturtium flowers deter pests and protect the soil. \"Nasturtiums are beneficial to growing a healthy tomato because they keep away pests such as aphids and whiteflies, and their large, circular leaves spread across the topsoil like a blanket,\" says Mathis. \"This helps keep the soil from drying out, protects it from being washed away by rain, and even keeps the tomato roots nice and cool.\" \nHeather Kibble, home grown sales manager for Sakata Seed America, Inc, likes to plant nasturtiums in her landscape. \"I use a lot of nasturtiums around my garden,\" Kibble says. \"They bring brightly colored flowers, beneficial insects, hold back weeds, and are easy to remove if they start to take over.\" \nGardening often requires a bit of trial and error as you figure out what plants grow well in your region and get to know the areas in your garden with sufficient sunlight and quality soil. Companion planting for tomatoes can take some practice and patience. Keep the following tips in mind.\nOvercrowding your plants can prevent them from growing properly. \"It is tempting to space too close or overfill containers in the spring when the baby plants are tiny,\" says Kibble. \"If maximizing yield is your goal, be sure and give your plants the room they need to mature to full size.\" Otherwise, they may not have access to sufficient space for roots to grow, expand, and access water.\n\"Overplanting an area can leave plants competing for resources and prevent them from thriving,\" says Branstrom. \"The best way to avoid this is to follow spacing recommendations and keep in mind the mature size of each plant.\" She also suggests reading seed packets, plant tags, or seed companies’ websites for spacing and plant size guidance.\nZondag says that companion plants can be planted 4 to 6 inches away from the tomato plants without interfering with their root system.\nThink about what you hope to achieve with companion planting and plan your edible garden accordingly. Protecting the soil is important when gardening and deciding on companion plants. Plants that shade the soil keep moisture in the soil longer and inhibit weed seed germination, says Zondag.  \"You can use a spacing that aligns with your goals, [such as] planting lettuce in the row next to your tomato to utilize the shade,\" says Branstrom. \nChecking on your garden and looking at your tomato plants occasionally will provide clues to their health. You can also detect any pests when you're actively looking at the leaves. \"Regularly monitoring and addressing any potential pest or disease issues can help maintain a healthy and productive garden,\" says Spoonemore.  \nAll plants need water, soil, and sun to thrive. \"Knowing how big each plant will get helps them all work together without fighting for resources,\" says Mathis. If plants become too big and compete with each other for space, it can lead to stunted growth or fungal diseases. \"Good airflow between plants also helps minimize disease, as it gives foliage a chance to dry and not foster mildew,\" says Branstrom.\nEveryone wants to grow their favorite herbs, veggies, and flowers. Before digging into companion planting, know what plants grow well in your climate zone. Some plants do best in certain areas, while others won't grow at all, so plan for success by knowing what thrives in your local area.\nPlants extract nutrients from the soil. Adding compost to the soil and changing the placement of where you plant each season are ways to add nutrients and keep the soil healthy. \"Another common mistake is not rotating plants every season to prevent nutrition depletion or replenishing the soil with natural fertilizers or compost,\" says Spoonemore. Not only is rotating crops beneficial for the soil, it's a simple way to reduce pests and diseases. \"Switch up where you plant things each year so pests and diseases don't settle in any one area,\" says Mathis.\nWhen you start growing a garden, it's easy to think you'll remember all the details of what you planted and when. But then, the plants grow, and you may not recognize the landscape. Take notes or have a designated garden journal where you sketch what you planted, jot down the date, variety, and any other piece of information that may be helpful during the growing season or even a year later when you're planning your garden again. \"There is a lot of trial and error that goes into companion planting and deciding what works best for your garden,\" says Branstrom. \"It is important to remember what you tried, the successes and the failures, so you can continue to enjoy the fruit of your labor (and learning each season!).\"","length":9965,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,9,8,7,9,9,8],"reason":"The article provides accurate information on companion planting for tomatoes, explaining the benefits and recommendations from gardening experts.

He blames his lack of sales on the 1970s gas crisis caused by “towel-headed sheiks holding back their oil” and the “swarthy, brooding influence” of “cutthroat Jewish style” on the free enterprise","textContent":"Deadpan follows the misadventures of a vaguely antisemitic West Virginia Buick dealer who wakes up one day transformed into the world’s most popular Jewish comedian. Steeped in magical realism, the narrative confronts the urgent issues of our day: Identity, intolerance, tribalism, and the transformative power of humor. \nIt’s the end of an ordinary day for Dwight Bridges: Poor business as usual at his Buick Dealership in Hoggzswallow Hollow, West Virginia. He blames his lack of sales on the 1970s gas crisis caused by “towel-headed sheiks holding back their oil” and the “swarthy, brooding influence” of “cutthroat Jewish style” on the free enterprise system. \nLest you stop reading here, Deadpan by Richard Walter (Heresy Press) is not a cranky racist rant. On the contrary, the book “confronts the incendiary issues of our day: hate speech, bigotry (particularly antisemitism), and racial/religious identity,” says the author in an interview on his publisher’s website. \nThe book is also a trip to an alternate reality of overlapping multiverses, timelines, and characters that spin together like a kaleidoscopic cartwheel. When Dwight flips off the showroom lights his dealership disappears. He’s in a backstage dressing room, and he’s no longer bald. And instead of his ratty wool sweater, he’s wearing a maroon tuxedo jacket and a ruffled blue silk shirt.\nThis is where Rod Serling introduces the next “Twilight Zone” episode, he suspects. But instead, he hears a heavy knock on the door and a voice saying “Five minutes, Mr. Ritchie! Five minutes!”\nRitchie? Who’s Ritchie, Dwight wonders. And five minutes to what? Seeking to escape, he stumbles onto a stage before an audience of thousands, including the Shah of Iran and his entourage in the front row. Even more puzzling, when Dwight tries to explain his predicament —“I’m an automobile dealer from Hoggzswallow Hollow, West Virginia” — the audience seems familiar with his words and repeats them with him, laughing and clapping. \nIt seems that Dwight has become a Jewish comedian named Richie Ritchie, and the whole world loves his stand-up patter. Soon, Richie Ritchie gets a master class in American humor as part of a panel discussion with comic luminaries Mel Brooks, Milton Berle, Don Rickles and Jerry Lewis. (They also moon him.)\n “You take all the madness in the world,” says Brooks, “you turn it around, you give it your own perspective…”\n“You say something in a new light,” adds Rickles. “And then you got comedy.”\n“You show the people,” says Berle, “something in some way they… haven’t seen it yet in that way, that particular way, till before you just now showed it to them, and what you get in that case is comedy.”\n“I happen to view the audience as the central entity in the performance process,” contributes Lewis. “It’s to them, God willing, we turn and with His good grace we attempt to reach their humanity.”\nDeadpan’s author knows from audience. Walter is also a successful screenwriter and a retired professor who for several decades led the screenwriting program at UCLA’s film school. He’s also Jewish and knows from antisemitism.\nBack in Hoggzswallow Hollow (time and place are fluid), Dwight is cajoled into joining his fellow Dixieland garage band members on a midnight run to spray-paint antisemitic slogans on the town’s synagogue. The best (i.e., worst) Dwight can muster is “Dump Kissinger.” \nRabbi Solomon Geffner wants to scrub off the paint and forget about the vandalism. “If we wallow in outrage over slogans painted on a wall, if we marinate in vitriol over insults and slights, what’s left for the Holocaust?” he poses to Officer Al Henderson of the Hoggzswallow Hollow police. Henderson, however, follows the forensic trail and arrests Dwight/Ritchie while he’s performing in Las Vegas and brings him back to West Virginia for trial. \nBut before that, Dwight/Ritchie finds himself in Tehran as a guest of Shah Reza Pahlavi (an avid Ritchie fan), who has a secret project with Israel’s Mossad: a positron emission muon ionic holographic tele-transporter that zaps Ritchie through the space/time continuum. \nThere’s also a World Series game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Yankees (the Shah is a Yankees fan), a Mayan-speaking gorilla, a strip chess game, an impromptu visit with U.S. President Sarah Palin in the emergency command center 100 feet below the White House, and a visit from a theoretical mathematician from an alternative era and parallel dimension.    \nWith so many opportunities to skewer bigotry and racism with farce and humor, Walter hints he “quite possibly” may write more books in this vein. \nRichard Walter is an author of best-selling fiction and nonfiction, celebrated storytelling educator, screenwriter, script consultant, lecturer and retired professor who led the screenwriting program in the film school at UCLA for several decades. He has written scripts for the major studios and television networks; lectured on screenwriting and storytelling and conducted master classes throughout North America as well as London, Paris, Jerusalem, Madrid, Rio de Janeiro, Mexico City, Beijing, Shanghai, Sydney and Hong Kong.\nHis latest novel, Deadpan, is published by Heresy Press.  Subscribe to his podcast on Substack and blog on Medium, and follow him on Twitter and Facebook.\n Publish Date: February 15, 2024 Genre: Fiction, Satire Author: Richard Walter Page Count: 246 pages Publisher: Heresy Press ISBN: 9798988717317","length":5649,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T18:44:59+00:00","rating":[7,6,8,7,8,7,8],"reason":"The article provides an accurate description of the novel \"Deadpan\" by Richard Walter, focusing on its themes of identity, humor, and confronting intolerance.

Keep in mind, the main target is the big flan in the middle, so the best bet is eliminating the minions it deploys as soon as possible in order to start dealing some damage to the main target. Instead of restricting their roles to one, make each as versatile and self-reliant as possible. Best set-up would be having each robot have their own magic specialty. For instance, one with fire, one with a blizzard, and one with lightning attack. As such, you will also be more impervious to having multiple weaknesses. \nKeep your cost as minimum as possible so you can deploy more robots faster. You can do this, by attaching the action “Cost-20”. However, like all elemental attacks, this can only be applied once. There is also action “Cost-40 | HP-200” which reduces your robots hp, but don’t let the HP reduction scare you. The benefits of having their actions cost less, outweigh the downside of having less HP.\nBest Loadouts for Gears and GambitFor Protorelic Phenomenon 1 and 2, we recommend you either stick with Chadley's pre-built loadout or create something similar to the image below. \nFor Protorelics 3 and 4, especially for the last one, create a loadout like the image below.

Note that these plants are flowering, unlike those the scientists engineered to delay flowering indefinitely to maximize their accumulation of biomass.\n UPTON, NY — Scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory and Oklahoma State University have identified key genes and the mechanism by which they control flowering in sorghum, an important bioenergy crop. The findings, just published in the journal New Phytologist, suggest strategies to delay sorghum flowering to maximize plant growth and the amount of biomass available for generating biofuels and bioproducts.\n“Our studies elucidate the gene regulatory network controlling sorghum flowering and provide new insights into how these genes could be leveraged to improve sorghum for achieving bioenergy goals,” said Brookhaven Lab biologist Meng Xie, one of the leaders of the research.\nSorghum is particularly well suited for sustainable agriculture because it can grow on marginal lands in semiarid regions and can tolerate relatively high temperatures. Like many plants, its growth and flowering (reproductive) cycles are regulated by the duration of daily sunlight. And once plants start to flower, they stop growing, which has important implications for the accumulation of biomass.\nFor example, one natural sorghum variety can reach nearly 20 feet in height, only transitioning to the reproductive flowering phase near the end of the summer growing season when the duration of daylight diminishes. Other “day-neutral” lines flower earlier, after reaching about three feet in height, producing less vegetation but more grain.\n“While these earlier flowering varieties might be preferable when growing sorghum as a food source, for bioenergy production, we prefer sorghum to have later flowering. That gives the plants more time to grow and accumulate biomass in the stems and leaves,” Xie said.\nUnderstanding the genes that control these different flowering times — a long-sought goal for plant scientists — might point to ways to optimize sorghum for either desired outcome.\nWith the bioenergy production goal in mind, the Brookhaven team started by exploring a gene that had been previously identified as associated with later flowering, known as SbGhd7. The association between this gene and later flowering was based on statistical predictions from genome-wide studies, but it had not been validated with experimental data — and its mechanism of action was completely unknown.\n“Our study provided direct evidence to support this gene’s function in flowering control and also helped us understand its molecular mechanism,” said Brookhaven Lab postdoctoral fellow Dimiru Tadesse, first author on the study.\nThe first evidence came from transgenic sorghum plants engineered at Oklahoma State to overexpress the purported flowering-control gene. Sorghum varieties that overexpressed this gene — that is, made its protein product in abundance — didn’t just delay flowering; they never flowered at all.\n“This was a dramatic difference from what happens in rice plants when they overexpress their version of this same gene,” Xie noted. “In rice, overexpression of this gene delays flowering for eight to 20 days — not forever!”\nThe transformed sorghum plants had more than twice the biomass of control plants.\nTo find out why, Xie and his team wanted to unravel the details of how this gene operated within cells.  Their goal was to see how the protein that is coded for by the flowering-repressor gene interacted with other genes.\nDoing these studies in actual plants would have taken months or years. So, instead, Xie and his colleagues at Brookhaven worked with individual plant cells.\nThey used plant cells whose outer cell walls had been removed. The “naked” plant cells, known as protoplasts, could easily absorb a plasmid, a small bit of DNA added to their growth medium. By putting the gene or genes they wanted to test into that plasmid, the scientists could get the plant cells to make the desired protein.\n“The plasmid will get into the cell and incubate overnight and the protein will have a very high level of expression,” Xie said. “It’s just a one-day procedure.”\nTo track what the protein made by the flowering-repressor gene was doing in the cells, the scientists attached another small protein to it to act as a sort of tag. Then they added antibodies designed to bind to the tag. If the flowering-repressor protein bound to other gene regions in the plant’s genomic DNA, the scientists could pull the whole antibody-protein-DNA complex out of the solution to sequence those gene regions.\n“This method, called ‘transient chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing’ or ‘Transient ChIP-seq,’ showed us where the protein that eliminates flowering binds to on sorghum genomic DNA,” Xie said. “It identifies the targets of this regulator protein in the sorghum genome.”\nThe scientists found that their flowering-repressor protein was binding to a lot of targets. These included other genes involved in turning flowering on.\n“There were some genes that were found previously to regulate flowering in other plant species, but their functions in sorghum, many of them, were still not fully studied,” Xie said.\nWhen collaborators at Oklahoma State produced sorghum plants that overexpressed those target genes, they found that the target genes induced early flowering. The repressor protein, the team reasoned, must therefore work by turning off those early flowering genes.\nWith their precision sequencing technique, the Brookhaven scientists identified the regulator protein’s specific binding site: a very short DNA sequence within the “on” switch, or promoter, for each individual target gene.\n“The promoter of each target gene is different, but they all contain this same short sequence,” Xie said. By binding, the repressor protein flips these on switches off.\nThe idea that the repressor protein could impact multiple targets was somewhat new.\n“Others had speculated that the original regulator protein only regulated one flowering activator. But we found it is much more complicated. In addition to regulating one suspected target activator, this protein also regulates several others — some directly and some indirectly,” Xie said. “It’s like a master regulator for turning off flowering.”\nThe practical application of these findings in making sorghum that doesn’t flower could have additional benefits for engineered sorghum. In addition to having increased biomass for biofuel production, these plants — with no flowers and no pollen — would be unable to share their altered genes with other closely related plants. This built-in gene containment might help potential growers meet the regulatory requirements for implementing such a strategy in real-world agricultural environments.\nThis work was funded by the DOE Office of Science through Brookhaven Lab’s Quantitative Plant Sciences Initiative and by the U.S. Department of Agriculture via collaborators at Oklahoma State University. The Transient ChIP-seq method for optimizing protoplast transformation, sample preparation, and sequencing was developed with Laboratory Directed Research and Development funding at Brookhaven Lab.\nBrookhaven National Laboratory is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy.

We feel comfortable up there and love to look down on other nations as sinners, usually with condescension. And where we believe to recognize misconduct, we quickly resort to public lecturing.\nAs determined as we Germans are to broadcast our views and trying to see through our – often ill-advised – policy positions, where we fail badly is at listening to our European partners.\nWorse, we do not even listen when they present us with their very legitimate views and positions. Since we always know better, why should we care about the views of others?\nExample 1: For years, Poles, Balts, Scandinavians and Ukrainians warned us about Nordstream 2 and our dependence on Russian gas. We not only ignored it, we arrogantly rejected it. After all, we knew better – until Russia invaded Ukraine and effectively turned off our gas tap.\nExample 2: For years, our European neighbors reacted to our withdrawal from nuclear energy only by shaking their heads collectively. \nAnd when they asked us in 2022 to keep our nuclear power plants running longer in view of the pan-European gas shortage, the resulting explosion in energy prices as well as rising CO2 emissions worldwide, the answer was a resounding “nyet” – unless one seriously wants to count a three-month extension of the plants’ operating lives.\nThat was all the German government – which generally advertises itself as the holy grail of CO2-free energies – was ready to concede. One German party’s ideological blinders simply trumps reason.\nNo surprise that today Germany has closed in on Poland as the front-runner in terms of high CO2 emissions. The German government doesn’t even feel ashamed. Instead, it digs itself in deeper in its utter self-righteousness.\nExample 3: In the context of the “EU taxonomy” – i.e., the question of whether certain investments can be recognized as sustainable – France and other EU partners demanded that nuclear energy also be recognized as sustainable. Their reasoning was straightforward enough: It is a CO2 emissions-low form of energy.\nThat did not keep ever the German government, in its sanctimoniousness, from running up a storm against this. It talked up the dangers of nuclear power, while staying completely mum on resuscitating lignite coal production, the most emissions-intensive form\nThe Scholz government, and especially the Greens as a junior partner in that government, talked condescendingly about France’s nuclear power plants. According to Germany’s megaphone diplomacy, French reactors were a big safety risk.\nAccording to the German telling, it was only German largesse, via the summertime export of electricity from renewable sources, that prevented chaos in France. What was left unsaid was that French reactors were going through a regularly scheduled maintenance cycle. And, of course, come winter, French nuclear energy helped Germans over the hump when their renewable energy sources didn’t produce any energy.\nWhat is so stunning about these German mind games is not just how self-serving and deliberately deceptive they are, but how much German politicians are caught in a web of nationalism (and self-righteousness).\nThe fact that the EU’s energy policy must be thought about, planned for and executed at least on a Europe-wide scale – but definitely not the nation state scale – evidently befuddles German policy makers.\nIn the end, as much as the German government huffed and puffed in trying to block France’s desire to have nuclear power to be deemed EU taxonomy compliant, it justifiably got nothing but a bloody nose.\nNo wonder there was – and is – also bad blood. Many people in France simply do not buy our assumption of moral supremacy.\nSentiments about competitiveness also enter into the Franco-German equation. When it comes to their nation’s reliance on nuclear energy, you will hear French friends say: \n“All you Germans want is to take away our last competitive advantage, namely cheap energy. You want to turn France into a poorhouse that in the global concert of great powers can no longer play beyond its weight class.” And they add: “That is undoubtedly also why you are fighting our arms exports.”\nExample 4: When it comes to migration policy, it is not only Germany’s neighbors to the east, but also the Danish, Swedish and Italian governments – including Giorgia Meloni’s predecessors – who long considered Germans as blind optimists. \nIn addition to the bizarre German denial of the obvious existence of pull factors, our European partners rightfully criticize us for aiding and abetting criminal smuggling organizations through sea rescue missions (and promoting them through government subsidies handed to NGOs). This has even triggered diplomatic entanglements with Italy.\nThe story line is always the same: With moral vehemence, we Germans try to justify our unilateral actions at the European level and want to foist them on our partners as superior and future-oriented objectives.\nIn the meantime, many European countries have made a partly radical turnaround in migration and refugee policy. There are also signs of a broad change of course on the issue of nuclear power.\nWhile Finland is using cheap nuclear power to qualify for hydrogen production as an electricity storage facility, we Germans are trying to establish subsidies for our industry affected by high electricity prices. They not only cost the taxpayers billions, but their compatibility with EU law is still in question.\nMost recently, Chancellor Olaf Scholz made global headlines with public statements triggering fierce reactions in London and Paris, Germany’s most important European partners.\nThe first was his suggestion that there were British boots on the ground in Ukraine. Commenting on his decision to not provide Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine, the Chancellor said Germany couldn’t do what the UK was doing — which was understood to mean providing on the ground support in Ukraine to operate Storm Shadow cruise missiles. Whether true or not, the UK rightfully considered this as interfering with UK military secrets. \nThe Chancellor’s predilection to interfere in UK affairs continued when he suggested that the British High Court should not allow the extradition of Julian Assange. To qualify the reactions in London as “eyebrows raised” is an understatement only an Englishman could get away with.\nBeing “not amused” by statements by the German chancellor was a feeling shared in Paris last week. The week had started with Scholz making several media and video statements saying he would never, ever allow German soldiers to be involved in the war in Ukraine.\nThis was seen as an overly aggressive rejection of the deliberate expression of strategic ambiguity proposed by France’s President Emmanuel Macron. In a press conference in Paris, Macron had said he wouldn’t rule out anything to defend Ukraine – not even sending French troops.\nThese events illustrate the widening gap between European allies in strategic defense matters and an SPD-led Germany driven by that party’s customary mix of very public displays of indignation, self-righteousness, geopolitical naiveté, narrow national thinking and an irrepressible urge to please Moscow. \n1. How long will our European partners continue to accept Germans’ self-righteous attitudes?\n2. When will the new wave of German nationalism finally become too embarrassing for the Scholz government?\n3. When will Germans collectively wake up from the dream of single-handedly standing as the apostle of a better world?\nA better world that we hope to bring about without effort, without compromise and without coordination, never mind harmony with our partners.","length":8025,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T00:09:25+00:00","rating":[3,2,4,3,5,2,4],"reason":"The article provides a critical perspective on German self-righteousness in the European battle over energy policy, highlighting instances where Germany has failed to listen to its European partners and pursued its own agenda without considering the broader implications.

But there have been no approvals or final decisions made.","textContent":"Bills that would allow the state’s two largest utilities to seek approval to charge customers for the costs of developing small modular nuclear reactors won final approval in the House of Delegates and Senate and are now headed to the governor.\nOn Thursday, floor amendments made Wednesday by the House to Sen. David Marsden’s SB 454 were approved by the Senate in a 26-14 vote. \nOriginally, Marsden’s bill had applied to both Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power. But Appalachian was removed because HB 1491, a similar bill introduced by Del. Israel O’Quinn, R-Washington County, that passed both chambers in February, covers Appalachian.\n[Disclosure: Dominion is one of our donors, but donors have no say in news decisions; see our policy.]\n“Now we have one for Dominion and one for Appalachian Power,” said Marsden, D-Fairfax County, who has said a number of times that he doesn’t believe the state can reach its clean energy goals without nuclear power and SMRs.\nOther states are ahead of Virginia with regard to SMR development and the commonwealth needs to get in line, he said.\nIn October 2022, Gov. Glenn Youngkin announced he planned to deploy a commercial SMR in Southwest Virginia within 10 years, as part of his “all-of-the-above” energy plan.\nAppalachian Power and Dominion have expressed an interest in building SMRs, and Dominion has included them in its long-range plans. But there have been no approvals or final decisions made.\nSMRs are smaller, simpler versions of traditional nuclear reactors and can be built in a factory and shipped to a site, which saves time, reduces the risks and is cheaper than constructing a large reactor.\nThere was some discussion Thursday before the vote. Sen. Creigh Deeds, D-Charlottesville, said the amendments make the bill stronger, but he questioned the costs that were discussed in the House on Wednesday. One of the amendments set a cap of $1.75 per month that could be charged to Dominion ratepayers, and there was mention of a total of about $250 million being collected.\nHowever, Deeds said he consulted the State Corporation Commission, which would have to approve any new charges by Dominion and Appalachian Power, and was told that the cap would mean ratepayers could be charged $500 million to $550 million over five years.\n“So, those of you who don’t like to impose additional costs on your taxpayers — with this bill, you are authorizing the State Corporation Commission to pass on half a billion dollars’ worth of costs without any guarantee of any electric power,” said Deeds, who voted against approving both the amendments and the original bill.\nThe other change made to the bill was that it will expire after five years.\nAaron Ruby, manager of media relations for Dominion, said Thursday that company officials are happy the legislation was approved.\n“SMRs are important for the clean energy transition,” he wrote in an email. “They’re carbon free and always reliable just like traditional nuclear, but cost less and have a smaller footprint. That’s good for our customers and good for the environment.”\nO’Quinn’s bill, which applies to Appalachian Power, would sunset after 10 years.\nHe said earlier that his bill would allow the utility to collect costs related to the early site permitting process. The bill states that those costs would include evaluation, design, engineering, environmental analysis and permitting, land options and early site permitting, but would not include the costs of obtaining permits, the cost of licenses required by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, or construction costs other than those necessary for early site permitting.\nAll approved costs would be recovered through a rate adjustment clause amortized over a period when the costs were incurred or five years, whichever is greater.\nAppalachian Power does not comment on legislation until the General Assembly session is complete and all bills have crossed the governor’s desk, according to spokesperson Teresa Hall. \nThe governor has 30 days from adjournment — which happens Saturday — to sign, veto or recommend changes to legislation. A bill becomes law if he doesn’t act by the deadline.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSusan Cameron is a reporter for Cardinal News.

The plant is a forest wild flower found in North America and called the Bunchberry dogwood.\nA few botanists had noted a strange “poof” associated with the plant, but no one knew what was going on. Researchers at Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts, were studying the plant when they experienced the “poof.” Wanting to track down what the plant was doing, they got a high-speed video camera that can shoot 1,000 frames per second. Amazingly, that camera was too slow to clearly catch what the plant was doing. So they got a higher-speed camera that could shoot 10,000 frames per second.\nWhen they reviewed the video, they discovered that the flower was releasing pollen at an amazing speed.

In 2022, Los Angeles voted in favor of a mansion tax to be levied on property owners who sold the most expensive, luxury properties in the city. The revenue from the tax was earmarked for public housing initiatives and social services.How Does The LA Mansion Tax WorkLike many cities, Los Angeles charges a tax on conveyances of real estate within city limits. The base tax rate for conveyances in Los Angeles is $2.25 for every $500 of the sale price. However, Los Angeles voted for a tax called Measure United to House LA (ULA), to raise additional money to combat the city's homelessness crisis.Measure ULA quickly became known as the mansion tax because it imposed a 4% tax on properties that sell for between $5 million and $10 million and a 5.5% tax on properties that sell for more than $10 million. This mansion tax would be applied in addition to the base rate of $2.25 per $500. On the surface, it seemed like a perfect idea.It would allow Los Angeles to raise badly needed funds to help remedy a pressing issue and only apply to a minuscule percentage of the city's real estate transactions.  Although Measure ULA does not apply to most Angelenos, like any tax, it is much less popular with the people who have to pay it than it is with people who don't.Don't Miss:Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100.Miami is expected to take New York's place as the U.S. Financial Capital. Here's how you can invest in the city with as little as $500 before that happens.First, They Sold Early To Beat The TaxIf death and taxes are the only two guarantees in life, it's also a guarantee that a subset of the population will resort to creative means to avoid paying those taxes. So it is that L.A.'s ultra-wealthy have found myriad ways around the mansion tax. First, there was a rush of mansions that were put on the market and sold before April 2023, when Measure ULA took effect.Many of Hollywood's biggest celebrities are suspected of having taken this route. One possible example is Mark Wahlberg, who sold his mansion for $55 million in February of 2023. By closing the deal before April, he saved himself a little over $3 million in Measure ULA taxes. Other mansion owners took their houses off the market and converted them to luxury short-term rentals.A New And Even More Ingenious Tax Avoidance StrategyThe latest gambits employed by wealthy property owners to avoid taxes under Measure ULA are equal parts cunning and simplistic. Imagine that you've been given a prototype Air Jordan shoe that was valuable but marked not for resale. You could theoretically sell an ordinary, and otherwise worthless, Michael Jordan bobblehead doll for $20,000 that came with a \"free\" pair of prototype Air Jordans as a bonus for the buyer.This is a simple way of explaining the shell game some people are playing to avoid the mansion tax. Some property owners have subdivided their $20 million mansions into four equal-sized lots of $4,999,999 each and sold all four lots to the same buyer. This is legal and because the transactions are for less than $5 million, they are only subject to the base tax rate on conveyances, not the mansion tax.Other property owners are selling their villas and mansions for $4,999,999, regardless of their size or value. Then they are cutting supplemental agreements, apart from the $4,999,999 purchase price, to sell the contents of the house, including art, furniture and fixtures, to the buyers for the same amount they took off the property's \"real\" sale price. By transferring property like this, they skirt the mansion tax.It's An Ugly RealityIt's hard not to be upset by this kind of legal chicanery. If you have enough money to buy or sell a property worth more than $5 million, you are on the \"have\" side of the have-and-have-not equation. That also means you likely have people around you whose job it is to look out for your best interests and save you money whenever possible.If you were selling your mansion and your accountant or tax lawyer said you could save millions of dollars in taxes with this perfectly legal shell game, would you pay the tax? It's an ugly reality but also a reminder that separating the wealthy from their wealth is difficult. Human nature is what it is, and no government has ever been able to change that.Read Next:Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin.

Participating in the Intergovernmental Negotiations on Security Council reform (IGN) on Thursday, India's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Ruchira Kamboj said the UN's 80th anniversary next year serves as a milestone to achieve concrete progress on the long-pending subject. Kamboj presented the 'G-4 model' on behalf of Brazil, Germany, Japan and India for debate, dialogue and finally negotiations. The proposals elicited strong support from wider UN members.

Catering to these new realities, the G4 model proposes that the Security Council's membership increase from the current 15 to 25-26, by adding six permanent and four or five non-permanent members. Among the six new permanent members, two each are proposed to be from African states and Asia Pacific states, one from Latin American and Caribbean states; and one from Western European and Other states. The G4 model notes that the current composition of the Security Council, with its \"glaring under-representation and un-representation\" of key regions in both categories of membership, is \"detrimental\" to its legitimacy and effectiveness. It stressed that the Council's inability to address critical conflicts and maintain international peace and security underscores the urgent need for reform. \"Any reform that does not address the lack of representation, particularly in the permanent category, would only exacerbate the current imbalances in the Council's composition and render it ill-equipped to address today's international challenges,\" she said. Kamboj highlighted that it is important to note that the G4 model \"does not specify\" which member states will occupy the new permanent seats. \"This decision will be made by the General Assembly in a democratic and inclusive election.\" She told the UN membership that the world has undergone a sea change since 1945 and the new realities need to be reflected in the permanent membership. \"Any proposal that does not address the issue of representation of the Global South, including Africa, Asia and Latin America, in the permanent category does a grave injustice to the aspirations of developing countries for equality.\" The G4 model offered flexibility on the veto, an issue that has been a contentious topic among member states as they try to move the needle forward on the reform process that has moved at a snail's pace over the years. \"While the new permanent members would, as a principle, have the same responsibilities and obligations as current permanent members, they shall not exercise the veto until a decision on the matter has been taken during a review,\" Kamboj said. \"Nonetheless, we should not allow the veto issue to have a \"veto\" over the process of Council reform itself. Our proposal is also a gesture of displaying flexibility on the issue for a constructive negotiation,\" she said. Currently, only the five permanent members - China, France, Russia, the UK and the US - hold veto powers and through its use have stalled action in the Council to address global challenges and conflicts such as in Ukraine and Gaza. The remaining 10 nations in the Council are elected to sit as non-permanent members for two-year terms and do not have veto powers. Highlighting the urgency for reform, Kamboj said the world and the future generations can wait no longer. The ambitious Summit of the Future scheduled to be held at the UN this September and the 80th anniversary of the United Nations next year are \"important milestones towards which we should aim to make concrete progress. We must push forward a reform heeding the voice of the young and future generations, including from Africa, where the demand to correct the historical injustices grows ever stronger. Otherwise, we simply risk sending the Council down the path of oblivion and irrelevance\". France's Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere said his country has long supported the candidacy of India, Japan, Brazil and Germany for permanent membership. \"In addition, France fully subscribes to the spirit of the model for comprehensive reform of the Security Council which has just been presented. It is in line with the strong expectations expressed by the vast majority of this Assembly,\" he said, responding to the G4 model. The US said it is clear that the strong majority of UN member states, including all 54 African countries, support expanding both permanent and non-permanent seats on the Security Council. \"For the Security Council to best derive the benefits of both categories, it is important that both the permanent and non-permanent membership be representative of the world as it is today, not the world as it existed in the wake of the Second World War.\"","length":5494,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T11:54:00+05:30","rating":[9,7,8,8,9,8,8],"reason":"The article provides detailed information on India's presentation of the G4 model for UNSC reform, highlighting key points such as new permanent members, democratic selection, flexibility on the veto issue, and the need for representation from key regions.

Rep. Greg Howard (R-Stonington), who is also an officer in Stonington, said legislation has to focus on preventing the large crowds from ever gathering.\n“When you have that many vehicles in an area and you take into account that police officers, largely, can’t chase these vehicles if they take off, enforcement is getting difficult,” he said.\nThe bill would allow municipalities to pass their own ordinances against takeovers and establish tougher penalties for people who participate in them.\nIt would also allow towns to destroy ATVs seized from takeovers. State law currently only allows towns to sell them at auction, but municipal leaders are reluctant to do that.\n“As you can imagine, we don’t these to just circulate back in the community, so we would like the tools to destroy them,” New Haven Mayor Justin Elicker said.\nThe bill also proposes making grants available to towns to help police takeovers.

FOXA1 functions as a pioneer TF to bind condensed chromatin and initiate the opening of local chromatin for gene expression. However, the principles of FOXA1 recruitment and how it subsequently unpacks the condensed chromatin remain elusive. Here, we revealed that FOXA1 intrinsically forms submicron-sized condensates through its N- and C-terminal intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Notably, both IDRs enable FOXA1 to dissolve the condensed chromatin. In addition, the DNA-binding capacity of FOXA1 contributes to its ability to both form condensates and dissolve condensed chromatin. Further genome-wide investigation showed that IDRs enable FOXA1 to bind and unpack the condensed chromatin to regulate the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells.

Welcome as the 2 per cent National Insurance cut and the change to child benefit rules are, overall the Budget does nothing to change our direction of travel towards a social democratic economy: high tax, high spend, big state, and hence low growth. It therefore also does nothing to improve Conservative electoral prospects. It is not then surprising, amid this world-weary acquiescence in collectivism, this stealing of Labour policy clothes, that we should find Jeremy Hunt referring approvingly to the NHS, and finding another £5-6 billion for it: small change, after all, in our health budget. He claimed that the NHS is “the biggest reason most of us are proud to be British” and unfortunately, according to the polling, he is right. An Ipsos Mori survey last year showed that, incredibly, 54 per cent of us put the NHS at the top of the list of reasons to be proud of being British, way ahead of our history, at 32 per cent, or our democracy, at 25 per cent. I say “incredibly” because most developed countries have a health system that is free at the point of use, too; most systems’ outcomes are better than ours; and satisfaction with ours is at historic lows. So the baffling centrality to British national identity of the NHS as an institution remains to be explained. It is easy to see why socialists like it. There is the Attlee and Nye Bevan mythology. There is the erasure from political history of all the (rather successful) pre-1948 arrangements for providing health care. There is the rhetorical emphasis on fairness and on equality – with queues and handouts as their necessary consequences, not phenomena that ever bother socialists very much. Behind it all, for the Labour Party, is a belief that, in an ideal world, the whole economy would be like the NHS, with market forces excluded and services allocated not bought. This is why Leftists like Jeremy Corbyn are obsessional about excluding any market transactions within the system: all cleaning, all car parking, all clothing provision must be done by the government for fear of contaminating the NHS’s moral purity. It is less obvious why so many Conservative politicians are believers in the NHS, or at least pretend to be. For one thing, you might hope they would reflect their voters. In that Mori poll, 71 per cent of 2019 Labour voters put the NHS at the top of their list, but only 31 per cent of Conservatives. It is also noticeable from that poll that older voters, who might be thought to have most experience of the health system, are significantly less proud of it. But it is a rare Conservative politician who will express any doubts about the health service and Jeremy Hunt certainly is not one of them. He has written a whole book about the NHS and his efforts to reduce avoidable harm and death within it – an astonishing 150 avoidable deaths every week. As he rightly says, solutions to this problem do exist – better accountability, better prevention, better technology. But he shows a touching belief in the ability of ministers and managers to make them happen, despite all the evidence that the problems just repeat and repeat. In truth, improvements are made despite the NHS system, not because of it. That’s not surprising in this Soviet-style set-up which has no competition, no real incentives, and no consumer power. If airlines kill their passengers, people stop flying on them, and their staff stop working for them. But if your local maternity centre kills too many babies, as all too many of them seem to keep on doing, you are stuck with it. Hunt proudly says that the NHS’s strength is that in it “we are always patients and never customers”. That, unfortunately, is precisely the issue. It would be more accurate to say that we are always patients and always paupers. When you walk across the threshold of an NHS institution, you become a pauper, at the mercy of those who run it, just as much as someone entering a Victorian workhouse. You must take the service you are given as and when the staff are ready to provide it. If you get good and kind treatment, as many do, you are lucky – which is why so many think it worthy of public comment. But you might not be lucky. If you need to change an appointment, but can’t contact the hospital: too bad. If you suffer while a GP receptionist decides whether you are a worthy “case”: too bad. And if you die on a waiting list: too bad. That mindset of we know best and you must put up with it is the true spirit of too many of those who govern Britain today – sadly, in all parties. Take what you are given and like it, and if things go wrong you’ll be taxed to pay for the mistakes. We see it in net zero, in immigration policy, in planning law, the Post Office scandal, and more. The NHS isn’t an anomaly within this system: it’s the apotheosis of it. That’s why it must change.","length":4957,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[3,2,4,3,4,3,2],"reason":"The article receives a low score in Accuracy as it contains factual inaccuracies and sweeping generalizations about the NHS and its operations.

Photo: Austin Ruffer\nIt’s billed as Fiasco Theater’s Pericles, not William Shakespeare’s, and there’s good reason for it. The Fiasco folks, together since 2009 and always mighty welcome, don’t mean to suggest they’re not presenting the Shakespeare play. They’re indicating they’re fooling around with it for their enjoyment and in turn for equal, if not more, audience enjoyment.\nScholars have rarely agreed that Shakespeare wrote the play himself — though with whom remains vague — and few deem it anywhere near classic Shakespeare. G. B. Harrison has claimed that Pericles is “far below his best’ and goes on to call earlier scenes as “puerile melodrama and so badly written that they might almost be parodies of Elizabethan drama at its worst.”\nHeigh ho, here come the Fiasco players not — take note of this — making fun of Pericles but making fun with it. At the jovial get-go, out the nine actors stroll in similar outfits (meant to resemble muslin?) and sandals. They sit in a circle on wooden boxes and begin to sing something director-songwriter-guitarist Ben Steinfeld has wrought, enhanced by Paul L. Coffey on cello.\nTruth to tell, this isn’t the first time the Fiasco members are seen. As the audience is entering, they’re spotted arranging the boxes. Some of them greet this or that one in the crowd. A few apparently spot friends whom they hug. It’s all in the spirit of establishing the informal approach to the material on hand.\nWhat is the plot of this rarely revived play? Pericles, prince of Tyre, travels to Antioch to win the princess’ hand. He wins it, but King Antiochus doesn’t want to confer it, which prompts the imperiled Pericles to steal away.  Whereupon he begins a lengthy journey around the Mediterranean that in more ways than one repeatedly leaves him all at sea.\nEventually, he marries Thaisa, and the temporarily happy couple brings infant Marina into the world. Thaisa meets a seemingly harsh end, though she actually becomes a nun. Marina grows up in a trice and is also rendered all at sea. Intended to be murdered and given out as deceased, she’s kidnapped by pirates, only to be sold to the highest bidder. She isn’t quite palmed off, but, after perils of her own, is reunited with the mourning Pericles and Thaisa so that the yet again happy family is no longer at sea.\nThis is Shakespeare in his Jacobean phase that includes The Winter’s Tale and The Tempest when the playwright was thinking about rebirth (cf. Hermione of The Winter’s Tale and the father-daughter bond (cf. Miranda of The Tempest). That’s when, nearing 50 and death at 52, he was focusing on the weighty oomph of redemption.\nSo how do the Fiasco troupers deal with all these trappings? You might call their directorial fiddling fiddle-shticks. Maybe the most refreshing is what they do with poor-put-upon Pericles. He’s played by not one, not two, not three Fiasco-ers but four: Noah Brody, Devin E. Haqq, Paco Tolson, and a sorta cross-dressing Tatiana Wechsler. The switch from Brody to Haqq has the latter moving behind the former, who then sidles behind the latter. Suave!\nThe company arranges it so that only one of them assumes a strictly single role. Director Steinfeld is troubadour-narrator Gower throughout, breaking into songs seemingly of his own devising, inspired by Shakespeare’s (or someone’s?) dialog.\nThe other eight chameleons — aided by costumer Ashley Rose Horton accessorizing — appear as several figures. Jess Austrian is Thaisa, both veiled when a nun and not when not. Coffey, Andy Grotelueschen, and Paco Tolson smoothly switch guises. All but Steinfeld appear as “and others” — you know, kidnapping pirates, et cetera.\nA special word goes out to Emily Young, who’s Marina and is handed a large chunk of the lengthy, increasingly serious denouement when the forlorn young woman must talk herself out of being sold into prostitution. She brings it off by way of several speeches during a long segment. In a  sequence that does impress as our Will Shakes at his quill, Marina’s twisting initially licentious Lysimachus (Tolson) around her finger is beautifully done. The same goes for the final father-daughter recognition-reconciliation, this time with Haqq as Pericles.\nReviewer’s recollection: I’ve only seen two previous Pericles productions, the first out of curiosity, the second out of duty. Subsequently, I intended to forego future opportunities. I was definitely reluctant to attend this one, until I reminded myself that the Fiasco bunch were likely to offer something appealingly off-kilter. Now I’d like to think that if I ever see another Pericles, it’s a revival of this nifty Fiasco rigmarole.\nPericles opened February 26, 2024, at the Classic Stage Company and runs through March 24.

Of course, an intense storyline means stronger villains, and the final saga has certainly given fans some of the most intriguing and dangerous villains in the form of the Five Elders.\n Related One Piece: What The Arrival Of The Gorosei On Egghead Means For The Straw Hats The rest of the Gorosei are summoned by Saturn in order to defeat Luffy in One Piece. \nThe Five Elders certainly are not new to the fans. These characters were first introduced long before the timeskip of the story. However, they are only now coming into play, and that means that these powerful individuals are going to have their moment to shine. Saint Saturn, one of the strongest characters in the entire story of One Piece, is playing an active part in the Egghead Island arc. He has displayed some incredible abilities to the fans over the last few chapters, but one that particularly stands out is his incredible regeneration factor. While this might look like a regular ability on the surface, there is some sinister secret behind it.\nSaint Saturn appeared as an antagonist and the Egghead Island arc and fans knew that he would play some sort of role in this story arc as soon as they saw him take part in the attack on Egghead with the Navy. Although Saturn did not want his identity known at first, when Kizaru started struggling on Egghead, he knew that he would have to jump into action and take things into his own hands. He did just that, and used the powers of a summoning circle to bring himself on Egghead. The Summoning Circle clearly looked demonic in nature, and the aura around it was certainly very malevolent as well. Saturn utilized this power to summon himself on Egghead, and just like a satanic ritual, he emerged from the circle, with giant flames and black lightning emerging from it.\nSaturn then went on to showcase his powers and battle, especially when he fought against the likes of the Straw Hat Pirates. Fans got to see all of his abilities. He could inflict injuries on others by merely looking at them. Even strong characters, such as Sanji or Luffy, were not able to see where this attack was coming from. His second ability was the power to hold people down in their place using some bizarre power. Thirdly, and most importantly, Saturn was shown to have an incredibly powerful regeneration factor. No matter what injury he was dealt, he was able to heal from it as if nothing happened in the first place.\nSaturn's regeneration factor was put on display on many occasions in the story, and the very first time fans got to see it fully was when Kuma landed a powerful blow on him. Kuma punched him right across the face and sent him flying across Egghead. Fans saw one of his horns break, and his entire facial structure get destroyed. He also lost his arm, by the looks of it when he was struck by this attack, however, and fans saw Saturn. Moments later, he appeared as if he wasn't even scratched, which was shocking. Fans also got to see more of Saturn regenerating later down the line. When the likes of Franky attacked him, and of course, when Luffy's Dawn Gatling blew him away, Saturn was seen regenerating again and again.\nThis was especially highlighted during his battle against Luffy. The Straw Hat Pirate was not able to harm him despite being in Gear 5, and clearly acknowledged the fact that Saturn's regeneration ability was incredibly annoying. No matter what Luffy did to him, he could not put him down, and this was a clear indication of the fact that something was unique about his regenerative powers.\nClearly, Saint Saturn is not alone when it comes to having these incredible regeneration powers. Fans know the Five Elders to hold unique Devil Fruit abilities which resemble monstrous creatures. This was confirmed in the Reverie arc, and it will certainly be put on display in One Piece chapter 1110 as well. As such, it shouldn't be a surprise for the fans to see all the other members of the Five Elders hold similar regeneration powers as well.\n Related One Piece: Luffy Vs All Five Elders, Explained Luffy takes on the Five Elders in One Piece's next chapter. \nThis is especially true because the nature of the powers of these Elders is very similar. For instance, all of them emerge from big giant summoning circles with massive flames and black lightning emerging from them. All of them hold the power to communicate telepathically with each other, and, similarly, all of them will most certainly hold the regeneration power that Saturn has as well. It is a fair assumption to say that Saturn has everything that all the other Elders have as well, and that these powerful individuals have something more deep than just Devil Fruit abilities up their sleeve.\nThe very first thing that one might consider when thinking of the regeneration factor of Saturn and the Five Elders is, of course, their Devil Fruit ability. Most Zoan Devil Fruits have a powerful regeneration factor associated with them. For instance, Zoans are known to be the best at close-range combat. They have a higher attack power, and, at the same time, a higher recovery rate as well. However, no Zoan fruit user can actually regenerate. That said, specific Zoan powers can have the ability to regenerate. This is especially true in the case of Mythical Zoan Devil Fruits.\nMythical Zoans are known to have unique abilities associated with them. It is possible that in the case of the Devil Fruit of Saturn and the other Five Elders, this unique power is the ability to regenerate. While this is a possible theory, it wouldn't make sense for all five of them to have this same power, given that all of them have a different ability.\nOne can also consider the idea that the Five Elders have an entirely different subclass of Zoan Devil Fruits. While Zoans are categorized into Ancient and Mythical Zoans, apart from the normal ones, it is possible that the Five Elders have Zoan Devil Fruits that belong to an entirely different subclass that has never been heard before. This wouldn't be completely out of the ordinary. Oda did something similar with the Paramecia Devil Fruit class in Whole Cake Island, when he gave Katakuri the Special Paramecia. For the Five Elders to have a special class, especially since they are the most exalted of all people in the One Piece world shouldn't be surprising at all. It would then explain why their Devil Fruits have unique powers that no other fruit has shown in One Piece.\nThere is also a prevalent idea that the Five Elders are actually satellites, similar to how Vegapunk has his own satellites created by Stella. According to this idea, the Five Elders are satellites created by Imu, and all the abilities that they show are Imu's very own. In this case, the regeneration power will then belong to Imu, however, there are quite a few holes in this idea, which make it less likely. The regeneration ability is not normal, and is certainly tied to a concept that fans do not know about just yet, but they most likely stem from the Devil Fruit-like ability that the Elders have.\nOne Piece is available to read via Viz Media. The series can be read by the fans officially and for free on the Shonen Jump and the Manga Plus app. The release date for the next chapter of One Piece, One Piece 1110, is set to be March 17, 2024.\n One Piece Studio Toei Animation Story By Eiichiro Oda Number of Episodes 1082+ \n More One Piece: Why The Five Elders Might Not Be Devil Fruit Users The Five Elders from One Piece might not be Devil Fruit users after all.","length":9883,"publishedTime":"2024-03-05T23:31:13Z","rating":[4,4,6,5,7,5,6],"reason":"The article provides information about the regeneration power of Saint Saturn and the Five Elders in the One Piece series, with a focus on the current storyline.

Then there is a federal goal to have 1.2 million tech-related jobs by 2030. \nThis comes amid a growing discussion about how the current STEM workforce tends to be white and male. \nLast month’s Diversity in STEM Review noted how in 2021, only 36% of STEM university students identified as female, while only 5% were living with a disability. In the same year, 0.5% of Indigenous peoples held a university STEM qualification, compared to 4.9% of the Australian population. \nWe recently conducted research for the diversity review about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples’ views on STEM. This included how we can increase the use of Indigenous STEM knowledge, as well as grow the number of Indigenous peoples in STEM. \nIndigenous STEM knowledge is vast and includes many things such as astronomy, weather knowledge, medicinal plant knowledge and animal classification systems. \n First Peoples' knowledge of 'mysterious fairy circles' in Australian deserts has upended a long-standing science debate\nIn 2023, we did an online survey of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults’ views on STEM. This is the largest survey of its kind. \nWe asked both multiple choice and open-ended questions and received 204 responses from diverse Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, representing 98 different mobs across the nation. \nWe did this as part of a broader body of work for the Diversity in STEM review. We also did literature reviews, case studies and interviews on Indigenous contributions to STEM and barriers to participating.\nAlmost one quarter (23%) of our respondents had not heard the term “STEM”. This needs to change if we want to increase Indigenous participation in STEM. It is difficult to promote STEM opportunities to our communities if terminology and language aren’t relatable or understood well.\nOf those surveyed, 83.3% saw a connection between STEM and Indigenous culture. This also came up in the literature reviews and qualitative interviews we did: western ideas of STEM and Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing should not be seen as separate, but as complimentary. \nAlmost everyone surveyed (98%) believed it was important to have Indigenous people represented in STEM fields. Having Indigenous role models in STEM is critical if we hope more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples will pursue these careers: we must be able to see a place for ourselves in these fields.\nI think it’s important that as an Indigenous person growing up you can see other people in STEM fields so you are aware of the opportunities you have.\nAlmost all (97.5%) of respondents either strongly agreed or agreed STEM could benefit community. Many mob have strong motivations to give back and this finding can be used in designing policies and programs that incorporate the connections between STEM and community.\nOnly one in three participants felt Indigenous people are being supported to pursue STEM careers. \nThey said racism, discrimination and individual and financial challenges are all barriers. Some of the individual barriers identified are a lack of support, opportunities or confidence.\nWe are often told we are not good enough or smart enough to pursue STEM because we don’t fit certain moulds of what people think should be STEM people.\nOne participant observed the way STEM is talked about and defined is also an issue:\n How many surveyed Indigenous people feel they are supported to pursue STEM careers?\nWe know there are Indigenous people who are thriving in their STEM careers, despite the challenges. There is also enormous positivity about the possibilities of STEM for individual careers and for Indigenous communities more broadly. As one survey respondent told us: \nI believe STEM can provide more opportunities for our future generations in education, cultural equality and industry advancement.\nOne person elaborated on the possibilities for sustaining Country and communities:\nProtecting Country and community both require STEM skills and are necessary in supporting our future generations.\nBut our respondents noted it was essential to listen to Indigenous peoples. Our voices need to be at the centre of decision making moving forward. As one participant said: \nthe more involvement and engagement we have, the more it opens the door for future generations.\n How many surveyed Indigenous people see a connected between STEM and their culture?\n Universities Accord: there's a push to increase Indigenous students and voices in higher education. But we need more detail and funding\nOur final report outlines 22 key findings and 15 recommendations based on our research. This is both evidence-based and Indigenous-informed. This is important, as our research found most published research to date on Indigenous participation in STEM and Indigenous STEM knowledge has been undertaken by non-Indigenous researchers.\nA place to advance Indigenous STEM knowledges: This should include a platform for schools and universities to access quality sources on Indigenous STEM knowledges and knowledge holders, as well as investment to grow the Indigenous STEM research workforce.\nA campaign to increase Indigenous peoples’ awareness about STEM: This should include what STEM is, as well as opportunities to be involved. It should also break down language barriers (by being published in multiple languages) and be Indigenous-led.\nEstablish an Office for Indigenous STEM: This would coordinate and promote policy initiatives from governments to increase Indigenous participation in STEM and would be similar to the existing Office for Women in STEM.\nCommunity-based STEM programs: To date, governments have invested in many programs but few of these are community based or use existing STEM knowledge within communities.\nAlign Indigenous STEM goals with broader Indigenous education policies: Unless education outcomes improve for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, increasing Indigenous participation in STEM will be challenging.\nInclude STEM perspectives in early childhood programs: this will provide opportunities to experience STEM from an early age, including Indigenous perspectives on STEM. \nThe authors acknowledge the rest of the Big Mob: STEM It Up research team: Suraiya Abdul Hameed, Pedram Rashidi, Zoe Ockerby, Amanda Hurley, Lisa Harvey-Smith and Lisa Williams.","length":7513,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,8,7,8,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides well-researched information on the challenges and opportunities for Indigenous participation in STEM fields.

With his bold personality, O'Malley has drawn attention from peers across various disciplines, including boxing, where Ryan Garcia has emerged as a vocal contender for a potential matchup with O'Malley.Garcia recently stirred the pot by publicly challenging O'Malley to a fight inside the octagon, claiming he would \"destroy\"O'Malley. However, the exchange quickly took a concerning turn as Garcia's behavior became increasingly erratic and alarming.During a recent social media rant, Garcia made outlandish claims and expressed bizarre beliefs, including allegations of being tied up and forced to witness heinous acts and assertions about the existence of aliens and secret societies.Commenting on the situation surrounding Garcia, O'Malley expressed sympathy, stating, \"Cocaine's a hell of a drug. I think he's on drugs and he's acting a fool. [I] feel bad for him more than anything, you know?\" O'Malley emphasized that he wishes Garcia well and hopes for his recovery.O'Malley shuts down potential fight against GarciaWhen asked about the possibility of a crossover MMA fight with Garcia, O'Malley remained realistic, acknowledging the unlikelihood of such an event while expressing openness to the idea.\"Yeah, that will never happen, and if it does, I'm here for it. It wouldn't be my fault that fight doesn't happen. So, yeah. Realistically, that will never happen.\"Meanwhile, concerns about Garcia's well-being have escalated among fans and supporters. With just one month remaining until his highly anticipated fight against Devin Haney, Garcia's recent behavior has raised doubts about his mental and emotional state. Despite his reassurances to the contrary, speculation about drug use persists.As Garcia prepares for his upcoming bout, the focus remains on his ability to maintain his physical and mental health.

All that's visible of them are their teenage faces, swathed in black hijabs. They were around 15 and 16 years old respectively when the young Tunisian women became involved with the Islamic State group (IS), which is categorised as a terrorist group by the British government (among others). Their fate, the documentary director Kaouther Ben Hania tells the viewer, was \"to be devoured by the wolf\" – a reference to the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood.\nMore like this:-          The Oscar nominee wading into the US culture wars-          The Ukraine documentary up for an Oscar-          Why Anatomy of a Fall's argument went viral\nFour Daughters has garnered Tunisian filmmaker Ben Hania her second Oscar nomination, this time in the documentary category (her first was in the international film category in 2021 for the drama The Man Who Sold His Skin, about a Syrian refugee who sells himself for art in return for a Schengen visa). In Four Daughters, the story of Ghofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui, their younger sisters Eya and Tayssir and their mother Olfa, is told through remembering the events that led to the older sisters joining IS. It reveals a fascinating and disturbing history of generational female trauma, intertwined with the history of Tunisia itself.To begin with, Ben Hania says, she was interested by what might motivate a young woman to join group like IS. \"We're used to men doing this and it's quite new that women are also involved with terrorism. I think I wanted to understand why young women are attracted to this,\" she tells BBC Culture. \"One of the ideas that I found very counterintuitive is that Ghofrane and Rahma were looking for freedom. They wanted to break free from the oppression of their mother. They wanted to prove to their mother and to their father that they were worthy. So, it's mind-blowing for me to understand that a desire for freedom and for another horizon can lead you there.\"\nThere are many photos of young women like the Chikhaoui sisters, who ran away to join IS during the height of the group's acts of terror and occupation. A 2018 report from King's College London estimated that 4,761 female foreign citizens were linked to IS activities in Iraq and Syria between 2013 and 2018.You have the headlines, but what's behind the headlines? For this, you need time, and that's why you have cinema – Kaouther Ben HaniaLike Ben Hania, the media is also interested in the idea of the female terrorist – and those who join such groups can be judged as harshly as their male peers. A London teenager, Shamima Begum, who joined IS as a 15-year-old, was recently stripped of her British citizenship, although her lawyers had appealed on the basis that she had been groomed by IS. \"You have the headlines,\" Ben Hania says. \"But what's behind the headlines? For this, you need time, and that's why you have cinema.\"\nWhat's memorable about Four Daughters is the way Ben Hania gets to the root of why the Chikhaoui sisters made these choices. As well as asking the girls' mother, Olfa Hamrouni, to participate, and the two younger daughters, the director asked two actresses, Ichrak Matar and Nour Karoui, to play the parts of Ghofrane and Rahma, and Tunisian-Egyptian star Hend Sabry to play Olfa when memories might become too distressing for her. One Tunisian actor, Majd Mastoura, plays all the male characters, a dramatic device adopted to let the female characters stand out. \nA tragic cycle of abuse Ben Hania stresses the film isn't a docudrama or reminiscent of a documentary such as Joshua Oppenheimer's 2012 Oscar-nominated The Act of Killing, which asked former Indonesian death-squad leaders to re-enact their crimes. \"Despite the fact you have actors, the acting parts are very small in the film and the actors are acting as a person, they're sharing their thoughts and their questions with Olfa and her two daughters. Maybe we can call it a meta documentary because it's a movie about a movie being done about actors and real characters,\" she suggests.\n\"I started by shooting a fly-on-the-wall documentary, but I quickly realised that it wasn't interesting, I need more to dig deep into this story, so I borrowed tools from fiction, from cinema mainly, to go further and to tell this story in a better, deeper way. \"I brought actors to Olfa and to the two youngest daughters, the real characters, so they can direct the actors to remember their memories and what happened. It's a dialogue, you see, between actor and real character. It's the story of transmission, from mother to daughter, transmission of violence, and what the mother calls 'malediction'.\"Ben Hania asked the girls' mother Olfa Hamrouni to participate, with Tunisian-Egyptian star Hend Sabry taking her part at points (Credit: Twenty Twenty Vision)What's apparent from the film is that Olfa Hamrouni suffered abuse as a young woman, recalling that as a teenager she tried to protect her own mother and sisters from sexual violence, hitting out herself. When she married her daughters' father, she recalls her own sister urging the bridegroom to treat Olfa roughly to get the marriage consummation over and done with. But Olfa punched the groom and used that blood to stain the sheets that were supposed to signify that sex had taken place. Later Olfa, now bringing up her daughters alone, would become violent with her girls, out of fear that they would become what's referred to in the film as \"sluts\"; when Ghofrane dyed her hair and shaved her legs, Olfa recalls beating her. By the end of the film, Olfa tells Kaouther Ben Hania that she is like the cat, \"who out of fear for her babies, eats them. I was so afraid for them, I was unable to protect them. I didn't eat them, but I lost them\".\n\"Olfa refers to this generational cycle in the film as 'the curse',\" Ben Hania explains. \"So, what she went through as a child and teenager, she did exactly the same to her daughters. She understood during the movie what was happening with her and how this inheritance of trauma affected her daughters also. But what is great is that at one point the actors also tell her, 'We all do this. We transfer to our daughters what we inherit from our mothers, and then we finally arrive at the generation that says, stop. We don't want this anymore.' The eldest daughters had a very violent reaction and said no to this cycle, and maybe the two youngest will be saved. They're the hope in this film.\"I think what radicalisation at least offered them is they could reverse the power dynamic with their mother – Ben HaniaPerhaps what partly motivated Ghofrane and Rahma to first wear hijabs and then niqabs (which, according to the film, were rarely used in public before the 2011 Tunisian Revolution) was to seek safety from their mother, but as they became radicalised further, Ben Hania suggests it was a way of them asserting authority over her. \"I think what radicalisation at least offered them is they could reverse the power dynamic with their mother. They can lecture their mother, they can lecture the people lecturing them about their sexuality,\" she points out.\n\"I think that what is paradoxical in this story, is that the patriarchy is not all the men played by Majd Mastoura, but that someone like Olfa was the guardian of the patriarchy. She was the one putting pressure on her daughters. And since they were beautiful girls, they almost had to refute that they'd turn bad or become 'sluts', as it's said in the movie. When you have this perpetual accusation, because you are women, you have to find a way to defend yourself.\"Kaouther Ben Hania's Four Daughters won best documentary at the recent Spirit Awards and is up for an Oscar (Credit: Getty Images)Ben Hania agrees that Ghofrane and Rahma were also teenagers during a period that was ripe for them to be radicalised. After the instability of the Tunisian Revolution in 2011 and the rise of the Islamic State group, many Tunisians became attracted by the idea of joining the group in Libya, Iraq or Syria. Up to 6,000 Tunisians were estimated to have joined IS by 2015. \"I think about that quote from Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci, that 'the old world is dying, the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters,'\" she says.\n\"He was talking about Europe between two worlds, but it could be said too about the Arab Spring and the rise of Islamic State. In the twilight, you have monsters. The Revolution, the Arab Spring, shook the dictatorships in the region, but also the new world, the fruit of this revolution, freedom and democracy, they weren't there yet. So, you have all these monsters playing while the new world is late to arrive. Olfa's daughters were in this place with monsters.\"\nGhofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui's names made headlines in Tunisia in 2015 when it emerged that they had joined IS; Olfa would also appear on Tunisian television saying that she'd warned the authorities that that her daughters were being radicalised (she had even requested that they'd lock Rahma up, to prevent her from running away.) They would later be captured in Libya, and in 2023 were sentenced to 16 years in prison. Ghofrane's eight-year-old daughter Fatma is growing up in a Libyan prison with her mother.\nBen Hania reports that her film is still playing in cinemas in Tunisia, nearly six months after its release. However, plans to either allow the sisters to come and stand trial in Tunisia, or to allow Fatma to leave prison, have so far not been successful. Perhaps most moving in Four Daughters, which sums up the history of family trauma revealed by the documentary, is when Eya Chikhaoui is asked what she'd say to her sisters if she could see them again.\n\"This family that has destroyed you, I won't let it destroy me,\" she says.\nFour Daughters is on release now; the Academy Awards take place on 10 March 2024.\nIf you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.;","length":10453,"publishedTime":"2024-03-04T11:00:00Z","rating":[8,9,8,7,8,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the documentary \"Four Daughters\" and the story of Ghofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui.

After their plan backfires, Max has both her arms and her legs broken and is blinded in the process. Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) manages to revive Max with her abilities, but she remains in a coma at Hawkins Hospital at the end of the finale. Stranger Things showrunners the Duffer Brothers have confirmed Max's fate as of the events of Season 4, describing her as \"brain-dead and blind\" in an interview on the Happy Sad Confused podcast. However, this obviously isn’t the end for this beloved character, and what's in store for her is still up in the air. All of her limbs may be broken, and she may be blind, but she is not helpless, and she may not even be useless in the show's final season. In fact, Max could play one of the most important roles in the battle to save Hawkins if the series decides to go in this direction with her character.\n Stranger Things When a young boy vanishes, a small town uncovers a mystery involving secret experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one strange little girl. \nAccording to the series, Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard) is the group's Dungeon Master who is the \"heart\" and leader of the party and is responsible for narrating the campaign, as well as a Paladin. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) is a Wizard, \"Will the Wise\" as well as a Cleric, or a magic user. Meanwhile, Dustin Henderson (Gaten Matarazzo) is a Dwarf, \"Nog,\" and a Bard; Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin) is a Knight, \"Sundar the Bold,\" and a Ranger; and Eleven is a Mage. Everyone has clear, established roles, courtesy of the prior seasons, except for one character. Max does suggest that she could be the party's Zoomer in Season 3, but a Zoomer is not technically a class in Dungeons & Dragons, as the boys point out. In D&D, however, a player does not choose to become the Oracle, but rather, one is chosen by some mysterious power. Oracles have the power to contact the gods and ask for guidance; they can also see glimpses into the future. This divine gift comes at a great cost, and the player’s character, who becomes the Oracle, will suffer a terrible curse. Sound familiar?\nIn terms of being able to assist the rest of the group, there's still a possibility for Max to help even while confined to a hospital bed: she could be a mole for the others if her consciousness is trapped in Vecna's mind in the Upside Down. Consider the likelihood that Vecna is gravely injured and recovering in the wake of Season 4's massive battle; he may not even be aware that Max is close at hand. Or the opposite could happen, and Vecna could use Max to spy on the party, as he did with Will in Season 2. Max could see into the Upside Down and tell Eleven telepathically what Vecna's plans are once the two possibly make contact in the Void (the black empty space Eleven sees when she's in a sensory deprivation tank).\nStranger Things' many '80s references are what make the show so iconic, including classic films like The Goonies, E.T., and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, as well as Hellraiser and Nightmare on Elm Street in the most recent season. Along those same lines, an Oracle would be another homage to everything Stranger Things is already paying tribute to. Oracles are pivotal in several science fiction and fantasy series from that time period, including DC Comics' Barbara Gordon, who adopted the moniker of Oracle after being shot by the Joker in The Killing Joke, which incapacitated her much in the same way Max has been. Beyond the fact that Max has yet to find her contributing role to the main group, the blinding injury she sustained also makes her the perfect candidate to become the show's new Oracle. Max has already proven how intelligent she is by surviving Vecna's wrath time and time again. It's entirely plausible that Max could gain the ability to see into the future — a major trait Oracles possess — while she's trapped in Vecna's mind and has the potential to draw on his existing power.\n To Complete Her Arc, Max Needs to Get Revenge in 'Stranger Things' Season 5 \nMax has had one of the most complex and compelling arcs in Stranger Things — plummeting into a deep depressive state as she struggled with overcoming grief and shame at the beginning of Season 4, which made her the perfect victim of Vecna's curse. In order for her arc to end in a satisfying way, she needs to learn to let go of her guilt and forgive herself, overcome her trauma of losing her brother, Billy (Dacre Montgomery), and find the strength to defeat her metaphorical demons, who take the physical form of Vecna. The only way she can do that is by killing Vecna before he kills her. Vecna has to kill Max in order to claim four lives, thereby making it possible for him to destroy the world, and as a result, Hawkins remains in limbo between our world and the Upside Down while Max is still in her coma. Although she'll still be in danger and a target in the show's concluding season, she could also become one of Stranger Things' most powerful and essential characters as the final battle looms.\nStranger Things is available to stream on Netflix in the U.S.","length":6957,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T03:00:13Z","rating":[7,6,8,6,7,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information regarding the events of Stranger Things Season 4 and explores the potential pivotal role of the character Max in Season 5.

Since the update is only a day away from its scheduled launch, the community is wondering whether they should summon these two new characters.\nA quick overview of <Ceremony> Charlotte and Magna tells you that they are very powerful. However, since the Black Clover M Season 5 trailers showed glimpses of the Witch Queen, and rumors about Mereoleona's launch on the global server are growing strong, this is a crucial crossroads for players.\nShould you pull for <Ceremony> Charlotte in Black Clover M Season 5?\nCeremony Charlotte has an amazing design in Black Clover M Season 5 (Image via Vic Game Studio)\n<Ceremony> Charlotte in Black Clover M Season 5 is among the most-awaited releases in the title. The green supporter champion has 120 speed without Dupes, which brings her among the top five units in that regard.\nCharlotte’s first skill grants [SP +1] buffs to allies with the highest ATK stat. Her first skill’s ATK and MATK percentages are at 80. However, they increase up to 100% when the skill is upgraded to level five.\nCharlotte’s second skill will give [SP +2] to a designated ally, which can increase to three when combined with the first skill. She also grants allies a [Debuff Immunity] for one turn. There is a 40% chance to reduce Charlotte’s second skill’s cooldown by one turn as well. However, once it is upgraded to level five, the probability of this happening increases to 100%. So, this is among the best skills of the unit.\nCharlotte’s ultimate grants all allies a 30% [Reduced DMG Taken] and a [DEF PEN Lv. 3] to the ally with the highest ATK for two turn(s). Furthermore, if the ally has a [Barrier], it also grants an [Extend Barrier Duration by one turn(s)] Buff. The [Reduced DMG Taken] can increase to 54% at ultimate skill level five.\nSo the unit provides amazing support for allies with her skills one and two. Besides, her ultimate makes her a perfect suit for characters like William, another top-tier character in the current meta-tier list.\nCharlotte’s Combined Attack deals up to 85% ATK and MATK to the enemy at level five and also grants the partnered mage 100% of their own Max HP as a [Barrier] for two turn(s) before attacking.\nOnce you implement the LR +2 Dupe, it will grant the ally with the highest All ATK a [Barrier] equal to 50% of its own Max HP for two turn(s). However, when you use LR +5, each turn will grant an ally with the highest All ATK a [Barrier] equal to 50% of their own Max HP for two turn(s) and grant self [Taunt Immunity].\nAll things considered, pulling for <Ceremony> Charlotte from Black Clover M Season 5 can be incredibly helpful for players all over the world.\nShould you pull for <Ceremony> Magna in Black Clover M Season 5?\nMagna also has a unique design in Black Clover M Season 5 (Image via Vic Game Studio)\nOn the other hand, <Ceremony> Magna is a Red Attacker in Black Clover M Season 5 who can deal immense damage. However, unfortunately for fans, since Gear Transcendence is arriving in this patch in Black Clover M Season 5, it makes him an average unit at best.\nSince Gear Transcendence adds extra stats to every gear, every champion becomes a little more powerful. Magna is an attacking unit but his defensive stats are low, so it will be hard for him to outlive the champions in the game.\nMagna’s skills one and two are pretty similar. If the enemy is suffering from [Burn] damage, Magna inflicts extra [Burn] damage for two turn(s). It also inflicts [Burn] on the enemy, dealing constant damage for two turn(s). While his skill two has the same effects, it can be enhanced with the signature Skill Page, after which it inflicts [Block HP Recovery] on an enemy for two turn(s).\nFor every instance of continuous [Burn] damage an enemy is taking, Magna’s ultimate grants an [Increased DMG Dealt] buff. Furthermore, it grants an [Extra Turn] upon killing an enemy. So you would mostly try to finish enemies with his ultimate and inflict [Burn] on the next turn.\nHowever, since Magna has very low defensive stats, you will have to get at least two Dupes for him since LR +2 inflicts [Stun] status ailment for one turn(s) upon an enemy taking continuous [Burn] damage. Besides, his LR +5 helps him get [Stun Immunity] permanently as well.\nSince a defensive unit like Black Asta is already there in the global server, Magna can become useless despite his vast damage-dealing skills. Therefore, it may not be worth wasting pulls on him, given that top-tier characters like Mereoleona, Witch Queen, and others will soon enter the meta, and you will need to save for them too.\nFollow for more Black Clover M-related articlesHow to reroll in Black Clover M || Black Asta build in Black Clover M || Black Clover Mobile tier list for March 2024","length":4875,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T04:30:43+00:00","rating":[7,8,7,5,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides factual information about the abilities and skills of <Ceremony> Charlotte and Magna in Black Clover M Season 5, along with details on their potential impact on gameplay.

Now, it’s chasing a different clientele: precious metal investors and collectors.","textContent":"Costco locked in $1.50 hot dog-soda loyalists. Now, it’s chasing a different clientele: precious metal investors and collectors.\n Costco recently started selling silver coins for the first time, finance chief Richard Galanti told CNN.\n The company is selling 25-count tubes of 1 oz. Canada Maple Leaf Silver Coins online for $675. The front of the coins features a maple leaf, and King Charles III is on the back. The coins are non-refundable, and members can purchase a maximum of five.\n Costco is trying to replicate its recent success with gold bars. It began selling $2,000 gold bars online in September and sold more than $100 million worth of the bars last quarter.\n But Costco’s move is more about marketing than just about increasing sales. After all, not many people are actually stashing away gold bars in their homes.\n It’s selling precious metals to try to reinforce its “treasure hunt” brand image where it peppers its stores with unexpected, limited-time items to keep shoppers coming back.\n “We try to create an attitude that, if you see it, you ought to buy it because chances are it ain’t going to be there next time,” Costco’s founder once said. “That’s the treasure-hunt aspect. We constantly buy that stuff and intentionally run out of it from time to time.”\n Costco is also selling precious metals as they become more valuable. Gold prices have notched record highs this week. Silver futures are up 21% in the past year.\n Precious metal prices have gone up because investors are betting that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in the back half of the year.\n Gold and silver are considered to be one of the most resilient investments. When interest rates fall, holding income-paying assets (like bonds) becomes less appealing than owning the precious metals. When interest rates are low, falling or — as in this case — expected to fall, demand for Treasury bonds ebbs, and precious metals, which don’t pay out any interest, become relatively more attractive.\n Some investors also believe them to be a hedge against inflation, wagering that they will hold their value even if it begins to surge, even though metals face price fluctuations like any other commodity.\n Costco’s success in selling the metals comes as the company continues to report strong profits from the pandemic in 2020, when customers rushed to stores to load up on groceries and household staples. Millions of first-time customers signed up for club memberships during the pandemic and have held on to them, pushing Costco’s member rolls to all-time highs.\n Shares of Costco (COST) have rallied 60% over the past year.\n Costco reported quarterly earnings Thursday. The company’s sales at stores open for at least one year increased 5.6%, but fell short of analyst forecasts.\n Costco said inflation was roughly flat during the quarter, which allowed it to reduce prices on some items.\n Galanti told analysts on a call Thursday that Costco cut reading glasses, for example, from $18.99 to $16.99 and cut a 48-count of batteries from $17.99 to $15.99.","length":3500,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T17:32:44.485Z","rating":[6,7,8,6,8,7,6],"reason":"- Accuracy: The article provides factual information about Costco's recent introduction of selling silver coins and gold bars, the pricing details, the reasons behind this move, and the market trends of precious metals.\r\n    - Objectivity: The article presents a balanced perspective on Costco's strategy in selling precious metals, highlighting both the marketing aspect and the market trends influencing the decision.\r\n    - Clarity and Coherence: The article is well-structured and organized, with clear explanations of Costco's actions and the factors affecting precious metal prices.\r\n    - Depth of Analysis: The analysis of Costco's decision to sell precious metals, the market trends, and the impact on investors is moderately informative but lacks in-depth insights.\r\n    - Language and Presentation: The language used is appropriate, the writing is engaging, and there are no significant issues with grammar, spelling, or formatting.\r\n    - Readability: The article is easy to comprehend, with suitable sentence structures and coherence.\r\n    - Attractive: The article maintains reader interest through clear explanations and insights into Costco's strategy, but it could benefit from more engaging storytelling elements.","conclusion":"1"},{"lang":"en","siteName":"Aeon Magazine","link":"https://aeon.co/ideas/philosophy-can-make-the-previously-unthinkable-thinkable","title":"Philosophy can make the previously unthinkable thinkable | Aeon Ideas","byline":"Rebecca Brown","excerpt":"Philosophy, public debate and the ‘Overton window’: on the ethics of making previously unthinkable ideas become mainstream","textContent":"Detail from Woman at a Window (1822) by Caspar David Friedrich. Courtesy Alte Nationalgalerie, BerlinIn the mid-1990s, Joseph Overton, a researcher at the US think tank the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, proposed the idea of a ‘window’ of socially acceptable policies within any given domain. This came to be known as the Overton window of political possibilities. The job of think tanks, Overton proposed, was not directly to advocate particular policies, but to shift the window of possibilities so that previously unthinkable policy ideas – those shocking to the sensibilities of the time – become mainstream and part of the debate.\nOverton’s insight was that there is little point advocating policies that are publicly unacceptable, since (almost) no politician will support them. Efforts are better spent, he argued, in shifting the debate so that such policies seem less radical and become more likely to receive support from sympathetic politicians. For instance, working to increase awareness of climate change might make future proposals to restrict the use of diesel cars more palatable, and ultimately more effective, than directly lobbying for a ban on such vehicles.\nOverton was concerned with the activities of think tanks, but philosophers and practical ethicists might gain something from considering the Overton window. By its nature, practical ethics typically addresses controversial, politically sensitive topics. It is the job of philosophers to engage in ‘conceptual hygiene’ or, as the late British philosopher Mary Midgley described it, ‘philosophical plumbing’: clarifying and streamlining, diagnosing unjustified assertions and pointing out circularities.\nHence, philosophers can be eager to apply their skills to new subjects. This can provoke frustration from those embedded within a particular subject. Sometimes, this is deserved: philosophers can be naive in contributing their thoughts to complex areas with which they lack the kind of familiarity that requires time and immersion. But such an outside perspective can also be useful. Although such contributions will rarely get everything right, the standard is too demanding in areas of great division and debate (such as practical ethics). Instead, we should expect philosophers to offer a counterpoint to received wisdom, established norms and doctrinal prejudice.\nEthicists, at least within their academic work, are encouraged to be skeptical of intuition and the naturalistic fallacy (the idea that values can be derived simply from facts). Philosophers are also familiar with tools such as thought experiments: hypothetical and contrived descriptions of events that can be useful for clarifying particular intuitions or the implications of a philosophical claim. These two factors make it unsurprising that philosophers often publicly adopt positions that are unintuitive and outside mainstream thought, and that they might not personally endorse.\nThis can serve to shift, and perhaps widen, the Overton window. Is this a good thing? Sometimes philosophers argue for conclusions far outside the domain of ‘respectable’ positions; conclusions that could be hijacked by those with intolerant, racist, sexist or fundamentalist beliefs to support their stance. It is understandable that those who are threatened by such beliefs want any argument that might conceivably support them to be absent from the debate, off the table, and ignored.\nHowever, the freedom to test the limits of argumentation and intuition is vital to philosophical practice. There are sufficient and familiar examples of historical orthodoxies that have been overturned – women’s right to vote; the abolition of slavery; the decriminalisation of same-sex relationships – to establish that strength and pervasiveness of a belief indicate neither truth nor immutability.\nIt can be tedious to repeatedly debate women’s role in the workforce, abortion, animals’ capacity to feel pain and so on, but to silence discussion would be far worse. Genuine attempts to resolve difficult ethical dilemmas must recognise that understanding develops by getting things wrong and having this pointed out. Most (arguably, all) science fails to describe or predict how the world works with perfect accuracy. But as a collective enterprise, it can identify errors and gradually approximate ‘truth’. Ethical truths are less easy to come by, and a different methodology is required in seeking out satisfactory approximations. But part of this model requires allowing plenty of room to get things wrong.\nIt is unfortunate but true that bad ideas are sometimes undermined by bad reasoning, and also that sometimes those who espouse offensive and largely false views can say true things. Consider the ‘born this way’ argument, which endorses the flawed assumption that a genetic basis for homosexuality indicates the permissibility of same-sex relationships. While this might win over some individuals, it could cause problems down the line if it turns out that homosexuality isn’t genetically determined. Debates relating to the ‘culture wars’ on college campuses have attracted many ad hominem criticisms that set out to discredit the authors’ position by pointing to the fact that they fit a certain demographic (white, middle-class, male) or share some view with a villainous figure, and thus are not fit to contribute. The point of philosophy is to identify such illegitimate moves, and to keep the argument on topic; sometimes, this requires coming to the defence of bad ideas or villainous characters.\nParticipation in this process can be daunting. Defending an unpopular position can make one a target both for well-directed, thoughtful criticisms, and for emotional, sweeping attacks. Controversial positions on contentious topics attract far more scrutiny than abstract philosophical contributions to niche subjects. This means that, in effect, the former are required to be more rigorous than the latter, and to foresee and head off more potential misappropriations, misinterpretations and misunderstandings – all while contributing to an interdisciplinary area, which requires some understanding not only of philosophical theory but perhaps also medicine, law, natural and social science, politics and various other disciplines.\nThis can be challenging, though I do not mean to be an apologist for thoughtless, sensationalist provocation and controversy-courting, whether delivered by philosophers or others. We should see one important social function of practical ethicists as widening the Overton window and pushing the public and political debate towards reasoned deliberation and respectful disagreement. Widening the Overton window can yield opportunities for ideas that many find offensive, and straightforwardly mistaken, as well as for ideas that are well-defended and reasonable. It is understandable that those with deep personal involvement in these debates often want to narrow the window and push it in the direction of those views they find unthreatening. But philosophers have a professional duty, as conceptual plumbers, to keep the whole system in good working order. This depends upon philosophical contributors upholding the disciplinary standards of academic rigour and intellectual honesty that are essential to ethical reflection, and trusting that this will gradually, collectively lead us in the right direction.","length":7384,"publishedTime":"2019-01-18","rating":[8,7,6,7,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides a thorough exploration of Joseph Overton's concept of the Overton window and its application in the realms of philosophy and practical ethics.

Gov. Mark Robinson is facing backlash after comments he made in 2020 resurfaced on YouTube.  \n The comment happened at an event hosted by the Republican Women of Pitt County. Robinson, who was running for lieutenant governor at the time, was caught on camera saying he would \"absolutely want to go back to the America where women couldn't vote.\" \n We went straight to the source for this one and watched the YouTube video for ourselves. \n A little snippet of the video, which has now gone viral, needs a lot of context. \n In the 2020 video, Robinson referred to a previous question posed to conservative political commentator Candace Owens, who was asked, \"Which America would you want to go back to? One where women couldn't vote or one where Black people were swinging from trees?\" \n Robinson then asked himself the same question, and he said he would pick the situation in which women couldn’t vote. He explained by saying America was better then because Republicans \"fought for real social change.\"\n WCNC Charlotte has reached out to Robinson’s campaign to ask about this video. So far, the campaign hasn't responded to those requests.  \n So while Robinson did say he wanted to go back to an America “where women couldn’t vote,\" that quote itself is taken out of context in the stories circulating around social media.\n Robinson was using it to make a point about the Republican Party supporting women’s suffrage. Here is the rest of what he said:\n \"Because in those days we had people who fought for real social change, and they were called Republicans, and they are the reason why woman can vote today.\"\n So while Robinson holds views that have been criticized as being insensitive and intolerant, in this case, the claim he supports going back to a time when women couldn’t vote isn’t exactly what he said.\n WCNC Charlotte's Verify series is all about trying to make a difference in the Carolinas by making sure the community has the correct information.

The station had to be evacuated and was closed for hours while D.C. firefighters ventilated it.\nThe part at the center of the problem was the collector shoe that connects to the electrified third rail that powers the train along. Shushil Ramnaress, WMATA vice president and chief mechanical officer, said the shoes are actually built to fall off smoothly.\n“The collector shoes are designed to be sacrificial so that they break off without causing failure or damage to the railcar and the vehicle,” Ramnaress said. “While the breaking off is undesirable, it does demonstrate that the shoes work as designed and as intended and does not automatically equate to a safety incident.”\nAccording to Ramnaress, the incident at the Eastern Market station appears to be isolated, but Metro is taking additional safety measures while the investigation continues.\n“We are taking any incident seriously at this point due to the absence of a root cause,” Ramnaress said.\nThe Eastern Market incident comes as riders continue to come back to Metro post-pandemic. WMATA General Manager and CEO Randy Clarke noted ridership in February was up 21% from February of last year, and combined weekend ridership is back to pre-pandemic levels.\nClarke said with Metro halting all construction work for five weeks starting on March 18, he hopes people will use Metrorail and buses to see the cherry blossoms on D.C.’s Tidal Basin when they hit peak bloom. Last year, drivers reported being stuck at Hains Point for hours on the weekend after the blossoms hit peak bloom.\n“We are going to be running great service for this entire period,” Clarke said. “No one should take a car anywhere near the cherry blossoms.”\n Get breaking news and daily headlines delivered to your email inbox by signing up here.\n© 2024 WTOP.

Throughout most of...","textContent":"‘Invest in Women : Accelerate Progress’ is the theme for this Women’s Day, a recognition that women must have economic power if they’re to be equal and independent. But it isn’t so simple. Throughout most of human history, women were not independent agents. They had no assets or income of their own, and merely passed from their parental homes to their marital homes. They depended on marriage to survive. Men’s work outside the home was undergirded by private toils of women. This shoddy transaction was justified by ideals of love and feminine duty, where women seemed to give a lot more than they got.\nThis system of separate and unequal spheres has crumbled in the last century. Women have organised and fought to be recognised as full humans, with the same range of choices men have. Obviously, money is important. No one can operate freely when materially dependent on someone else. Women need education, income, and resources to be their own persons.\nBut we shouldn’t kid ourselves – that’s not enough. Even when women make money, they are caught in a web of social and internalised expectations. Non-compliance is punished. Economic independence has not led to parity, it has even sharpened social and intimate backlash against women. In America, women either own or part-own nearly half of its firms, but this has not toppled the system of male power and status. In India too, a woman’s earnings do not necessarily buy her freedom. It’s assumed her money is for the household rather than for herself. Often, her financial success can be seen as a threat to her husband’s masculinity, or rather, his dominion over her.\nRecently, Bombay HC observed that if a married woman didn’t want to do housework, she should have said so before getting married. That’s just what society thinks. Even now, women put greater effort into caring for their homes and families, prioritising their family over their earning power. When a relationship breaks up, the man can walk out easily, having only been materially strengthened by the marriage, while the woman who had made financial and emotional sacrifices is left even more vulnerable. For all women’s material advances, gender inequality endures. It disfigures romantic relationships, families and workplaces. It straitjackets men too, even though it is set up to serve men’s interests. It is a system of domination that can only be collectively overturned.\n This piece appeared as an editorial opinion in the print edition of The Times of India.","length":3229,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T08:43:36+05:30","rating":[7,7,8,8,7,8,7],"reason":"The article provides a historically informed perspective on women's economic power and independence, highlighting the complex interplay between societal expectations, economic freedom, and gender inequality.

The group that visited Israel is set to deliver a trip report to interested parties, including the Trump campaign, in the coming week, the sources said.\n It’s unclear who in Trump’s orbit was aware of the visit beforehand, but one Trump adviser told CNN the campaign learned about the trip after the fact. The visit included meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s minister of strategic affairs, Ron Dermer, and Knesset Speaker Amir Ohana, the sources said.\n Kellogg made the trip in his current role as the co-chair of the America First Policy Institute and was accompanied by a handful of other national security experts from the think tank, which appears to be laying the groundwork for a second Trump administration.\n One source familiar with the meetings said the group came away from the trip with the impression that a two-state solution was not on the table in the near term and that while Israel would favor a short-term halt in the fighting to get hostages freed, the current government is not interested in a long-term ceasefire.\n Trump, who has revealed little so far on how he would approach the crisis, often says in campaign rallies and speeches that he was the most pro-Israel president in history.\n Just days after the group returned, Trump was asked in an interview if he supported calls for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n “Look, I hate seeing what’s happening. Again, it would have never happened. This attack on Israel and likewise Israel’s counterattack, which is what it is, would’ve never have happened if I was president,” Trump said on Fox News, avoiding a direct answer.\n Trump also appeared to back the Israel Defense Forces’ conduct in Gaza, saying, “You’ve got to finish the problem.”\n On October 7, Hamas launched a deadly surprise attack on Israel. Israel responded with a brutal military campaign in Gaza – including a ground invasion and airstrikes – that has triggered an ongoing humanitarian crisis.\n President Joe Biden has faced intense backlash among Muslims, Arab Americans and progressive voters in the US over his public support for Israel as it conducts its operation in Gaza. More recently, Biden and his administration have adopted a tougher tone toward Israel, calling on Netanyahu and his government to ensure adequate humanitarian aid is flowing into the besieged enclave and to limit civilian causalities.\n Some Trump allies say they see an opening with the growing discontent within Biden’s coalition and the administration’s response – particularly among voters who support Israel. But when Kellogg was in Israel, he was focused on policy, not politics, sources said.\n “The reality is that Biden’s position on the war is prolonging the war. His administration is no longer acting with clarity and is creating daylight with our No. 1 ally, Israel,” said Aryeh Lightstone, who served as a senior adviser to the Trump administration’s ambassador to Israel and attended many of the meetings with Kellogg. “But Kellogg did not prod Israeli officials to engage with him in a partisan way. The conversations were very factual and policy-focused.”\n While Trump has positioned himself as a staunch ally of Israel, his personal relationship with the country’s current leader has at times complicated the former president’s public comments on the crisis.\n The firm friendship between Trump and Netanyahu while Trump was in office has since soured, largely driven by animosity the former president held for Netanyahu ever since the prime minister publicly acknowledged that Biden won the 2020 election.\n In the months that followed, Trump accused Netanyahu of disloyalty and fumed to Axios, “F*** him.”\n Trump upset some advisers and allies when he lashed out at Netanyahu just days after the terror attack in Israel, saying during a campaign rally in Florida that the prime minister was caught unprepared by Hamas’ attack.\n Trump also claimed Israel declined to participate in the 2020 airstrike that killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, saying Netanyahu “let us down.”\n Trump faced intense backlash following those remarks, and he and his allies have continued to highlight Trump’s positions on Israel while in office, including the signing of the Abraham Accords normalizing diplomatic relations between Israel and certain Arab countries; moving the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv; and recognizing the Golan Heights as being under Israeli sovereignty.","length":5448,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T23:12:26.161Z","rating":[7,8,7,6,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed account of former President Trump's allies visiting Israel to discuss the conflict in Gaza.

He blamed him for the Supreme Court decision to overturn the Roe v Wade ruling which guaranteed abortion rights and for blocking bipartisan immigration reforms.Mr Trump, meanwhile, had promised to react in real time to the speech on his Truth Social platform. \"Biden is on the run from his record and lying like crazy to try to escape accountability for the horrific devastation he and his party have created,\" he wrote.\"They continue the very policies that are causing this horror show to go,\" he said.Media caption, Alabama Senator Katie Britt started the Republican response with a jab at the president's ageMr Biden aggressive approach on Thursday may have been born, at least in part, out of necessity. At 81, he is the oldest president in US history and has been beset by questions about his age and mental acuity. His approval ratings are the lowest of any modern president seeking re-election. He is in a statistical dead heat with Mr Trump, however, who also is viewed negatively by voters.Even when Mr Biden addressed his age, he did so with a jab at Mr Trump, who at 77 is only a few years younger than him. \"I know it may not look like it, but I've been around for a while,\" he said. After rattling off a list of positive attributes he said defined America, he added a kicker.\"Some other people my age see a different story: an American story of resentment, revenge and retribution.\"A punchy exchange on immigrationMr Biden regularly ad-libbed responses to what was at times a hostile audience on the Republican side of the chamber. He quipped, parried and expressed mock surprise at their outbursts.When the topic turned to immigration, a subject of political vulnerability for the president, he was once again ready to engage. But here, he stumbled.After Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene accused him of ignoring the murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, allegedly by an undocumented Venezuelan immigrant, Mr Biden held up a button with her name on it - one Ms Greene had given him as he walked in.Media caption, Watch: \"Say her name, Mr President\" - Marjorie Taylor Greene interrupts the speechAfter seemingly mispronouncing her name as \"Lincoln\" Riley, he said she was murdered by an \"illegal\" - a term criticised by immigrant-rights groups.Mr Biden went on to call for Republicans to support the bipartisan immigration legislation passed by the Senate and accused Mr Trump of \"playing politics\" by opposing the bill for electoral gain. The damage, however, may have been done.A sales pitch for NovemberWhen Mr Biden wasn't throwing haymakers at his opponent, he sought to highlight what he characterised as a record of accomplishment during his first term and outline a sales pitch for his re-election.\"I inherited an economy that was on the brink,\" he said, \"and now our economy is the envy of the world.\"Figures on the American economy have been trending up for months now. The public perception of the economy, however, has been much darker.Mr Biden nodded at this split, calling the US economic revival \"the greatest story never told\".Whether the president's words will be enough to change minds, however, remains to be seen.It was a speech geared toward the American middle class - the voters of moderate means who make up the bulk of the electorate.It included a variety of new proposals, most of which would require congressional legislation to enact - an unlikely scenario unless Democrats retake the House of Representatives in November. He pitched a tax credit for new home buyers, who have seen their purchasing power eroded by higher mortgage rates. He also called for expanding a cap on prescription drug spending to every American who has health insurance and raising taxes on corporations.Walking the line on GazaMr Biden opened his speech with a call for military aid to Ukraine, but the bulk of his discussion of foreign policy came towards the end when he turned his attention to the Middle East. The Gaza war has divided Democrats, with a vocal portion of the president's liberal flank calling for the US to use every means at its disposal to push for a ceasefire. Some took to the Washington streets on Thursday evening in an unsuccessful attempt to block the president's motorcade from reaching the Capitol.Mr Biden said his administration was working towards a ceasefire that would last \"at least 6 weeks,\" and he detailed a new plan - announced earlier in the day - for the US to construct a temporary seaport in Gaza to allow humanitarian aid to enter by ship.He had some harsh words for Israel, calling the civilian casualties in Gaza \"heartbreaking\" and saying it had a \"fundamental responsibility\" to protect innocent lives.Mr Biden's speech, because it was delivered without any significant stumbles or gaffes, is a hurdle cleared for the president - and its content could serve as a guide to how his campaign plans to sell the American public on another four years of Democratic governance.At the very least, it will probably convince nervous Democrats that their presumptive nominee is ready to go toe-to-toe with his Republican opponent in November.More on the US electionMore on this story","length":6680,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T05:21:56.000Z","rating":[5,4,6,5,7,6,7],"reason":"The article provides factual information about President Biden's State of the Union address and his confrontational approach towards Donald Trump.

(GLA)The Greater London Authority has launched the search for a new partner to redevelop Royal Albert Dock, part of the Royal Docks, and one of London's major development opportunities.The GLA said the 30-acre (12 hectare) site has the potential for 4.3 million square feet of development close to Excel, University of East London and City Airport.The Mayor of London also published ambitions to develop 36,000 new homes and 55,000 jobs at Royal Docks, which includes the Royal Albert Dock site. Montagu Evans, which was appointed to provide strategic advise on the project last year, is advising on the development partner search.Royal Albert Dock is in the capital’s only enterprise zone. The marketing brief says employment uses on the site could include green technology and digital economy uses, sport, leisure and cultural production as well as life sciences, light-industrial and manufacturing, logistics, workspace and education.That development will sit alongside a partially completed first phase, the majority of which has now been purchased by DPK, run by champion jockey and entrepreneur David Maxwell, as revealed by CoStar News in 2022. DPK initially bought a controlling stake in the energy centre at the site. The group then pieced together a bid for the critical first phase of the development, where six buildings have been completed.Royal Albert Dock has extant planning consents for ultimately more than 3.5 million square feet of development incorporating residential, retail and commercial close to a station for the new Elizabeth line.The first phase was marketed for sale through liquidator PwC. Plans were for a total of 21 BREAAM Excellent waterside buildings adding up to more than 488,000 square feet.Accountancy firm PwC was appointed as liquidator to 23 companies in the ABP Group, the Chinese developer behind the stalled plans, in July 2022. The completed units in the first phase, 56,000 square feet of offices and retail, have largely remained empty.Planning and development consultancy Montagu Evans has been working with the Greater London Authority on a strategic review of the wider site across phases two to six. To complicate matters, in March 2022, CoStar News revealed that Deloitte HK, acting as administrator for Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank, had appointed Oxygen Asset Management, the UK investor, asset and development manager, to advise on the asset management and disposal of the six developed offices at the stalled scheme.ABP had secured £60 million in funding from Hang Seng Bank previously to refinance part of a construction loan on the first phase of the scheme, which was due to mature.The developer had been working on the project with joint venture partner the Greater London Authority and partner and lender Citic. Royal Albert Dock is within the wider Royal Docks area and is one of seven large development sites being brought forward across 175 hectares of public land belonging to the GLA. Approximately £5 billion of investment is planned for the area over the next 20 years.A new Delivery Plan (2024-2029) sets out the vision and key delivery priorities for the Royal Docks over the next five years.The major of London's City Hall home relocated to the Royal Docks in 2022 from London Bridge.Anchor institutions such as Tate & Lyle, ExCeL London, London City Airport and the University of East London are located by the site, which is on the north side of the historic Royal Albert Dock water body. To the south is London City Airport, to the west is ExCel London and to the east University of East London.The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said in a statement: “Once the beating heart of global trade, today the Royal Docks is re-emerging as one of the country’s leading areas of opportunity, investment, and innovation.“I am pleased that we are now looking for a new development partner to transform Royal Albert Dock, one of the key sites in the Royal Docks. This will play a major role in the capital’s continuing economic success and growth Eastwards.”Procurement of a new development partner is being led by the Royal Docks team, a joint initiative from the Mayor of London and the Mayor of Newham, on behalf of GLA Land and Property as freeholder.Formal procurement is expected to start in summer 2024 following an initial period of market engagement in the spring.The seven developments that are being brought forward on land owned by the GLA are: Royal Albert Dock, Silvertown, Albert Island, Royal Albert Wharf, Thameside West, Royal Victoria Square and Royal Eden Docks.\nIn 2015 Chinese President Xi Jinping and the-then UK Prime Minister David Cameron were on site to sign an initial deal to bring forward the massive derelict London riverfront area as a finance hub with £200 million of initial financing being provided by leading Chinese banks.ABP, run by Chinese developer Xu Weiping, had planned to sell some buildings to owner-occupiers while leasing up others for income. In particular, it targeted Chinese occupiers and investors who wanted to coalesce in one area relatively close to central London.Subsequently, the ramifications of Brexit and deteriorating Anglo-China relations plus the coronavirus and the ongoing retrenchment of Chinese real estate companies from foreign investment all played their part in slowing progress. Other Chinese developers selling out of or reducing their commitments to major London projects have included R&F, Shimao and Greenland.In an interview with CoStar News in 2020 Xu described how the scheme had been remodelled in response to all of these factors.Just one office tenant, Taiwanese technology firm Advantech, had moved into the project's 21-building first phase then, taking up a mere 2,200 square feet, and chairman Xu said the company was planning to remarket and convert the space into 2,000 micro offices aimed at capitalising on an anticipated demand for personalised space.","length":6032,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,6,8,5,7,7,6],"reason":"The article provides a comprehensive overview of the redevelopment plans for Royal Albert Dock in East London, discussing the search for a new partner, the potential for development, existing partnerships, challenges faced, and future prospects.

Experts say it could hurt you","byline":"Lakshana N Palat","excerpt":"Applying petroleum jelly to your eyes could cause more infections…","textContent":"The internet is a smorgasbord of self-proclaimed life hacks, and TikTok is at the wheel with \"wow, that might actually work?\" moments. However, not every viral trend is the ticket to health and wellness. The latest one is: Smearing petroleum jelly into the corner of the eyes to prevent it from watering during dry, cold, windy or rainy days. The idea is that it acts as a protective barrier, which can shield against the harsh effects of the cold weather and reduce excessive tearing.The hashtag watering eyes has now gathered more than 92 million views on TikTok, with several users advising their followers to put petroleum jelly or Vaseline (a branded version) in the corner of their eyes.\n It all began last year, when people shared that their eyes were watering during cold, windy or dry days. Last year, TikToker @yazmoore appeared to post the solution: A simple hack that involves dipping a Q-tip into Vaseline and placing a small amount at the corners of the eyes. “All you need is just some Vaseline, and then little cotton buds,” she says. “My makeup used to run really badly, because my eyes were so watery. All you need to do is just apply [the Vaseline] to the corner of your eyes. Try not to poke yourself in the eye. That is literally it… Try this out, this works.”\n The trend caught fire, and more people have shared videos saying that it is the solution to the problem. “Saw a video of a girl putting Vaseline in the corner of her eyes before leaving the house to stop the eyes from watering and it’s been the best thing TikTok has taught me,” one video states.\n TikTok user Dani, who has a follower list of around 468,000 people, became a sensation after a video where she puts petroleum jelly as a moisturiser to create a luminous effect, which she says Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe used to do. Recently, Dani put petroleum jelly in the corner of her eye using a Q-Tip, which stops her eyes from watering altogether. While this “hack” received rave praise in the comment sections, others were rather sceptical and dubious.\n One person commented that it causes eye infections. Another added that they tried this little trick, and their eyes grew puffy. Yet, people still continue to follow this hack.\n Is it safe? Does it work? US-based ophthalmologist Vicki Chan endorsed the trend, too, in a video, saying, “I definitely see how this works. By putting a little bit of petroleum jelly here on the corners, you’re basically creating a barrier, so that the tears don’t come out.”\n Well, skincare specialists are particularly nonplussed and concerned about this trend and have a couple of things to say.\n By applying petroleum jelly on the rim of your eyes, you are preventing the tears from draining properly.\n Your eyes water for a reason, folks. Tears keep the eyes lubricated and protected, shielding you from dust and allergens. As experts explain, they contain powerful antimicrobial elements that can fend off harmful bacteria and other infections.\n As Ghazal Youssef, a Dubai-based dermatologist explains, “The eyelids contain meibomian glands, which help to regulate the quality of the tears. Vaseline, which is the brand name for petroleum jelly, can disrupt this natural process. By applying Vaseline on the rim of your eyes, you are preventing the tears from draining properly, explains Ilami. “This leads to a build-up of tears, which results in your eyes feeling watery and uncomfortable. Not just this, Vaseline acts as a deterrent to the natural production of tears, which finally leaves your eyes vulnerable to dryness and irritation.”\n The irony is, putting petroleum jelly on your eyes to prevent dryness might actually make them drier in the long run, she adds.\n You need to exercise caution when applying anything to your eyes for a start, warns Hina Khan, a Dubai-based dermatologist. They are rather delicate ecosystems and something foreign, non-sterile like petroleum jelly has the potential to do more harm than good, she says. Worse, it can clog the tiny glands in your eyelids, which results in painful styes and cysts. Not quite the aesthetic, you wished for, right?\n Putting petroleum jelly close to the eye can even cause milia, as Khan explains. Milia are small, white bumps that appear on the skin, around the eyes. “This develops when keratin, which is a protein naturally found in the skin, gets trapped under the surface and forms a cyst,” she says.\n Eye creams are different, as compared to face creams, reminds Dalya Sager, a senior medical aesthetician and skin expert. \"They are specifically formulated for the delicate eye contour region, so they can be absorbed efficiently into the dermal layer. Petroleum jelly is not formulated like eye creams and cannot be asborbed,\" she says. It sits on the skin's surface and blocks the pores, causing issues for the skin. \n Do not attempt if you already have eye irritations, say experts. If you absolutely must attempt it, use a minimal amount and ensure that it doesn’t directly enter your eyes, warns Khan. A tiny dab is key. However, the moment you experience any irritation, wash your eyes with clean water and give the hack a boot. This is more of a quick fix, and not suitable for the long run, she says. Skip it, to be safe.","length":5863,"publishedTime":"2024-03-06T07:00:28+04:00","rating":[2,4,7,5,6,4,3],"reason":"The article scores low on Accuracy due to promoting a TikTok trend of using petroleum jelly in the eyes without highlighting the potential risks associated with it.

The numbers are on the rise: Some communities have already protected 300 nests in a single season.The Brazilian Amazon is a priority area for chelonian conservation, with 21 species described by scientists. Fourteen species live in Juruti, one of which is endemic.Despite being banned by environmental legislation, consumption of turtle eggs and meat still seems to be part of local traditions, contributing to reduce the number of individuals; mining and dam construction projects also threat the survival of the species. JURUTI, Pará state, Brazil — One of the little sand piles appears to be moving. Fábio Andrew Cunha opens the way with his hands, and a baby pitiú emerges from the nest. Measuring around 4 centimetrs (1.6 inches), the turtle passes its flipper over its right eye and then repeats the gesture on the left side. Its eyes must be cleared so it can see the new world. Seconds later, another baby turtle comes out.\nLiving in one of the world’s most biodiverse biomes for chelonians, residents of Juruti have seen the number of turtles and other species plummet over the past few generations. Stories told by their ancestors and their own observations about that drastic reduction led riverside dwellers from 32 communities in the municipality of Juruti, Pará, to organize independently and voluntarily to preserve species such as the Amazon turtle (Podocnemis expansa), tracajá (P. unifilis), pitiú (P. sextuberculata) and irapuca (P. erythrocephala).\nRiverbank in the municipality of Juruti, Pará. Excessive heat and severe drought warmed the waters and lowered the level of Amazonian lakes and rivers, creating difficulties for turtles to lay their eggs. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\nTheir work consists of watching the beaches at night from September onward, when the spawning season begins and females become more vulnerable. Afterward, community members collect the eggs from each nest and take them to a nursery or hatchery — a fenced sand area where the eggs are protected until baby turtles are born. Then they are placed in tanks until their release, which in 2023 occurred in early March.\n“Species are managing to increase their wild population in Amazon rivers as a result of basic community management work,” says Cunha, a chelonian expert from Juruti. “Today we have 21 species of turtles described in the Brazilian Amazon. In this area [Juruti], we have already managed to catalog 14 species, one of which is endemic. We consider Brazil a turtle hotspot, a priority area for the conservation of the group.”\nFormer residents used to say there were more turtles in the rivers than stars in the sky. “In some rivers in the Amazon, navigation of large boats was impossible due to the concentration of females, especially during the spawning season, when they form large bales to go upstream and lay their eggs together on the beaches,” Cunha says.\nHowever, the number of turtles has drastically decreased in the area. According to Cunha, a biologist with a PhD in aquatic ecology and conservation in the Amazon, in the 1970s and 1980s, Juruti became a hub for gathering turtle eggs and hunting adult females. As a traditional food item, eggs were even used to pay bills, and turtle meat was once considered the second main source of animal protein in the local diet, only after fish.\nTracajá eggs are relocated and watched over by riverside dwellers at the Lake Tucunaré hatchery. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\nChelonian expert Fábio Andrew Cunha monitors the work of 32 communities in Juruti. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\nCurrently, laws protecting wild fauna ban the consumption of turtle eggs and meat. But in Juruti, the story is different between August and September: “You can often smell the [roasting] shell when you walk through the streets. I’m talking about the reality of a single place, but this happens in almost all small towns in the Amazon,” Cunha says.\nIt is true that a significant portion of the population has already realized the importance of preserving turtles, but research shows that approximately 1.7 million of them were consumed in urban areas of Amazonas state in 2018.\nIn addition to illegal hunting, the turtles face other threats. “Large-scale mining projects implemented in the Amazon affect the landscape both in spawning sites and in shelter and feeding areas,” Cunha points out. In Juruti, bauxite extraction by mining company Alcoa since 2009 has resulted in unprecedented financial settlements over socioenvironmental damages.\nDeforestation, oil exploration and river dams built to expand energy options also pose dangers. “There are several combined changes that ultimately reduce the numbers and population structure of both females and males.”\nBased on the reports of their ancestors and observing the number of chelonians dwindling, community members were inspired by existing projects in the Amazon, such as the Quelônios da Amazônia Program and the Pé-de-Pincha Project, and organized independently and voluntarily to protect their surroundings.\nA rare albino turtle born in the Caapiranga community.

There is a 25-year-old guy who started following the work when he was 8,” says Marunei Guerreiro de Mesquita, leader of the project in the Miri community in the rural area of Juruti, which gathers 20 volunteers in the Miri Environmental Warriors Association. “I’m the old one; the others are young.”\nFifteen years ago, when they started the management work, the community members were able to relocate around 50 nests to the hatchery each season. Recently, they have relocated more than 270 nests per year.\nThe enclosure with the eggs collected is located in front of Mesquita’s house, on the banks of the floodplain lake that connects to the Amazon River. In this season, there are 225 nests, fewer than in previous years, probably due to the severe drought that hit the area, changing the water regime and leaving the headwaters of lakes and rivers extremely dry.\nMarunei Guerreiro de Mesquita leads 20 volunteers in their work to protect turtles in the Miri community. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\nThe Brazilian Amazon is a “turtle hotspot,” with 21 species of chelonians described by science. Juruti has 14 species, one of which is endemic. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\nSince the beginning of the project, the numbers have risen year after year. Not without difficulties, though. “Because of the work I do, I got in trouble with people in the community, with the [municipal environment] department, with community leaders. But this work won’t pay my bills,” Mesquita says.\nDespite the challenges faced to obtain resources to keep up the work, Mesquita feels rewarded by the increase in the number of chelonians in the area, by the fact that many people admire the project, and by the new generations of volunteers joining it.\n“We learn a lot and we’ll carry this forward to the generation of our children, our grandchildren,” says 20-year-old Jelso Santarém, who started working on the project when he was 13.\nThe tank is located in Mesquita’s backyard, where newborn turtles live for a few months. Last November, the tank was already home to a sizable number of them.\nCunha recently arrived from Bolivia, where he participated in a meeting of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to assess the status of Amazonian chelonians. He holds a baby pitiú in his hand, one of his favorite species and one of the most threatened. “It’s the most beautiful in the world; it seems to be asking us for a hug.”\nIn the nursery, more pitiú hatchlings are born. Two-year-old Henry Mesquita Santarém watches the event. “Put it in the box,” the boy says, referring to the plastic foam containers. Henry goes up the hill in the backyard with his grandfather Mesquita, helping as much as he can to carry the foam box to the breeding tank.\nEdnaldo Lima de Sousa, project coordinator at Lake Capiranga, carries baby turtles. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\nYoung tracajá turtles (brown) and a pitiú (gray). The pitiú is predators’ favorite. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\n“The pitiú is predators’ favorite species,” says Ednaldo Lima de Sousa, head of the project that has been operating in the Caapiranga community since 2005. “If we don’t take care of these animals that are here, we won’t be seeing any later.”\nIn addition to doing turtle management, many communities also manage fish. “We have a fishing agreement. Not everyone is allowed; we try to preserve it for the community. This is our agreement,” Sousa explains.\nIn the Caapiranga community, the increase in the number of turtles is visible and there has already been a season with 300 protected nests. “The little animals started to get close to the area where they are already preserved,” says Edir Lima de Sousa, who works with his brother Ednaldo and eight other community members.\nInside the nursery, which this year has almost a hundred nests with a privileged view of Lake Capiranga, baby tracajás emerge from the sand. Sousa helps them by clearing space at the nest’s exit, but not everything goes as planned. Few hatchlings come out; some eggs are partially or completely cooked inside the nest and some have failed to develop and hatch.\n“We’d been having very positive results, but the severe drought causes general disturbance,” Cunha says.\nEggs cooked and baby turtles killed by high temperatures. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\nWith the sand at 43o Celsius (109.4o Fahrenheit), reports of female turtles dead on riverbanks have also been common. “They were going upstream to lay their eggs and couldn’t do it, either because of the distance or the very high temperature.”\nAnother current concern is that temperature has an influence on sex determination of several species of river turtles. “It may be that high temperatures produce more females than the normal balance for the population. We need balance between males and females, so we are talking about a feminization process.”\nOn a night with a full moon and stars hidden by smoke from fires, Mongabay follows the forays of the little motorboat known as rabeta into the lake in search of adult females — without success.\n“In a perfect scenario, we’d now be measuring, photographing and marking around 50, 60 females,” Cunha says. “We put the nets in the water and didn’t catch any animals. The reason is not known yet. I believe that more severe drought and illegal capture have driven females away or led them to choose other locations.”\nNests protected in a hatchery at Lake Caapiranga. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\nDomingos Pereira Campos carries the foam container in his arms, as if it were a child. Inside are 29 tracajá eggs that he just collected from a nest on the banks of Lake Tucunaré. The eggs will be relocated and monitored in the nursery a few meters away. “You have to take them to the pit carefully so as not to shake them,” he warns.\nEntering the hatchery’s fence, Campos, who has worked with the project since its beginning in 2012, chooses a spot and digs a hole with a more pronounced, belly-shaped curve on one side.\n“That’s nature’s way. We try to do it more or less like nature, but it’s not the same,” he shows. “We take them out and then put them back in the other pit. The last one to come out goes to the bottom first.”\n“If you can observe how carefully the female builds the nest … it’s very moving. It’s a chamber that keeps the temperature,” Cunha says.\nIndeed, not everything can be copied as nature created it. “Of course, with the displacement of eggs from their natural environment to the hatchery, there is some loss because we can’t literally choose the same microclimate as in nature. So a small percentage is expected to fail,” he explains.\nThe increase in the number of turtles in Juruti is directly linked to the work of riverside dwellers, who watch the beaches during the spawning season, collect the eggs and care for newborn chelonians. \nLate afternoon in the Miri community. Image by Julia Lemos Lima/Mongabay.\nEvery interference has its consequences — not only the change of nest location but also the months in which the young turtles grow in the tanks until they are released, which can compromise their ability to escape predators, their swimming agility and their aptitude to look for their own food.\nExperts suggest that some of the young turtles be taken to the water immediately after birth to encourage adult females to return to the spawning site.\n“With the discovery of vocalization, we found out that there is parental care between females and their offspring,” Cunha reports. Studies have shown that turtle embryos emit sounds, alerting females of their birth. If the females are waiting for it and do not receive any offspring, they may consider the place unsafe for laying eggs in the future.\nEven though the careful protection by community members is not exactly a mirror of nature, the real positive impact of conservation work on rural communities can be seen in Juruti, with the species’ population growth and the increase in the number of nests.\nOn a hot November afternoon, walking along the banks of Lake Tucunaré, Fábio Cunha finds another nest. This will be the 183rd to be taken into the hatchery.\n“We started this in 2012, and in 2013, we already managed to obtain six nests and 212 baby turtles,” says Jorge Simões, head of the project at Lake Tucunaré. “Residents became more and more supportive, and now it’s a huge success. Last year, we released 4,150 turtles. So, each year that passes, it evolves more.”\nBanner image: Tracajás protected by riverside dwellers in the Tucunaré community, municipality of Juruti (PA).

Pretty prescient: Recent Gallup polls show that teenagers between 13 and 19 spend 4.8 hours daily on mainly TikTok and YouTube, far more time than they spend on homework.\nShaw was not the only one to make the latter observation.  Long before him, Voltaire wrote repeatedly that “Work saves us from three great evils: boredom, vice and need.”\nMore recently, Eric Hoffer, in his “The True Believer” on the rise of radicalism and mobs had this to say:\nThere is perhaps no more reliable indicator of a society’s ripeness for a mass movement than the prevalence of unrelieved boredom.  In almost all descriptions of the periods preceding the rise of mass movements there is reference to vast ennui, and in their earliest stages mass movements are more likely to find sympathizers and support among the bored than among the exploited and oppressed … They must be wholly ignorant, easily persuaded and led… Experience is a handicap.\nHow is boredom, avoiding work inadvertently, created and financed? The coming celebrated holiday of Freedom – the Exodus – is a good reminder what not to do and that freedom, accompanied by massive welfare without requiring discipline and self-restraint, bring boredom and mobs betting on false idols.  \nStrangely, as in romantic Hollywood movies, the collective memory about the exodus from Egypt and slavery stops with the “happy ending” of escaping to “freedom” and pays no attention to the events that followed, though history is rhyming.\nThe events were these: Despite the miracles, the new God performed in Egypt and when parting the sea, the freed slaves complained non-stop, ready to stone Moses. The water was not as good as it was in Egypt and there was not enough of it. \nMoses struck rocks and fresh spring water came. But the food was more plentiful and tastier in Egypt, they complained, so God orchestrated the Fall of Manna, or free food catered to please any desired taste.  Briefly, the multitude became in no time a fully subsidized, food-stamped welfare mob. \nAll miracles notwithstanding, as soon as Moses goes to the mountain to bring down the 10 commandments set in stone (eight of which are “no’s” requiring self-restraint) but does not return on the promised 40th day, the welfare mob loses faith, abandons the God that brought them to freedom, reverts to old deities and builds the Golden Calf. Moses promptly crashes the stones and the written commandments turn to dust.\nExodus spends seven chapters ​(25-31) describing in tedious detail how the tribe-in-the-making must build the Tabernacle before Moses destroys the stones. Then, following his outburst, another six chapters ​(35-40) repeat in minute detail the materials and intense non-stop work required for the Tabernacle’s construction.   The repetition is not as strange as it appears.  \nThough the 10 commandments appear orally before (Chapter 19), the multitude, used to “solid” deities, saw nothing in writing. Why bother, then, to work so hard? They do commit to hard work only when Moses comes down for a second time with the re-written stones intact – and also putting the fear of God in the multitude by instructing the killing of 3,000 of them.\nThis is an unacceptably harsh lesson on how now to restore self-restraint, discipline and induce people to get off welfare and start working – though weaning masses of youngsters passing for “students and scholars” from massive subsidies (started with the 1958 National Defense Education Act’s good intentions) and restoring law and order may help. \n[An] individual is free of boredom only when he is engaged either in creative work or some absorbing occupation… Pleasure-chasing and dissipation are ineffective palliatives. Where people live autonomous lives and are not badly off, yet are without abilities or opportunities for creative work or useful action, there is no telling to what desperate and fantastic shifts they might resort in order to give meaning and purpose to their lives.\nRecall, too, that in 1968 Harvard’s president at the time called in the police to restore order when students occupied buildings renaming a hall as “Che Guevara,” sang “Sieg Heil” and shoved banana down the throats of professors before pushing them down the stairs. Though even then only one Harvard professor stood up to denounce his complacent colleagues. \nThe article draws on Brenner’s Force of Finance and recent sequence of articles on universities and student debt forgiveness","length":6227,"publishedTime":"2024-03-04T06:02:35Z","rating":[6,7,6,7,7,6,5],"reason":"The article provides a mix of historical references and modern-day examples to discuss the decline of work ethics and the rise of boredom in society.

A historian unpacks the medieval invention − and skepticism − of the witch on a broomstick","byline":"Michael D. Bailey","excerpt":"The iconic image of a witch on a broomstick has apocryphal origins. But whether they could actually fly didn’t stop Christian society from persecuting them.","textContent":"The image of a witch flying on a broomstick is iconic, but it is not nearly as old as the idea of witchcraft itself, which dates to the earliest days of humankind.\nSeveral theologians, church inquisitors, secular magistrates and other authorities first wrote about such flight in the early 1400s. The earliest known visual depiction of flying witches appears in a 1451 manuscript copy of one such text, “Le champion des dames” (“The Defender of Ladies”), by the French poet Martin Le Franc.\nWitchcraft accusations at this time were increasingly focused on women. The clothing of the figures in Le Franc’s text depicts them as coming from non-elite ranks of medieval society. So do the implements on which they fly. Staffs and brooms were tools for ordinary housework.\nThe notion that witches could fly served to support the idea that they gathered in large groups called sabbaths. These gatherings, in turn, heightened the supposed threat witches posed to Christian society. \nEven after the idea of witches flying on brooms was introduced to European society, it was not readily accepted. Many who wrote about witchcraft at this time, including Le Franc, were quite skeptical about the reality of flying witches.\nAs it turned out, however, authorities could still perceive a threat even if they believed witches’ flight was imaginary. \nIn my work as a scholar of medieval European history, I have researched texts describing witchcraft in the early 1400s. \nSome texts fully accepted the idea that witches flew, often on brooms or staffs. One described witches traveling to sabbaths on staffs anointed with a magical ointment and flying into the mountains to gather ice to cause hailstorms.\nOther texts, however, were not sure that such flight was real. One noted that accused witches claimed to fly from mountaintop to mountaintop on chairs, but it also hinted that demons might have tricked them into thinking they did. Another text stated that accused witches who claimed to fly were “deluded” by the devil. \n Witches were often depicted flying on household implements such as brooms and staffs.\n Martin Le Franc/W. Schild. Die Maleficia der Hexenleut' via Wikimedia Commons\nSkepticism about flying witches drew on an early 10th-century church law about women who claimed to ride at night on “certain beasts” in the train of the pagan goddess Diana, whom Christian authorities understood to be a demon in disguise. The law declared that such flight was not real, and anyone who thought so had been “seduced by illusions and phantasms of demons.” It prescribed no direct punishment but mandated priests preach against such “infidels.”\nSkeptics of magical flight were quite specific in their doubts. Le Franc, for example, declared that anyone who thought that witches could fly lacked “common sense.” On the other hand, he fully accepted that magicians, who were generally male, could conjure demons and that “magic arts” had been practiced as far back as ancient Persia.\nThe story, however, is not so simple as male authorities accepting the reality of magic practiced by men but doubting that women flew on brooms. These same authorities were, in general, taking other aspects of witchcraft more seriously.\nDid women accused of witchcraft really insist that they flew on brooms? \nScholars have speculated that the ointments often mentioned in accounts of such flight might have functioned as hallucinogens, producing sensations of flying. The most thorough study of these accounts, however, finds that such references rarely appear in voluntary testimony. They come instead from authorities recording, and often reshaping, what accused witches said.\nIn the end, allegations of flight and dismissal of its reality may have sprung entirely from the minds of legal and religious authorities who codified and condemned the idea of witchcraft. \nTheir skepticism hardly mattered. Courts could execute convicted witches regardless of whether they believed they could fly. \nAlthough witch-hunting ended – at least in Europe and North America – in the 18th century, the image of witches flying on brooms endures.","length":4251,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,9,7,6,8,7,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed historical account of the invention of the concept of witches flying on broomsticks in the medieval period, citing specific texts and visual depictions to support its claims.

Gold has increased by around 7% a year for the past 10 years but it’s never mentioned on any of The Compound shows as a good investment. It is not better than holding cash as cash purchasing power will go down as inflation goes up whereas gold will at least keep up?\nGold hit a new all-time high this week at over $2,100 an ounce. So it’s a good time to take a look since more people will be paying attention to the yellow metal.\nReturns for gold have been decent over the past 10 years but not quite 7% per year. I’m showing returns of more than 4% per year over the past 10 years:\nGold is seen as a diversifier so even though it hasn’t kept pace with the stock market1 over the past decade, it can be helpful to look at the longer-term returns.\nLuckily, Aswath Damodaran added gold to his historical annual return data at NYU this year. These are the annual returns numbers for stocks (S&P 500), bonds (10 year Treasuries), cash (3-month T-Bills) and gold from 1928-2023:\nSo gold has done better than bonds and cash but trailed the stock market by a decent clip.\nThe price of gold was essentially controlled by the government until 1971 when Nixon ended the gold standard of converting dollars to gold at a fixed rate.\nFrom 1928-1970, gold was up 1.4% per year which was less than the annual inflation rate of 2% in that time.\nFrom 1971 to 2023, gold was up 7.9% per year. That lags the S&P 500 return of 10.8% annually, but the correlation of the annual returns was -0.2, implying some solid diversification benefits.\nHowever, those post-1970 returns require some context as well. The returns are front-loaded in the 1970s.\nFrom 1971-1979, gold was up nearly 1,300% in total. That was good enough for a nine year annual return of 33.8% per year.2 Some would say gold was an amazing inflation hedge in the 1970s. Others would say those massive returns were just playing catch-up from the decades in which the government artificially held the price down.\nIf you look at the gains since 1980, they tell a different story. From 1980-2023, gold was up just 3.2% per year. That lagged the returns for stocks (+11.7%), bonds (+6.5%) and cash (+4.0%).\nIn that same timeframe, the annual inflation rate was 3.2%, meaning gold had a real return over a 44 year period of a big fat zero. Technically the price of gold has trailed the consumer price index since 1980:\nIt’s important to note that although gold hasn’t done much on a long-run basis outside of the 1970s, there have still been periods when it provided valuable diversification benefits.\nDuring the lost decade of the aughts from 2000-2009, the S&P 500 was down 1% per year. In that same decade, gold rose more than 14% on an annual basis.\nIn fact, this century gold is outperforming the S&P 500. These are the annual returns from 2000-2023:\nThat’s from an all-time bad starting point for large cap U.S. stocks but the same is true of gold in 1980.\nStocks have outperformed in the decade-and-a-half since the end of the Great Financial Crisis. Here are the annual returns from 2009-2023:\nAs with most asset classes, you could craft a good reason for or against gold depending on your start or end date of historical returns.\nThe long-term case for gold is up in the air. There are no cash flows — no dividends or income or earnings. But people have placed value on gold for thousands of years. That means something.\nThere are also the diversification benefits, which you can clearly see when breaking out the annual returns by decade:\nDiversification is gold’s biggest selling point. It really does march to the beat of its own drum.\nI have nothing against gold. I just don’t think it’s necessarily the right investment for my risk tolerance or allocation preferences. I don’t personally invest in gold but I can see why some investors choose to hold an allocation in their portfolio.\nIt’s the kind of asset class that requires rebalancing into the pain, though, because there will be times when it badly lags the stock market.\nIt’s also interesting to think about gold through the lens of millennial/Gen Z gold — Bitcoin.\nThe flows into Bitcoin ETFs these past few months have been impressive.\nEven with new all-time highs in the price of gold, the AUM for the biggest gold ETF (GLD) is one-third below its peak:\nGold is far less volatile than bitcoin so there can be a place for both to exist.\nBut it will be interesting to see if the demand for Bitcoin eventually dampens the demand for gold.\nGold has thousands of years on crypto so I wouldn’t make that bet just yet but technology can change the world in a hurry.\nWe talked about this question on the latest edition of Ask the Compound:\n<span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">﻿</span>\nBill Sweet joined me again on today’s show to discuss questions about the number of stocks it takes to be diversified, tax planning for a move to a high-tax state, retirement contributions when you have freelance income and how tax credits work.\n1The S&P 500 is up 12.5% per year over the past 10 years.\n2$10,000 invested in gold at the end of 1970 would be worth nearly $160,000 by the end of the decade.","length":5587,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T14:00:08-05:00","rating":[6,8,7,5,7,6,6],"reason":"The article provides a fairly accurate overview of the historical performance of gold as an investment, including its returns compared to other asset classes and its role as a diversifier.

Feds Want To Stop Shady Car SalesOffEnglishThat salesperson, however, isn’t always just lying to your face about whether or not they put that TruCoat on at the factory. Sometimes, as R4ndyD4ndy explains, they’re genuinely making the absolute minimum on a deal — just trying to meet their numbers for the month.Having worked in a dealership myself through college (as a lot attendant and occasional de facto head of IT) I saw plenty of mini deals go through. Sometimes a car was sitting there for months, chewing up floor space, or the dealer was just a couple sales away from hitting a target number for the franchise. It’s not impossible to get a genuinely good deal on a new car at a dealership. That’s not to say the franchise is a nonprofit, though. Remember that new and used car sales each make up about a quarter of dealer profits, including their respective F&I income. The rest all comes from the service and parts departments, and those owners who truly believe that the dealer has their best interests at heart in the service bay. That’s not the truth, Ellen — the first priority is still making money. Congratulations, R4ndyD4ndy, on your Comment Of The Day win.

La Fiesta, Marcum, MK, Swad, Supreme Tradition and El Chilar brands of ground cinnamon are typically sold at discount stores and contain between 2.03 and 3.4 parts per million of lead, the agency said. No illnesses have been linked to the products. The FDA said it has recommended voluntary recalls of the cinnamon products, but one manufacturer, MTCI, the distributor of MK cinnamon, has not responded to the agency's correspondence. \n Which brands are covered by the recall? Consumers should discard the impacted cinnamon products, which include: La Fiesta brand, lot number 25033, sold at La Superior Supermercados. Marcum brand, best by dates Oct. 16, 2025 and April 6, 2025, sold at Save A Lot. MK brand, no lot number provided. Swad brand, lot number KX21223, sold at Patel Brothers.

Adults can experience similar impacts, but at much higher amounts of lead, according to the CDC. What about cinnamon products in an earlier recall? Beginning in October 2023, the FDA recalled several brands of cinnamon-flavored applesauce pouches, including WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks for possibly having lead. The agency has been investigating to see if the products were contaminated on purpose. \n \"Historically, lead chromate has been illegally added to certain spices\" to increase their weight and enhance their color, \"which increases the monetary value of the adulterated spices,\" the FDA said in a recent update on that inquiry. \"FDA's leading hypothesis remains that this was likely an act of economically motivated adulteration.\" \n The CDC says it has received reports of 468 confirmed, probable or suspected cases of people with elevated blood lead levels from health departments in 44 states. The FDA says lead contamination was traced to products from a cinnamon processing company called Carlos Aguilera of Ecuador — where regulators say the company in question is no longer operating.

Our database will not include all of these casualties until we have completed further investigations into the circumstances surrounding them. For more information, read our FAQ.\nThe Israel-Gaza war has taken a severe toll on journalists since Hamas launched its unprecedented attack against Israel on October 7 and Israel declared war on the militant Palestinian group, launching strikes on the blockaded Gaza Strip. \nCPJ is investigating all reports of journalists and media workers killed, injured, or missing in the war, which has led to the deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992. \nAs of March 8, 2024, CPJ’s preliminary investigations showed at least 95 journalists and media workers were among the more than 31,000 killed since the war began on October 7—with more than 30,000 Palestinian deaths in Gaza and the West Bank and 1,200 deaths in Israel. \nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) told Reuters and Agence France Press news agencies in October that it could not guarantee the safety of their journalists operating in the Gaza Strip, after they had sought assurances that their journalists would not be targeted by Israeli strikes, according to a Reuters report.\nJournalists in Gaza face particularly high risks as they try to cover the conflict during the Israeli ground assault, including devastating Israeli airstrikes, disrupted communications, supply shortages, and extensive power outages.\n95 journalists and media workers were confirmed dead: 90 Palestinian, 2 Israeli, and 3 Lebanese.\nCPJ is also investigating numerous unconfirmed reports of other journalists being killed, missing, detained, hurt, or threatened, and of damage to media offices and journalists’ homes.\n“CPJ emphasizes that journalists are civilians doing important work during times of crisis and must not be targeted by warring parties,” said Sherif Mansour, CPJ’s Middle East and North Africa program coordinator. “Journalists across the region are making great sacrifices to cover this heart-breaking conflict. Those in Gaza, in particular, have paid, and continue to pay, an unprecedented toll and face exponential threats. Many have lost colleagues, families, and media facilities, and have fled seeking safety when there is no safe haven or exit.”\nThe list published here includes names based on information obtained from CPJ’s sources in the region and media reports. It includes all journalists* involved in news-gathering activity. It is unclear whether all of these journalists were covering the conflict at the time of their deaths, but CPJ has included them in our count as we investigate their circumstances. The list is being updated on a regular basis.\nSalama, a Palestinian journalist who worked as a host for the Hamas affiliated Al-Aqsa TV channel, was killed with his family in an Israeli airstrike on his home in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, according to several media reports, the Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate, and the Turkish owned Anadolu Agency.\nCPJ wasn’t immediately able to specify the number of family members killed with Salama.

He was particularly interested in the daily life stories of the Gazans, despite the siege on Gaza, the corruption, and the narrow political interests in the strip. When the war started, we started collaborating, and he wrote 3 pieces, but he lived in the north where there was intense bombing, and one of the Israeli airstrikes hit his parents’ house, which killed one of his brothers and all of his family members.”\nSharrouf told CPJ that “Atallah evacuated after surviving a lot of near-death situations. In his last correspondence with us, he told me that he’s safe and he wants to resume working soon, but I later learned about his death from the news.” Sharrouf added, “Mohammed was a very professional journalist. He wanted to relay the voices of the people. He worked hard on his pieces and was very keen on factual reporting of the daily life of Gaza’s people, despite all the challenges that a journalist like him faces. Unfortunately, he was killed before he got to do what he wanted in journalism; and the most horrific heartbreaking part was that he thought he would survive.”\nEl-Ruwagh, a Palestinian journalist who worked as a host for the Hamas-affiliated Al-Aqsa Voice Radio, was killed in an Israeli airstrike on Nuseirat camp in northern Gaza, along with four of his children, according to multiple media reports, a tweet by his outlet, the Palestinian Journalists’ Syndicate, and the Beirut-based press freedom group SKeyes.\nEl-Ruwagh was buried on January 26, according to Al-Jazeera.

Over the years, having covered multiple sectors with different dynamics, I developed the ability to connect the dots and become a better portfolio manager.In the hindsight, the journey looks simple and fast, yet it went through a lot of ups and downs, giving me a lifetime of learning. I can resonate with the great investor Charlie Munger, who said, “Nothing has served me better in my long life than continuous learning.” Similarly, I hope to keep on learning every day and become a better investor.What was the one wrong decision that gave you the best-ever learning experience? Was that the best lesson of your life in equity research? As equity markets are forward-looking, and many a times decisions are taken keeping in mind the risk-reward probability. Hence, I would say mistakes get translated into lessons, which helps in future decisions. Without naming any specific situation, I would say mistakes are generally in the form of undermining some regulatory risks or misjudging the management’s ability in capital allocation.As they say, “risk is what's left over after you think you've thought of everything”, one should not take any decisions (in life or investments) at the face value and apart from the basic financial analysis, one needs to be vigilant of the qualitative aspects in the investment field too.Also read: Sebi bars JM Financial from acting as lead manager of any public debt issueHow equity mutual funds can give financial freedom in the long run?Any kind of financial investments potentially gives financial freedom and helps live a more stress-free life. When I come across most women, they either still consider gold investments as the best or just use FDs (fixed deposits) as a means of savings. Some do consider equities but do not know which stock to invest and for how long. For all those women, my advice is to consider mutual funds, which save the pain of stock selection and market timing.For me, equity mutual funds stand out, given the ease of investments, transparency and being tax efficient. However, it depends on individual risk profile which will determine the mix of equity to debt. In short, Mutual Funds sahi hai.Do you think the Union Budget in June-July and the beginning of interest rate cuts later this year are going to be the next key triggers for the market?Assuming the incumbent comes to power, the Street has factored in a growth-oriented budget with continued fiscal discipline. As far as interest rates are concerned, it’s more about the timing of rate cuts which could push the markets higher.Also read: IndiGo co-founder Rakesh Gangwal looks to raise about $450 mn via block dealFor me, it’s more of sustenance of earnings growth, the comeback of private capex, green shoots in consumption spending and supportive regulatory environment that would be the key triggers for the market.Do you think the consistent regulatory actions on the financial services industry can hit the investor sentiment?The regulator would have its reasons and data to back for such regulatory actions.As far as the investor sentiment go, I think they are more impacted by the suddenness of the regulatory action, rather than action itself. However, as long as the regulatory actions are towards strengthening the business practices, investor sentiment will eventually turn positive.Have you changed your bets for FY25 over FY24? Which are the attractive themes for next financial year?The Indian economy stands out, given its higher growth rate versus other major economies. Coming to specific sectors, I believe financials and consumption should continue to drive the growth. Manufacturing too should do well driven by 'Make in India' focus of the government.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

India batted really well in the first two sessions, when we threw a lot at them, but to walk away with them eight down is a helluvan effort. There’s a lot of tired guys in there, and rightly so – they put in a big shift.\n [On Hartley and Bashir] They’re young guys trying to forge their careers. One thing the group has stressed to them is that this is the most exciting time of their careers. You should want to celebrate every wicket and have as much fun as you can with your teammates.\n [Bashir] was ill the day before the game, he wasn’t well yesterday and he’s still a bit iffy today, so to bang out 45 overs and near-enough take a five-for… he’s put in a helluva shift. So have all the bowlers.\n The first thing is to get the two wickets in the morning and then set up some partnerships. India showed us that once you did get in on this wicket you can build partnerships. That’s what we need to look for. It’s exciting: it’s an opportunity for a few guys to rack up some big runs.\nSports quiz of the weekHere’s something to do while you wait for Ali Martin’s match report.Shubman Gill’s reaction\n [On his father] It was his dream to see me play at this level. I’m thinking of him and I’m sure he’ll be proud of me today.\n [On hitting Jimmy Anderson back over his head for six] I thought the ball wasn’t doing much at that time. Instinctively I wanted to go over the top to put some pressure on him.\n I missed out on a big one day. The ball I got out to, I didn’t sight it properly. But apart from that I’m feeling good and hopefully I’ll be able to convert these starts into the big ones.\n [What did you and Jimmy Anderson say to each other?] I think it would be better for both of us to keep that private!\nThat was a pretty good day of Test cricket: 90 overs, 338 runs, eight wickets. It didn’t feel like a contest, but it was rich in moments and stories. Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill made beautiful, occasionally disdainful centuries; Ben Stokes took a wicket with his first ball is almost nine months; Devdutt Padikkal made a serene 65 debut; Sarfaraz Khan entertained everyone royally with a rapid 56; and the impressive Shoaib Bashir and Tom Hartley induced a mini-collapse after tea.Stumps: India lead by 255 runs120th over: India 473-8 (Kuldeep 27, Bumrah 19) Wood can’t get past Bumrah in the final over of the day. The ease with which this ninth-wicket pair have added 45 will give England a bit of hope, but realistically this match should end tomorrow.119th over: India 472-8 (Kuldeep 27, Bumrah 18) Bashir bowls his final over of another very long day at school – and he should have been rewarded with his fifth wicket. Kuldeep was dropped by Stokes, a tough diving chance at gully after he bottom-edged a sweep onto the boot. Root at slip would have had a much simpler catch, but Stokes instinctively dived across.Kuldeep adds some sodium chloride by sweeping emphatically for four, after which Stokes effs and jeffs with frustration. That’s the end of another good day for Bashir, better than figures of 44-5-170-4 might suggest.“If Anderson is marooned here on 699 wickets, he could do worse than consider becoming bowling’s ‘answer’ to Bradman’s 99.94 batting average,” says Darryl Accone. “Imagine walking away just one short of 700! The legend and the lore would grow and grow. Seven hundred? Pah!”118th over: India 467-8 (Kuldeep 23, Bumrah 17) Mark Wood can’t help himself. Lost cause, long day, crap day - but he comes back for more right at the end.The first delivery, which Bumrah pushes stylishly for four, doesn’t do much for his joie de vivre. Wood starts to rev up as the over progresses and beats Bumrah outside off stump with a bit of extra zing.A quick single leads to a run-out chance, but Pope can’t pick the ball up on the run.Got to love Bumrah's attitude to batting. Even here, constantly trying to get better.— Harsha Bhogle (@bhogleharsha) March 8, 2024\nYou could easily replace ‘batting’ with ‘life’. That’s the thing about happy-go-lucky geniuses: we’re infectious they’re as rare as hen’s teeth.117th over: India 462-8 (Kuldeep 23, Bumrah 12) A maiden from Bashir to Kuldeep, who defends with impressive certainty. This is the third consecutive innings in which he has reached 20, a nice detail to go with all those wickets. I do hope this isn’t a brief high in an unfulfilled Test career because he is a bowler of rare brilliance. You’d expect him to become the main spinner when Jadeja and Ashwin retire, though he’s already 29.116th over: India 462-8 (Kuldeep 23, Bumrah 12) With the match drifting, there’s an argument for bringing back Mark Wood in place of Tom Hartley. I don’t think it’s going to happen tonight; after another quiet over from Hartley, there are 24 balls remaining.115th over: India 461-8 (Kuldeep 22, Bumrah 12) India continue to potter their way into the distance. A graphic on the TV coverage shows that Bashir’s average speed has been 5kph lower since lunch, which explains his greater success. Working out the best speed for different pitches is such an intriguing skill, another thing Shane Warne was brilliant at.114th over: India 460-8 (Kuldeep 21, Bumrah 12) There’s no sign of India pushing for a declaration. Maybe they’ve been spooked by the first Test in Hyderabad, or maybe they’re just enjoy the feel of England’s throat against the sole of their boot. Never mind winning the game; a lead of 242 may be enough to win it by an innings.113th over: India 457-8 (Kuldeep 19, Bumrah 11) Ben Stokes considers a review when Bashir has an LBW appeal against Kuldeep turned down. Eventually he decides against it, rightly concluding there was an inside edge. Had it been pad first it would have been close.“Reversing the batting order (109th over) now and again is a standard in club cricket,” says John Starbuck, “but has it ever been done in Tests?”It happened in the days of sticky dogs – not a full reversal, but moving the best players down the order. The most famous example inevitably involved Don Bradman, a story told here with Andy Bull’s usual majesty.112th over: India 456-8 (Kuldeep 19, Bumrah 11) 111th over: India 455-8 (Kuldeep 17, Bumrah 11) Bumrah just manages to keep out a good ball from Bashir that keeps slightly low. Axar Patel is waiting to come on with a drink, which may also contain a message for Bumrah to start swinging. For now he opens the face to guide Bashir past slip for four; that’s a really nicec shot.110th over: India 451-8 (Kuldeep 17, Bumrah 7) Kuldeep has looked composed with the bat ever since his recall. India would love to get him in their team overseas, particularly in Australia later in the year, as he has been their best spinner in this series. Not sure how you do it but these lower-order runs won’t hurt.109th over: India 450-8 (Kuldeep 17, Bumrah 6) Kuldeep and Bumrah are pottering along, no great hurry. Bumrah fiddles Bashir wide of slip for a couple, thrn works a single to bring up the 450. There are 11 overs left today, so there may still be a few overs for England to bat at the end. If so, they should send in Mark Wood and Tom Hartley for a laugh.108th over: India 444-8 (Kuldeep 15, Bumrah 2) Ben Stokes has a dilemma – should he continuing bowling the spinners, who learn a little more with each ball, or give Jimmy Anderson the chance to take his 700th wicket? There is unlikely to be a second Indian innings.There’s also an argument that, rather than bowling Jasprit Bumrah or Mohammad Siraj at the tail end of a 4-1 pasting, Anderson deserves to take his 700th in front of a full house next summer. Oh my god it’s going to be Kraigg Brathwaite again isn’t it?107th over: India 443-8 (Kuldeep 14, Bumrah 2) Murali Kartik, commentating on TV, is lauding Bashir’s unwavering enthusiasm and lust for battle. At tea he had grim figures of 26-4-127-1; since then he has taken 3-26 from 12 overs. Good lad.106th over: India 441-8 (Kuldeep 13, Bumrah 1) Kuldeep, who would be a shoo-in for player of the series were it not for that pesky pair of Jaiswal and Bumrah, sweeps Hartley for four to move into the double figures. Bumrah gets off the mark by clunking just short of mid-on.“All it needs is for Stokes to win this Test and all the obituaries will be converted into coronations,” says Krishnamoorthy V. “That shows the kind of life these sportsmen need to live EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.”Very true, which makes the drastic shortage of empathy in modern society even more… interesting.105th over: India 435-8 (Kuldeep 8, Bumrah 0) Bashir beats Kuldeep with a jaffa, similar to the delivery that bowled Padikkal, then does it again two balls later. For good measure, he beats Bumrah later in the over as well. We shouldn’t get carried away, but we should be excited about what Bashir might achieve in this thing of ours.104th over: India 434-8 (Kuldeep 7, Bumrah 0) “I don’t think this tour has gone too badly,” says Felix Wood. “India are very good, and England did well to even get to positions that they could throw away - and while I’d have preferred they didn’t implode, it’s hard to ignore quite how good India are. England simply havent been good enough with the bat as a team - but looking at their averages that shouldn’t really be a surprise. I wonder how long Pope can hang on for, and I worry that Brook will revert to his career average before his purple patch. There are some big gaps to fill in the team, can we play a game of next cab off the rank to pass the time?”I agree – when the dust has settled and the sneering has stopped, I think history will judge that England’s performance was above par. The frustration comes from the opportunities they had and the unforseeably poor performance of the middle order.Next cab off the rank: which rank are we talking about? I suppose No3 is the position I would be most concerned about. Josh Bohannon is probably the next in line, though I think he batted No4 for England Lions against India A.103rd over: India 433-8 (Kuldeep 6, Bumrah 0) It’s very hard to see this game going to a fourth day now, and if England get a wriggle on it might be over tonight. Stokes cocks up a run-out chance with a weird throw that is well off target. Root, smiling, seems to motion that the ball might have got stuck in the crooked finger.“Getting the odd window of opportunity to catch up on the cricket with the OBO whilst ostensibly teaching in sunny Naples,” says Colum Fordham. “If nothing else, this tough end-of-term Test is giving excellent practice for our young spinners Bashir and Hartley against top batsmen in the subcontinent. Beats a cloudy day in Northampton. Really enjoyed seeing Bashir’s beautiful ball (in my break).”Yep, it’s invaluable. If one of them goes on to make it at Test level, you’d imagine they’ll cite this tour as a crucial rite of passage.102nd over: India 428-8 (Kuldeep 1, Bumrah 0) Those wicket mean Hartley has overtaken Ashwin as the leading wickettaker in the series, 22 to 21, though Ashwin has another innings to come.WICKET! India 428-8 (Ashwin b Hartley 0)Two wickets in the over! Ashwin getse a duck in his 100th Test, and I don’t think he’ll be batting again. He pushed defensively down the wrong line and was gated by a ball that didn’t turn.India's Ravichandran Ashwin looks back after being bowled. Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesDrinksEngland are having a dignified session: in the face of certain defeat, they’ve taken four wickets for 51 in 17 overs.WICKET! India 427-7 (Jadeja LBW b Hartley 15)Tom Hartley roars with delight - and relief - after taking his first wicket. Jadeja pushed around a delivery that turned sharply to hit him on the knee roll in front of off and middle. The umpire gave it out LBW and, though Jadeja reviewed, technology was England’s friend.England's Tom Hartley celebrates with teammates Ben Stokes and Ben Foakes after the dismissal of India's Ravindra Jadeja. Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty ImagesEngland’s wicketkeeper Ben Foakes appeals for a LBW. Photograph: Sajjad Hussain/AFP/Getty Images101st over: India 427-6 (Jadeja 15, Ashwin 0) Shoaib Bashir came into this series with 10 first-class wickets at an average of 67. He’s now one wicket away from consecutive five-fors agianst India.The new batter is Ravichandran Ashwin, who gets a nice ovation to mark his 100th Test.WICKET! India 427-6 (Jurel c Duckett b Bashir 15)Another wicket for this highly impressive young spinner. Jurel charges Bashir and swishes the ball high towards long on, where Duckett steadies himself to take a comfortable catch.Jurel is annoyed with himself as he walks off. Sometimes you eat the bear…100th over: India 426-5 (Jadeja 14, Jurel 15) Jadeja comes down to Hartley, who sees him coming and drags the ball much shorter. Jadeja improvises to bat-pad the ball to safety on the off side. Hartley looks a little tired, and his returns with bat and ball have diminished as the series has progressed, but overall 20 wickets at 39 is a fine effort in the circumstances. And as with Bashir and Rehan, the education is priceless.99th over: India 421-5 (Jadeja 10, Jurel 14) Bashir has an LBW appeal against Jadeja turned down, and again he dismisses talk of a review, this time because of a probable inside edge. That’s such an impressive quality for any bowler to have, never mind a 20-year-old. India lead by 2034.“This is an interesting observation,” says Krishnamoorthy V.Is this the first time ever that four different players are playing in their 100th Test at the same time? Ashwin, Bairstow, Williamson, Southee.— Thejaswi Udupa (@udupendra) March 8, 2024Good point. I think Jacques Kallis, Shaun Pollock and Stephen Fleming all played their 100th Test in the same game but I don’t think four have done so simultaneously.98th over: India 420-5 (Jadeja 9, Jurel 14) Jurel cuts Hartley elegantly for four to move into double figures. The performance of India’s newbies in this series is a little chilling for the rest of world cricket. Okay, the rest of the world cricket apart from Australia, who are dealing with it just fine.97th over: India 414-5 (Jadeja 8, Jurel 9) Bashir has taken plenty of tap in this innings, including eight sixes, but his puppy-dog enthusiasm has never waned. He bowls another good over, mainly to Jadeja, and there’s one run from it. This is an incredibly valuable education.“Of the three young spinners on this tour, I am interested in the fact that Rehan Ahmed - before the tour - commented that he sees himself primarily as a batter who bowls,” says Mark Slater. “The future would indeed be bright if he could establish himself as an all-rounder in the team, especially if his ability to score runs would cancel out the usual habit of leggies being expensive. Of the other two, it might come down to whether Hartley’s better batting will keep out Bashir’s fantastic action to accompany Rehan. Personally, I would love to have all three operating in England in a few years’ time along with a couple of seamers (Jimmy?) plus a batter who turns over some military medium.”Somewhere up above, Ray Illingworth is nodding with approval.96th over: India 413-5 (Jadeja 8, Jurel 8) Both Jadeja and Jurel are taking time to get their eye in. India have lots of time, more than three days of the stuff.“There’s a debate ongoing in my cricket WhatsApp about the closeness of this series,” says Max Williams. “I fear a 4-1 which will include two almighty thrashings weakens the case for the defensive. Yet in the 4th Test, we’re 180 ahead on a tough batting surface with three wickets to take – surely you win from that position 8 or 9 times out of 10. At that point, even if we get slaughtered in the decider, the team emerges with immense credit. There’s also the argument that we’re one Ollie Pope innings away from 5-0 and abject humiliation...”Nuance lives! My instinct is that 4-1 is a par score but England’s performance has been slightly better than expected. It’s really complicated, though, not least because the Bazball Wars mean there are two different areas of criticism: approach and performance. That’s always been the case to some extent, though it has been amplified in this era of English cricket.95th over: India 412-5 (Jadeja 8, Jurel 7) “If England had a B team, would Liam Dawson finally get a game?” says Victor Manley. “The other problem is, I expect India could also field a pretty competitive C team, and perhaps even D. How far down the ranks would we have to go before, say, Sri Lanka would give them a game? India Q?”That’s a good and slightly scary point. And unlike the 1980s West Indies and 1990s Australia, they have frightening depth in every position.94th over: India 410-5 (Jadeja 7, Jurel 6) Hartley replaces Root as there’s a right-hander at the crease now. Jurel cuts his first ball for four thanks to a sloppy misfield from Crawley, who chunters angrily at himself.93rd over: India 406-5 (Jadeja 7, Jurel 2) This match may determine whether Hartley or Bashir play for England next summer. I think Bashir is edging ahead of Hartley and Rehan, so it could depend on a) Jack Leach’s fitness and b) how England balance the present, the future and their sense of loyalty to Leach.WICKET! India 403-5 (Padikkal b Bashir 64)Every cloud has a silver lining; England’s is Shoaib Bashir. He has just bowled Padikkal with a gorgeous delivery from around the wicket. It curved onto the stumps and straightened sharply to beat Padikkal’s defensive push and hit the off stump.Padikkal made an accomplished, clear-headed 65 on debut. India A have found another one!India’s Devdutt Padikkal is bowled out by England’s Shoaib Bashir. Photograph: Adnan Abidi/Reuters92nd over: India 403-4 (Padikkal 65, Jadeja 6) Root skids one on to hit Padikkal on the pad. He instinctively turns to appeal for LBW, but after his body has moved approximately 135 degrees his brain registers that it would have missed leg.The DJ celebrates with a blast of It Wasn’t Me by Shaggy.91st over: India 400-4 (Padikkal 63, Jadeja 5) India’s top five have all reached fifty in this innings. The last time that happened in a Test against England was at the Oval in 2001, a real funfest for England fans. Australia 641-4 dec (S Waugh 157* on one leg, M Waugh 120, Langer 102*, Hayden 68, Martyn 64*, Ponting 62)Patiddar nods respectfully after playing and missing at a fine delivery from Bashir, then taps a single to bring up India’s 400. The match is over but we’re all contractually obliged to be here unti the end so don’t even think about it.90th over: India 399-4 (Padikkal 62, Jadeja 5) With two left-handers at the crease, Root replaces Hartley. He’s milked for four runs, and the over is done in about 150 seconds.“I’ve been thinking about two India teams for a while now,” says Deepak Puri. “Rather than an India team vs an India A team I’d go N India vs S India, or W India vs E India. You’d know the squads then and there would be no problems with players wanting to graduate from the A team to the full team. Perhaps not though, it’s a bit hubristic.”Yes, in practical terms I doubt it would work but it would be so much fun. I loved watching England lose to Australia A in 1994-95.89th over: India 395-4 (Padikkal 60, Jadeja 3) One run from a nice Bashir over. Here’s a question: of the three young England spinners on this tour, who will (not who should) play the most Tests? Right now Bashir looks the best of the three. He’s also the weakest batter, though, and he’s not a wristspinner.I guess it’s a blank canvas, as it was for the four England debutants at Trent Bridge in 1993. They had their whole lives ahead of them. Those lives have included two Test caps for Mark Lathwell, three for Martin McCague, five for Mark Ilott and 100 for Graham Thorpe.88th over: India 394-4 (Padikkal 60, Jadeja 2) A double misfield from Bashir and Crawley allows Padikkal to get four more off Hartley. “There’s a definite end-of-tour feel against Engnaldn today,” says Graeme Swann on commentary, although he does so with empathy rather than entitlement. Paddikar classily cuts another boundary later in the over.87th over: India 386-4 (Padikkal 52, Jadeja 2) Padikkal reaches a debut half-century in swaggering style, launching Bashir back over his head for six. It’s an even more eye-catching stroke because of how serenely he has played until that point. This generation of Indian batsmen have a scary level of confidence and certainty. The Kohli generation aren’t exactly Mark Corrigans either.86th over: India 379-4 (Padikkal 45, Jadeja 2) It’s spin at both ends, with Tom Hartley returning ot the attack, so Jimmy Anderson will have to wait for his 700th wicket.85th over: India 377-4 (Padikkal 44, Jadeja 1)WICKET! India 376-4 (Sarfaraz c Root b Bashir 56)Blimey, a wicket straight after tea! Sarfaraz opened his face and steered Bashir’s first ball straight to Joe Root at slip. I think some extra bounce undid Sarfaraz, maybe a bit of drift too, so that’s a nice wicket for Bashir to take – especially as it came with the new ball.I haven’t thought this through, at all, but should we consider adding India A to the World Test Championship? Instinct says no, everything says no really, but just imagine India v India A.Tea: India lead by 158That was another draining session for England, despite the best efforts of Ben Stokes’ scriptwriter. He bowled Rohit Sharma with his first ball since June, a laughable jaffa, and Jimmy Anderson cleaned up Shubman Gill soon after.The new boys, Devdutt Padikkal and Sarfaraz Khan, soaked up the pressure and then put it back on England with a classy, confident partnership of 97 from 21.4 overs. It was exemplary cricket from a frighteningly good team.84th over: India 376-3 (Padikkal 44, Sarfaraz Khan 56) Anderson continues to hunt his 700th wicket, an achievement that is almost beyond comprehension. Sarfaraz gets two bonus runs when a futile direct hit, I think from Bairstow, ricochets past the man backing up. That’s tea.83rd over: India 373-3 (Padikkal 44, Sarfaraz Khan 53) A fairly harmless over from Bashir. England started the afternoon session well but India have restored ordure in the second hour: 12 overs, 58 runs, no wickets.As Nick Knight says on commentary, Sarfaraz’s innings has not just been about the exhilarating strokeplay. He did his due diligence at the start, especially against Mark Wood. He just looks a fantastic player, with lightning-fast hands, feet and brain.The next 18 months – Australia away, England away – will tell us where he stands on the TendulKambli scale, assuming he can get into the team.

Photo credit: Golden Boy Promotions/Getty Images\n Ryan Garcia has claimed he was sexually abused as a child and has pictures of a “real alien” is his latest rambling posts to social media.\nThere are serious concerns about the state of mind of the 25-year-old Los Angelan who just last week was on a press tour to promote his upcoming fight against WBC junior welterweight champion Devin Haney 31-0 (15) at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York on April 20.\nA disturbing post to Garcia’s Instagram and X accounts on Sunday said his “throat had been slit” and was followed by satanic commentary. The following day Garcia claimed his accounts had been hacked.\nSan Franciscan Haney, 25, isn’t buying in to the idea that Garcia has lost the plot. He believes it is a poor attempt at mind games.\n“Give Ryan an Oscar [award], please,” Haney posted to X. “This is all an act y’all. The fight is happening on April 20th. He’s just playing crazy to ‘sell it,’ which is weird because there are people out there who are actually crazy, but he’s just acting for attention.”\nNow World Boxing News is reporting that the latest series of posts from Garcia are perhaps the most troubling yet.\n“I feel like crying because I’m giving everyone info they already know, but they refuse to believe. Do you want proof now I’ll get it ASAP!” said Garcia 24-1 (20) on social media.\n“Have I proved I don’t care about fame or money? Even tho bags are flying in. I’m going to set up a live drug test.\n“I’ve been raped at two years old. How would you act [if it was done] by a family member? How would that feel to you, and how would you act?\n“It’s funny to people. I was raped as a two-year-old, and I have proof, and they laugh. WTF is wrong with people?\n“I’ve seen the worst shit in my life. I’m tired of being quiet.”\n“What would you do if they held you down and made you watch? Yeah, I’m losing it. The shit I’ve seen, I’m hurting for the kids. Human trafficking is the biggest trade in the world. I’m hurting for them, and I’m the crazy one. No one is doing anything.\n“I can’t be touched unless God allows it. Behold The Great Awakening! Didn’t think it would come from me. Did you?”\nGarcia continued: “I have a picture of a real alien. Should I release this and fuck it all up?\n“They held me down and made me watch. Of course, I’ve lost it a little. They really begged me to join, and I said fuck you.\n“Are you guys the crazy ones? Because I’m not lying. They are hurting kids! And everyone is standing back, telling me to shut up. I don’t care anymore.\n“I’ll die for innocent souls taken if you aren’t on my side. You are on the devil’s side.”\nOver the weekend Garcia’s ex-wife Andrea Celina, who is also the mother of his two children, issued a statement: “I’m genuinely concerned and so is [sic] all his family members.

What happens if you stop?","byline":"By The Associated Press","excerpt":"Doctors who treat obesity stress that the disease is a chronic condition that must be managed indefinitely, like heart disease or high blood pressure.","textContent":"Millions of Americans who have dropped pounds and boosted their health using popular obesity drugs like Wegovy are facing a new dilemma: What happens if they stop taking them?Many worry, rightly, that they’ll regain weight and revert to old habits. In clinical trials, patients who paused the drugs put back on most of the weight they lost.But others are gambling on a do-it-yourself strategy to ease off the drugs and stay slim by stretching out doses, taking the medication intermittently or stopping and starting again only if needed.“To me, it’s a help, it’s an aid,” said Donna Cooper, 62, of Front Royal, Virginia, who lost nearly 40 pounds in nine months using Wegovy along with diet and exercise. “At some point you have to come off of them. I don’t want to be on them forever.”More than 3 million prescriptions for the new medications are dispensed each month in the U.S., according to recent data from the health technology company IQVIA. They include semaglutide, the drug in Ozempic and Wegovy, and tirzepatide, the drug in Mounjaro and Zepbound.But many people don’t stick with it. One recent study published in the journal Obesity found that just 40% of patients who filled a prescription for Wegovy in 2021 or 2022 were still taking it a year later.Doctors who treat obesity stress that the disease is a chronic condition that must be managed indefinitely, like heart disease or high blood pressure. The new injection drugs work by mimicking hormones in the gut and the brain to regulate appetite and feelings of fullness. They were designed — and tested — to be taken continuously, experts said.“We are not an injection shop,” said Dr. Andres Acosta, an obesity researcher and medical adviser at the Mayo Clinic. “I don’t think they should be used in intermittent fashion. It’s not approved for that. They don’t work like that.”Despite that directive, some patients who achieved their health and weight goals with the drugs are looking for an off-ramp, said Dr. Amy Rothberg, a University of Michigan endocrinologist who directs a weight-management and diabetes treatment program.“Many of them want to step down or de-escalate their dose,” she said. “And they’re also wanting to ultimately discontinue the medication.”Donna Cooper holds up a dosage of Wegovy, a drug used for weight loss, at her home in Front Royal, Va., on March 1. “To me, it’s a help, it’s an aid,” says Cooper, 62, who lost nearly 40 pounds in nine months using Wegovy along with diet and exercise. “At some point you have to come off of them. I don’t want to be on them forever.\"Amanda Andrade-Rhoades / AP'Taking a breather'The reasons for pausing the drugs can vary, said Dr. Katherine Saunders, an obesity expert at Weill Cornell Medicine and co-founder of the obesity treatment company Intellihealth. Some patients don’t like side effects such as nausea and constipation. Others want to stop for holidays or special occasions — or just because they don’t want to take the weekly shots indefinitely.One of Saunders’ patients, a 53-year-old New York man, lost 70 pounds last year using Mounjaro. He told Saunders he wanted to take “a breather” from the medication to see how his body reacted. On her advice, he has been stretching out injections to every 10 days or two weeks, instead of weekly, since December.Other patients have been forced to ration or halt doses because the drugs are costly — $1,000 to $1,300 per month — and insurance coverage varies or because demand has far outstripped supply, Rothberg noted.“It’s being imposed on them,” she said. “By necessity they have to go off the medication and kind of figure it out.”But hoping the drugs’ benefits will last even after stopping them ignores the fundamental biology of obesity, experts said. The disease affects the way the body processes and stores energy, causing it to accumulate weight. The new drugs alter that process and when patients stop, the disease returns, often with a vengeance.Many people dropping off the medications report a sharp rise in symptoms of obesity. They include so-called food noise or intrusive thoughts of food; raging hunger; and decreased feelings of fullness when they eat.“These drugs are just a super-suppressor of these native signals,” Rothberg said. “And we should expect that’s going to occur.”Tara Rothenhoefer, 48, of Trinity, Florida, lost more than 200 pounds after joining a clinical trial for Mounjaro nearly four years ago. She now takes the lowest dose of the drug every four to eight weeks, but she worries when her weight fluctuates by a few pounds.“It scares the daylights out of me to see the numbers on the scale going up,” she said.Some patients who stop the drugs and start again find they can’t tolerate the medication, winding up with severe gastrointestinal side effects, Acosta said. Others find the drugs don’t work as well when they restart them, Saunders added. But there’s no data on the long-term effects of intermittent use.“I don’t think it’s a strategy that will work for most individuals, but it could be an option for select patients,” Saunders said.Donna Cooper has heard that people gain back weight when they stop the drugs, but she hopes to be an exception. She’s on her last box of Wegovy injections. Once she’s done, Cooper said she’ll just continue with a strict diet and exercise plan.I just needed a crutch to get everything back in order,” said Cooper, who has gone from a size 16 to a size 10. “And I am excited to be done.\"","length":5459,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,8,7,6,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides a thorough exploration of the implications of stopping weight-loss drugs like Wegovy, highlighting both patient experiences and expert opinions.

The safe landing highlighted the professionalism of the flight crew and the robust safety features of the aircraft. No injuries were reported among the passengers or crew, showcasing the effectiveness of emergency protocols in aviation.The incident also spotlighted the importance of routine maintenance checks. United Airlines assured that their maintenance team had recently serviced the aircraft, and the sudden detachment of the wheel was an unexpected event that will be thoroughly investigated to prevent future occurrences.Video Evidence Sparks Maintenance DebateA video that went viral online shows the wheel plummeting from the aircraft, stirring discussions about the maintenance practices of airlines. John Cox, a retired pilot, referred to the incident as a maintenance issue, suggesting that the responsibility lies with United’s maintenance team rather than Boeing. This perspective has been echoed by others in the industry.However, the incident has not gone unnoticed by the public and aviation authorities. There is an ongoing conversation about the need for stringent maintenance checks and better oversight to ensure such mishaps do not endanger lives.Boeing’s Design ResilienceUnited Airlines confirmed that the Boeing 777’s design allows it to land safely even with a wheel missing. The aircraft’s main landing struts, each equipped with six wheels, provide redundancy to handle such situations. This design aspect is a testament to the aviation industry’s commitment to safety and the prevention of single points of failure.Alan Price, a former chief pilot for Delta Air Lines, highlighted the aircraft’s remaining tires’ capability to bear the load. This resilience is part of the stringent requirements for commercial aircraft, ensuring they can withstand a range of emergency scenarios.Boeing’s Ongoing Quality Control ChallengesThe wheel detachment event comes amid a series of quality control issues for Boeing. In January, a panel blew off a Boeing 737 Max 9, leading to a temporary grounding of the model. These incidents have put Boeing under intense scrutiny, with calls for improved quality control measures.Recently, US regulators have given Boeing 90 days to develop a plan to address these shortcomings. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has demanded substantial improvements, emphasizing the need for Boeing to prioritize quality and safety in its operations.Flight DetailsIncident SummaryResponse and SafetyUnited Airlines Boeing 777Wheel detaches after takeoff, damages carsEmergency landing; no injuries reportedRoute: San Francisco to JapanRedirected to Los AngelesBoeing 777 design allows safe landingPassengers aboard: 249Maintenance issue citedInvestigation and review of maintenance protocolsThe United Airlines plane makes an emergency landing after a wheel falls off during takeoff, serving as a stark reminder of the importance of aircraft maintenance and the resilience of modern aviation design.

The oven then shows the recommended Precision Cooking Mode on the LCD touchscreen, and — assuming it's right — you just tap it to get it cooking. The oven then automatically tracks the food’s progress and can modify temperatures and adjust cook times as needed, according to GE Appliances.Select GE Appliances wall ovens will soon work with Cookcam AI. For dual wall ovens, the feature works in the top oven. Image: GE AppliancesInitially, Cookcam AI will only work for five dishes — turkey, cookies, pizza, cakes, and brownies. GE Appliances says it plans to roll out more updates. “We are just getting started and look forward to continuing to introduce more food types in the future,” said Rachael Schwartz, executive director of product management and built-in cooking at GE Appliances.How useful this function will be remains to be seen, but it’s a step toward more intelligence in our appliances that could lead to a smarter, more helpful kitchen. Food recognition is not new — it was a core function of the excellent but now discontinued June Oven. Samsung recently introduced a similar feature called AI Pro Cooking to its Bespoke wall oven, which also uses a camera and optimizes cooking settings while monitoring food.But while the Samsung oven can recognize 80 different dishes and ingredients compared to GE Appliances’ five, you have to buy a whole new oven to get Samsung’s features.

Morningstar chief US market strategist Dave Sekera includes Duke Energy among his stock picks in 3 Stocks to Sell and 3 Stocks to Buy in March, too.Duke Energy is one of the largest regulated utilities in the United States. Florida is Duke’s most constructive and attractive jurisdiction, with higher-than-average load growth and best-in-class regulation that allows for higher-than-average returns on equity, forward-looking rates, and automatic base rate adjustments. In North Carolina, Duke’s largest service territory, the outlook has improved significantly. Legislation allows for multiyear rate plans, including rate increases for projected capital investments. Indiana remains constructive, allowing recovery for investments for renewable energy and future recovery on and of investments for coal ash remediation, with a forward-looking test year. Duke’s $73 billion capital investment plan for 2024-28 is focused on clean energy as the company works toward net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and net zero methane emissions by 2030. Management sees growth opportunities beyond its five-year forecast.Key Morningstar Metrics for Duke EnergyEconomic Moat RatingDuke’s regulatory environment is consistent with its peers and is supported by better-than-average economic fundamentals in its key regions. These factors contribute to the returns Duke has earned and have led to a constructive working relationship with regulators, the most critical component of a regulated utility’s moat. State and federal regulators typically grant regulated utilities exclusive rights to charge customers rates that allow the utilities to earn a fair return on and return of the capital they invest to build, operate, and maintain their distribution networks. The risk of adverse regulatory decisions precludes regulated utilities from earning wide economic moat ratings. However, the threat of material value destruction is low, and normalized returns exceed costs of capital in most cases, leaving us comfortable assigning narrow moats to many regulated utilities.Read more about Duke’s moat rating.Fair Value Estimate for Duke StockOur fair value estimate is $112 per share. Our annual earnings growth forecast is at the top end of management’s 5%-7% guidance. Duke’s pipeline of growth opportunities, continued management of operating expenses, and constructive regulatory outcomes support our forecast. We don’t expect a material change in companywide average allowed returns. We expect Duke will continue to benefit from constructive regulatory rate increases to support its investment. In our discounted cash flow valuation, we use a 5.9% cost of capital based on a 7.5% cost of equity. This is lower than the 9% rate of return we expect investors will demand from a diversified equity portfolio, reflecting Duke’s lower sensitivity to the economic cycle and lower degree of operating leverage.Read more about Duke’s fair value estimate.Risk and UncertaintyRegulatory risk is the key uncertainty, particularly given Duke’s significant investment planned for the next several years. Much of the company’s success hinges on the relationships it has built. Duke’s regulatory exposure is diversified due to operations in multiple constructive jurisdictions. Duke faces environmental, social, and governance risk, particularly given its relatively large coal fleet. Tightening environmental regulations could require significant capital investment or added operating costs. While we think natural gas will remain the primary source for heating in Duke’s service areas for the foreseeable future, there is risk that policymakers expedite the shift away from natural gas. An inflationary environment and rising interest rates would raise borrowing costs and make other investments more attractive than regulated utilities for income-seeking investors.Read more about Duke’s risk and uncertainty.Duke Bulls SayDuke’s regulated utilities provide a stable source of earnings. The company’s large capital expenditure plan should drive rate base and earnings growth for the next several years.The company operates in constructive regulatory jurisdictions, supporting capital investment growth.Duke’s management team has focused on core regulated operations and moaty growth investments.Duke Bears SayEquity issuances and capital investment delays have hurt management’s relationships with key stakeholders.Duke’s aggressive investment plan increases regulatory risk.As with all regulated utilities, rising interest rates will raise financing costs and could make the dividend less attractive for income investors. 3 Stocks to Sell and 3 Stocks to Buy in March This article was compiled by Susan Dziubinski and Sylvia Hauser.The author or authors do not own shares in any securities mentioned in this article.","length":5220,"publishedTime":"2024-03-06T20:37:20.87Z","rating":[8,7,9,7,8,8,6],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about Duke Energy, highlighting its position in the market, growth potential, regulatory environments, and key metrics like economic moat rating and fair value estimate.

Our focus has been on ensuring access to care and medications by addressing challenges to pharmacy, medical claims and payment systems targeted by the attack.\"We are committed to providing relief for people affected by this malicious attack on the U.S. health system,\" said Andrew Witty, CEO of UnitedHealth Group. \"All of us at UnitedHealth Group feel a deep sense of responsibility for recovery and are working tirelessly to ensure that providers can care for their patients and run their practices, and that patients can get their medications. We’re determined to make this right as fast as possible.\"Based on our ongoing investigation, there is no indication that any other UnitedHealth Group systems have been affected by this attack.To address the needs of our customers, the company is announcing the following immediate actions:Timeline to Restore Change Healthcare SystemsWe are working aggressively on the restoration of our systems and services. Assuming we continue at our current rate of progress, we expect our key system functionality to be restored and available on the following timelines:Pharmacy services: Electronic prescribing is now fully functional with claim submission and payment transmission also available as of today. We have taken action to make sure patients can access their medicines in the meantime, including Optum Rx pharmacies sending members their medications based on the date needed.Payments platform: Electronic payment functionality will be available for connection beginning March 15.Medical claims: We expect to begin testing and reestablish connectivity to our claims network and software on March 18, restoring service through that week.While we work to restore these systems, we strongly recommend our provider and payer clients use the applicable workarounds we have established—in particular, using our new iEDI claim submission system in the interest of system redundancy given the current environment.Continued Funding Support for Community-Based ProvidersOn March 1, Optum launched a Temporary Funding Assistance Program to help bridge the gap in short-term cash flow needs for providers who received payments from payers that were processed by Change Healthcare.UnitedHealthcare will provide further funding solutions for its provider partners. This applies to medical, dental and vision providers and will involve advancing funds each week representing the difference between their historical payment levels and the payment levels post attack. Advances will not need to be repaid until claims flows have fully resumed. Providers must complete a one-time registration to access funding.We urge all payers to do the same as this is the fastest, most efficient way to address provider short-term cash flow needs. UnitedHealthcare does not have visibility to the extent of business interruption for each provider; therefore, it is necessary for other payers to participate in a similar manner.We recognize these programs will not work for everyone. Beyond UnitedHealthcare’s provider funding relief, Optum is expanding its funding program to include providers who have exhausted all available connection options, and who work with a payer who has opted not to advance funds to providers during the period when Change Healthcare systems remain down.This expansion is a funding mechanism of last resort, especially for small and regional providers, and will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. An Optum Pay account is required to complete registration and to receive funds and repay funds. Use your existing Optum Pay account or sign up for Optum Pay to login.For those who receive funding support, there are no fees, interest or other associated costs with the assistance. For repayment, providers will receive an invoice once standard payment operations resume and will have 30 days to return the funds. These terms now apply to both the original and expanded funding programs.To determine eligibility and funding amount, please register for the program at the website: www.optum.com/temporaryfunding.Additional Consumer ActionsFor Medicare Advantage plans, including Dual Special Needs Plans, we are temporarily suspending prior authorizations for most outpatient services except for Durable Medical Equipment, cosmetic procedures and Part B step therapies. We also are temporarily suspending utilization review for MA inpatient admissions.For Medicare Part D pharmacy benefits, we are temporarily suspending drug formulary exception review processes.These actions will remain in place until March 31. We will work with state Medicaid agencies on any actions they wish to implement.Prescription SupportAs of today, all major pharmacy claims and payment systems are back up and functioning. We have taken action to make sure patients can access their medicines in the meantime, including Optum Rx pharmacies sending members their medications based on the date needed.Additionally, recognizing that we were asking pharmacies to take action to help patients, Optum Rx PBM notified network pharmacy partners and pharmacy associations that we would reimburse all appropriate pharmacy claims filled with the good faith understanding that a medication would be covered. We continue to focus on those remaining areas of pharmacy disruption, including specialty coupon programs and certain claims for infusion providers.For more information and access to all solutions provided by UnitedHealth Group, visit http://www.uhg.com/changehealthcarecyberresponse.The company expects to exclude the principal impacts arising as a result of the cyberattack from adjusted earnings.About UnitedHealth GroupUnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone through two distinct and complementary businesses.

This move is part of an ongoing process, with other applicants at various stages of the licensing process.\nHowever, this means majority of borrowers may still be exploited by the unregistered predatory digital lenders, despite the Central Bank of Kenya’s push to regulate the sector, now that more than 430 pending applications are unlicensed and still in business. \nThe country’s apex bank introduced the Central Bank of Kenya (Amendment) Act, 2021, which came into effect on December 23, 2021.\nThe Act aims to regulate the digital sector, improve business models, protect consumers, foster economic growth, promote financial inclusion, and spur technology investment.\nThe decision to license and oversee DCPs was driven by public concerns about the predatory practices of unregulated DCPs, CBK said. These concerns included high costs, unethical debt collection practices, and personal information abuse.\nSince March 2022, the CBK has received 480 applications and has been actively working with applicants to review their applications. \nCBK says the new applicants are “at different stages of the process, largely awaiting the submission of requisite files”.  The review process involves engaging with other regulators and agencies, including the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner, to ensure adherence to relevant laws and safeguard customer interests.\nCentral Bank said the focus of the engagements has been inter alia on business models, consumer protection and fitness and propriety of proposed shareholders, directors, and management.\n“This is to ensure adherence to the relevant laws and importantly that the interests of customers are safeguarded. We acknowledge the efforts of the applicants and the support of other regulators and agencies in this process,” the statement noted.\nBefore the Act, digital credit providers caused significant distress among Kenyans due to exorbitant interest rates and challenging loan repayment terms.\nUnethical practices such as debt shaming, misuse of borrowers’ personal data, and potential privacy breaches led to reputational damage and identity theft risks.\nThese challenges saw the Senate Finance Committee seek answers from CBK on whether it had put up firewalls to cushion users from predatory lending and whether the regulator had reined in on entities abusing the law. This after it emerged that most of the lenders were unregulated exposing borrowers to exploitation.\nSenate’s inquiry was triggered by petitions on four micro-lending entities imposing huge interests against the provisions of the Digital Credit Providers Regulations of 2022. The new Act has brought much-needed regulation to this sector.\nDigital lenders, known for higher rates than traditional banks, are expected to adjust their pricing models under these regulations.\nWhile these measures aim to curb unethical practices, their effectiveness in completely stopping harassment by digital lenders is yet to be widely felt. With the new regulations in place, the landscape of digital lending in Kenya is set to change, promising a more secure and fair environment for borrowers.\n The new firms include Autocheck, Azura, Chapeo, Chime, Creditarea, Decimal, Dexintec, Factorhouse, Fezotech and Fortune.\nOthers are Lipa Later, Lobelitec, Maralal Ledger, Marble Capital, MKM Capital, Pi Capital, Senti Capital, Ubapesa and Zillions Credit.","length":3657,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T05:15:00+03:00","rating":[7,6,8,6,7,7,6],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the Central Bank of Kenya's licensing of new Digital Credit Providers (DCPs) and the ongoing efforts to regulate the digital lending sector.

But the father of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution that founded the Soviet Union — and the 100th anniversary of his passing — have largely been ignored by ordinary Russians.","textContent":"Egyptian Engineer Mohamed Ahmed, 40, was on annual leave abroad with his family in July 2021 when he received an email from an official in the administration of his 7-year-old son's school, informing him of the need to \"communicate immediately for an urgent and important matter.\"\nIn remarks to Asharq Al-Awsat, the man said he was surprised by the urgency of the message, especially as his son was with him on his vacation. When he contacted the school administration, the official told him that they had received warning letters accompanied by a picture of his son that included “accusations and abuse against the family and the child, as well as extremely serious health allegations against them,” which usually cause stigma in Arab societies.\nBetween the Arab country, where engineer Mohamed Ahmed works (and still does), and his birthplace in Egypt (from where it was later proven that those messages were issued, and the judicial authorities accused a woman of being behind them), the man lived through episodes of cross-border crimes, including “death threats, financial blackmail, defamation, insults and slander”, which took him nearly 10 years to prove.\nBut the man is not a single case. Asharq Al-Awsat investigated similar crimes and documented them by interviewing the victims, reviewing official investigations, attending trials, hearing the testimonies of activists and verifying incidents that took place in more than 5 countries, most of them in the Arab region, as well as victims from other Arab countries who later declined to participate in the investigation, for fear of stigma, despite their initial approval.\nThe investigation reveals that the perpetrators relied on “being outside the borders of the country” where the crime took place, using “long electronic arms,” and taking advantage of “the difficulty of prosecution.”\n\"The investigation reveals that the perpetrators relied on being outside the borders of the country where the crime took place, using long electronic arms, and taking advantage of the difficulty of prosecution.\"\nThe investigation also shows exploitation of a loophole represented by “the absence of a specialized regional executive entity (Arab at least), for the effective deterrence, prosecution, and exchange of information in transnational cyber-extortion crimes,” according to activists and officials in several countries, despite the presence of an “Arab Convention to Combat Information Technology Crimes” dating back to 2010, ratified by 11 countries.\nEng. Ahmed was “shocked” that the blackmail he was subjected to since 2013 extended to his son. His problem began about a decade ago when he received extensive calls from relatives and friends stating that they had received messages (via Facebook) containing “insults, slander, and defamation” related to his person. He recalls: “My acquaintances were embarrassed to inform me of the messages because of the low quality and ugly language.”\nThe man was an “ideal victim,” as he put it, and says that the perpetrator “took advantage on my residence outside the country, as well as my inability to easily prove that a crime had been committed against me, and that at a time (late 2013) the issue of prosecuting information technology crimes was not common.” He adds sadly: “I remember that I used to receive 50 to 60 calls or messages daily informing me that my acquaintances had received these heinous abuses.”\nIn 2002, Egypt established a department affiliated with the Ministry of the Interior to “combat computer crimes,” but it continued to operate in a semi-centralized manner in the capital. Then, it expanded over time through regional offices that serve geographical areas covering more than one governorate. In April 2021, the Interior Ministry announced that citizens were now able to submit reports regarding cybercrimes to all security directorates in any Egyptian governorate.\nFor nearly 7 years, and during most of his annual vacations in Egypt, Eng. Ahmed was trying to write a report against the account that was accusing him of insults, but did not succeed “because of his presence outside the country,” as he put it, and his inability for years to quickly and urgently prove the crime had occurred. (Asharq Al-Awsat refrains from explaining the technical details used to prove the crime that the writer of the investigation reviewed in detail, in order to avoid illegal re-exploitation.)\nThe issue of threatening the engineer’s son was central to his move in pursuing the woman accused of blackmailing him. Especially after the school administration informed him that it had notified the police of the Arab country in which it is located of the letters it had received. The officials informed the father (after his return from his vacation) that they had verified that the letters received by the school were from “outside their borders,” and therefore “they would not be able to take additional steps,” as he said.\nLater, the “blackmailer” escalated her attack, “asking for money”, according to the official indictment against her, and broadcast the offensive content to the parents of the son’s classmates at school, further exacerbating his “harsh” experience, as he describes it.\nAs the pressures grew, the man was forced, as he told Asharq Al-Awsat, to take emergency leave from work for days and incur “large financial costs” to come to Egypt more than once to fulfill “a number of technical and legal requirements necessary to prove the crime” and file a lawsuit against the perpetrator.\nInside the Mansoura Criminal Court in Dakahlia Governorate (135 kilometers north of Cairo), Asharq Al-Awsat attended the trial session of the accused in the case of engineer Mohamed Ahmed, where investigations indicated that the woman “used defamation and blackmail with more than 10 other victims inside and outside Egypt,” in addition to Engineer Ahmed.\nAt the end of one of the sessions that the accused attended after her arrest, Lawyer Ahmed Al-Bakri, who is the legal attorney of engineer Ahmed, spoke to Asharq Al-Awsat, saying that the “pattern of that crime was innovative, because the perpetrator did not have special images or shameful facts, but only relied on information provided by social media sites, tracked the victim’s accounts and acquaintances, and focused on expanding the scope of defamation by messaging them.”\nBased on this blackmailing case, which took place between two countries, Al-Bakri believes that there is a practical need to task the embassies with submitting complaints and reports related to electronic crimes, if the perpetrator had the same nationality of the victim, even if the latter resided in a different country.\nIf this proposal has merit...what about the cases in which the victim holds the nationality of one country and resides in it, while the perpetrator has a different nationality and residence?\nBetween three elements was the case of the Iraqi woman Shams (her nickname). Her blackmailer holds “Syrian nationality” and resides in “Germany,” according to what he told her, while she lives in one of the governorates of Iraq.\nMrs. Shams (32), a divorced mother of five children, spoke to Asharq Al-Awsat on condition of anonymity for fear that she would be exposed to danger.\nShe said: “Like everyone, I have accounts on social media, and through them, in early 2021, I met a person who told me that he was a Syrian refugee residing in Germany. Over time, the conversation between us developed and he proposed to marry and come to Iraq to get engaged and take responsibility for my children.”\nShe added: “I decided to talk to him and we got to know each other.” In a very low voice, which forced her to record her message twice, Mrs. Shams spoke, justifying the matter by saying that she feared being heard by a member of her family, whom she described as “extremist” and who resides with her due to her separation from her husband.\nOver time, “his (the blackmailer’s) intentions began to appear, but he did not blackmail me financially, but rather with my private photos to force me to do what he wanted, otherwise he threatened to publish these photos,” the woman recounted.\nWith pain that resounded in her stuttering words, Shams narrates that, under the weight of fear, she tried to calm the blackmailer, “but to no avail... He started asking me for ‘some nice things’, and unfortunately I started doing everything he wanted, for a period of 6 months.”\nHowever, things developed, and the woman was surprised that her blackmailer, according to her words, “began asking me to perform satisfactory sexual acts related to my five-year-old daughter... Then I fought with him and blocked him.”\nDespite the risk of defying tribal norms and the fear of stigma if her problem was exposed, Shams tried to carefully follow the legal path to stop the threat. She says: “I called the (community police) in the governorate in which I live, and they could not help me because he (i.e. the blackmailer) was outside Iraq, and also communicated with National Security, and reached the same obstacle.”\nIraq has not yet been able to pass a law to combat cybercrimes, although a draft law was already submitted to Parliament 12 years ago and was subject to amendments. However, Iraqi executive authorities are tasked with confronting some cybercrimes and the blackmail associated with them, including the “Iraqi Community Police.”\nAccording to an official statement, an annual increase in electronic blackmail crimes is observed in Iraq, amounting in 2021 to about 1,950 cases handled by the community police, said Brigadier General Ghaleb Al-Attiyah, the former commander of the Iraqi community police, in remarks to Asharq Al-Awsat. (He left his position in October).\nThe particularity of Iraqi society leaves its mark on the way extortion crimes are treated, since “most of the victims are women, especially children,” according to Al-Attiyah, who explained that the “seriousness of the matter is that these incidents in Iraqi society develop into what is known as crimes of honor killing, or killing to wash away shame, or suicide, not to mention girls running away from their families for fear of their lives.”\nAl-Attiyah attributed the increase in electronic blackmail crimes to several reasons, including “the absence of a law on cybercrime, and reliance on the existing penal code dating back to the 1960s.”\nWhen asked by Asharq Al-Awsat about the mechanism followed if the perpetrator was outside the borders of Iraq, he answered: “Certainly, in our work, we face many (transnational) cases... but frankly, we were able to address some of the incidents through (personal relationships) with officers in Arab countries... but this issue is difficult (...) and some routine procedures for tracking and prosecuting allow criminals to get away.”\nA new obstacle hindered the attempts of Iraqi Shams to break free from the shackles of blackmail. If there is no developed local deterrent law that protects her if the perpetrator is residing in her country... then what if she faces a blackmailer from outside the borders?... And what did she proceed?\nLuck was on Mrs. Shams’ side, as when she told a friend about her problem, he advised her to resort to the “Resist Initiative to Combat Electronic Blackmail.” The “Resist” volunteer initiative operates through electronic platforms on social media, and aims to “provide support” to victims.\n“Resist” volunteers obtained enough information about the blackmailer’s identity. When they informed him that they would contact the German authorities if he did not stop the blackmailing immediately, he complied and ended his threats.\nDespite its success in supporting the Iraqi woman, the founder of “Resist,” human rights activist Mohammad Al-Yamani, told Asharq Al-Awsat: “We realize that it is not possible to fully rely on the efforts of activists in transnational blackmail cases, as the movement and coordination of the official police and judicial authorities has more impact and is more legal.”\n“Resist” receives many complaints related to blackmail crimes and undertakes “directing victims to available legal paths, and completing the collection of required incriminating evidence through a legal support team,” according to its founder, who admits that “transnational electronic crimes are very difficult due to the technical and legal obstacles resulting from the absence of regional and international coordination in this field, compared, for example, to exchanging information between countries quickly and intensively in the case of money crimes or terrorism.\nAl-Yamani calls for implementing agreements pertaining to electronic crimes between Arab countries as a “first stage,” and says: “An executive body must be established (similar to Interpol) to exchange information and prosecute criminals in electronic blackmail cases to protect victims.”\nThrough the door of taking pride in the word, paying attention to the gesture, and staying away from what could stain the diplomatic suit, blackmailers of a unique type exploited a weak point in the life of an Arab diplomat, and through arenas and communications that took place in more than one country, including (his workplace), they turned their past electronic weapons on the man, in an incident that was documented and whose details were shared with by activist Mohammad Al-Yamani, without revealing names or identities.\nThings appeared to be almost normal. The Arab diplomat worked in one of the countries, and in one way or another, “he became involved with his female citizen, who was residing in the same country where he worked. After a while, that woman threatened him with publishing the conversations and pictures she obtained in the context of their relationship, and asked him for financial compensation.”\nThe Arab diplomat responded “twice” to the blackmail. In the third time, he thought about resorting to the judiciary but later backed down after he learned that because of his situation, he must notify his country’s foreign ministry and embassy, which consequently means the case will be exposed and his professional future may be at risk.\nBut the surprise was that the two parties to the blackmail crime were not just two residents of the same country, as the Arab diplomat believed, and the victim discovered that “the perpetrator, who had left the crime scene for her home country to escape a potential prosecution, had carried out the operation on behalf of (a third party).”\nThis third party was none other than “the diplomat’s wife, who had a dispute with him and resided in their hometown. She (i.e. his wife) instigated the blackmailer from afar, taking advantage of her distance from the crime scene and the difficulty of prosecuting her internationally, to tighten the screws on the man with the aim to obtain divorce and financial gains, Al-Yamani recounted.\nIn late December 2021, Egyptian student at Ain Shams University, Shorouk Fouad (27), received a message via the Messenger application showing a photo of a person wearing clothes similar to the Egyptian police uniform.\nThe message included a claim from the sender that he “works as an officer,” and that he had received a report against her, accompanied by some pictures of her, according to what Shorouk told Asharq Al-Awsat.\nIn a stressful and confusing manner, the blackmailer pressured the Egyptian girl, who recounted: “He asked me to quickly send my data and pictures so that he would start moving to resolve the issue of the report in an amicable manner, and so that it would not reach my family. Under the pressure of fear and tension, I sent him my data, my location, and my photos.”\nThe relationship took immediately a different turn as soon as the sender obtained the girl’s data and photos. He began to blackmail her for the purpose of “establishing a relationship,” according to what she says, otherwise he would expose her in front of her family. Shorouk confirms that her blackmailer, in further threatening her, “actually created pages on social media” using her photos.\nShorouk, and her family, who supported her after learning of what had happened, thought that filing a police report would prosecute the accused and end a nightmare that had long exhausted them, but instead received a shocking news.\nThe first thing that awaited the girl was that “officials from the Qalyubia Security Directorate and officers from the Internet Investigations” told her, according to her account, that he (i.e. the blackmailer) “is impersonating an officer, and that officers are prohibited from posting pictures in uniform on any social networking site.” The second surprise was that the blackmailer who spoke to her in an “Egyptian dialect” was communicating with her “via a phone number belonging to a Libyan telecommunications company.”\nIn addition to the psychological pressure, the girl suffered the loss of her engagement after problems arose with the young man she was in a relationship with. Regarding the pursuit of her blackmailer, “the only report she was able to file was dated January 4, 2022, at the Qalyubia Security Directorate,” which serves its place of residence. It included her accusation of the blackmailer of impersonating her on Facebook, while saying that she “was informed that no action could be taken against other crimes, because the phone number is not Egyptian.”\n...But can anyone obtain a Libyan phone number without his data being available to service providers?\nIn an effort to investigate Shorouk’s case, Asharq Al-Awsat obtained the phone number through which the Egyptian girl said she received blackmail messages. Based on its key number, the author of this investigation could prove that it belonged to a specific company that provides mobile phone services in Libya. He sent an inquiry to the company, asking whether it was possible for a person to buy a line belonging to the company without proof of his identity... An official in charge of the company’s accounts on social media stated that the rules for purchasing its lines include “providing the national number and proof of identity.” (ID card or passport).\nWhen we asked the company official about the possibility of a non-Libyan citizen purchasing a line, he said that in that case it was necessary to “present a valid passport and a valid residence certificate.”\nDetermining the identity of the owner of the line, or at least the person who sold it to its current user, then seems possible, as Egypt and Libya signed, along with other countries, in 2010 the “Arab Agreement to Combat Information Technology Crimes.”\nThe agreement stipulates the provision of technical and legal assistance and the extradition of criminals in a number of criminal cases, including “sexual exploitation.” While Egypt ratified the convention in 2014, Libya, which is rife with political conflicts, is yet to endorse it.\nDoes the situation seem different from the case of the Egyptian Shorouk in Libya, for example? Libyan human rights activist Khadija Al-Bouaishi tells us that she was “a witness and a supporting party for a number of Libyan women who fell victim to blackmail by a perpetrator in another Arab country. They were asked to send sums of money, otherwise... he (the blackmailer) threatened to publish their pictures and information and say that they practice witchcraft.”\nOnce again, due to the failure to activate international prosecutions, the attempts of these Libyan women to take the legal course against their blackmailer, who resides in another country, were shattered. Al-Bouaishi attributes the matter to “weak legislation, the absence of technical qualifications, and the lack of a local security apparatus specialized in combating cybercrimes.”\n“Thus, many obstacles hinder the prosecution of blackmailers inside the country, and the cases are also more complex and almost impossible if the perpetrator is outside Libya,” she remarked.\nAs technological crimes rely on unconventional means, they do not require a confrontation between the perpetrator and the victim, which guarantees relative safety for the perpetrators, and enable them to some degree to hide and evade prosecution, especially when their activities occur across borders,” Former Assistant Minister of the Interior for Information Technology and Internet Crimes, Major General Mahmoud Al-Rashidi, told Asharq Al-Awsat.\nThe main feature in cases of electronic blackmail, according to Al-Rashidi, is that some “perpetrators rely on exhausting the victims by directing intense abuse based on artificial information with the aim of subjecting the targets to blackmail.”\nThe Interpol places cybercrime among its areas of competence, noting that criminals adopt new techniques to commit attacks against governments, companies and individuals, and that crimes do not stop at borders, whether they were physical or virtual and cause damage and pose threats to victims around the world.\nThe Interpol press office did not respond to questions sent by Asharq Al-Awsat to find out the extent of its participation in operations to pursue, seize, or exchange information in transnational electronic blackmail crimes, especially in Arab countries.\nHowever, a rare experiment carried out by the organization in 2014 resulted in the arrest of 58 people within organized crime networks operating from the Philippines, and which was behind “sexual blackmail” cases, including the case of Scottish teenager Daniel Perry (17), who committed suicide in 2013 after falling victim to an extortion attempt on the Internet.\nAccording to Interpol, this operation was the first of its kind, and witnessed the participation of police agencies in Scotland, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the Philippines, as well as the US National Security Investigations Division, in a process funded by the United Kingdom’s Foreign and Commonwealth Office.\nDespite the Arab precedence in establishing a convention to combat transnational information crimes, these crimes are happening and will continue to occur, until the right mechanisms are put into effect and executive entities are formed to overcome obstacles that hinder its implementation. Only then may hundreds and perhaps thousands of victims be saved from extremely bad fates that begin with defamation and stigma and sometimes end with murder.","length":22555,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[5,8,7,6,7,6,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed investigation into cases of cyber-extortion and blackmail across multiple Arab countries.

And it wasn’t just that the filly was born with a 45-degree twist to her muzzle.\nFoaled in May, the Standardbred newborn had a vibrant energy—a sweetness and a strength. While her facial deviation—clinically known as Wry nose—made it difficult for her to nurse no matter how many times she tried, she kept trying. With one nostril completely closed, she struggled to breathe but still found it within herself to nuzzle her dam, Coco, and to cheerfully greet the humans who’d assisted in her birth.\nIt was clear the filly could not live a comfortable life without major medical intervention. And even if that went well, it was extremely unlikely that she would be able live up to her potential as an equine athlete. But that didn’t matter to her owner, Matt Morrison of Morrison Racing.\nShortly after her arrival into the world, the veterinarian who assisted in Coco Chanel 23’s foaling contacted Morrison to alert him to the filly’s extreme deformity. Even with possible surgical intervention, it was unclear if she’d ever live a comfortable life. The foal’s future was in Morrison’s hands, and he knew what the general response was for this type of condition in such a young horse: “‘They’d say, ‘The best thing is to put ‘em down,’” Morrison says.\nBut Morrison didn’t want to euthanize the filly. His teenage daughter agreed, saying they had to at least give the foal a chance.\n“There was a fight in her. She didn’t know she was abnormal. She just knew she needed to feed and was persistent,” he says. “Without that fighting spirit, she probably wouldn’t have survived that first weekend.”\nFittingly, the Morrisons gave the filly a different nickname: Wry Not.\nArmed with her steely tenacity, Wry Not was sent to Penn’s School of Veterinary Medicine’s (Penn Vet) New Bolton Center, the large animal hospital, where a multidisciplinary team of clinical specialists were prepping to give her a shot at a long, healthy life.\nWry nose, especially cases as severe as Wry Not’s, are not common. The filly’s surgical team, Kyla Ortved and Jose Garcia-Lopez, say they’ve each seen at most three cases.\n“It was a severe deviation, the most extreme that I’d ever seen,” Garcia-Lopez says. “Where it was bent also made (surgery) more complicated.”\nBefore the surgeons could plot the best ways forward, doctors took a scan of the filly’s muzzle using New Bolton Center’s OmniTom, a mobile CT scanner that delivers high quality, point-of-care imaging. They also collected some blood from Coco for a transfusion that Wry Not would eventually need to make it through the procedure successfully.\n“There wasn’t a lot of room for error,” Garcia-Lopez recalls. “There was a lot of measuring and careful cutting.”\nThis story is by Natalie Pompilio.

Even if you haven’t watched the movie, the violence and Vinnie Jones are still fun","textContent":"You know how the recent TV series Mr & Mrs Smith had the same title as the film Mr & Mrs Smith, and a similar premise, but you could watch it happily without having seen what was only technically the original? Well, welcome to The Gentlemen, Guy Ritchie’s new series with the same name as his 2019 film. It has a similar premise to the movie, but you could watch it happily without having seen what is only technically the original.The main players in The Gentlemen are swiftly established. A fine, upstanding young officer, Eddie Halstead (Theo James), is yanked out of the army life he loves to take over his family’s 500-year-old estate and dukedom after his father’s sudden death. As the second son, Eddie was not expecting this. The first son, Freddy (Daniel Ings), was expecting it even less. But wills is wills and Daddy’s is very clear.You would think the fact that Freddy is an inveterate gambler and all-round liability might have tipped them off to the possibility of their father setting aside the primogeniture business, but apparently not. (It seems we are not supposed to question their parents’ decision to give their sons rhyming names, either, but that is a side issue.)The main issue is that poor chaotic Freddy is in hock, via bad investments and a coke dealer he met in rehab, to some bad men. Liverpudlians, no less! In tracksuits! This seems to be Ritchie’s answer to the charges of racism levelled at the film, which was seen by some as dividing the world into white cheeky chappies who add to the sum of human happiness by dealing cannabis and Asian heroin dealers (“Chinamen”) who destroy humanity. Everything has been dialled down a notch and the only villains now are northerners. “They’re going to chop my dick off!” Freddy tells Eddie. “Which is fatal, by the way! I looked it up!”So Eddie needs to get his hands on £8m by the end of the week. But, as we all know, it’s hard to liquidate the family Gainsboroughs at such short notice, so it looks as though Freddy might soon be, er, deady. But wait, what’s this? Two mill in the drawing room safe? From an underground cannabis farm in a quiet corner of the estate run by the local cockney crime family? Who were paying the old duke a handsome annual rent and share of the profits for the privilege and everything had been working very nicely for years? But what, in such a situation, should a fine, upstanding baby duke do?And with that – and the advent of Susie Glass (Kaya Scodelario), who is in charge of the cannabis operation while the paterfamilias Bobby (Ray Winstone) is in prison – we are off. Susie provides contacts to the criminal underworld and knowhow, Eddie provides courage and Freddy – well, Freddy just provides more chaos, but that is what a Ritchie crime caper is all about, so good for him. Oh, Vinnie Jones is present and correct, too, as the gamekeeper and Halstead loyalist Geoff.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionDeals, double-deals and violent set pieces in slow and fast motion duly abound. A lot of supposedly comic business goes on far too long (the one involving the chicken suit may be going on still). There are bloody fights and deaths expected and unexpected. Characters-with-a-capital-C come and go (The Gospel, Sticky Pete, the hapless Jethro), as do clean-up men and impossibly neat bundles of cash. Little plots give birth to big plots, big plots give birth to more plots, but it all goes with enough of a swing that missing any finer details won’t affect your enjoyment.There is also a slower-burning narrative fuse in the shape of a painfully elegant rich American called Stanley Johnston (“with a T”, it is added, every time. I think we are meant to imagine a satirical edge to proceedings here). He is played by Giancarlo Esposito (Gus Fring from the Breaking Bad universe), who wants to buy the Halstead home – probably for the cannabis farm rather than his professed architectural interest, because Stanley is the head of a meth empire. Oh crumbs, what a palaver that is going to be.All is as it should be, narratively and stylistically. You can see it as a meditation on class war and the infinite corruptibility of humanity when presented with enough impossibly neat bundles of cash. Or you can see it as a lot of daft stories crammed together and spattered with blood for your entertainment. It’s a slightly underpowered Ritchie film on TV. If you like his films, you should watch it. If you don’t, there is loads of other stuff instead.","length":4486,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T05:00:06.000Z","rating":[5,6,7,6,7,6,7],"reason":"The information in the article about the plot of \"The Gentlemen\" is presented accurately, however, the writing style contains personal opinions and biases which affect the objectivity score.

Framed by a black blazer, a cheeky Kermit the Frog graphic tee peeks out to proclaim “vibe.”\nOn the surface, Brinkman exudes an unassuming friendliness that fits his artwork’s playful aesthetic; one could almost mistake him for one of the cutesy anthropomorphic clouds in his popular Art Blocks project, “Nimbuds.” However, Brinkman’s cheery exterior belies a dry wit and a penchant for real talk.\n“Generative art collectors are the snobbiest people,” Brinkman says with a shrug. “Understanding generative art requires a certain amount of intelligence because you have to understand math and code… Sometimes, people care more about the code than the output. It’s like judging a painting based on the brand of paint that was used. Who cares?”\nOne of the benefits of having a resume as decorated as Brinkman’s is the perspective it lends. Few artists in web3 can lay claim to his credentials — sales at Christie’s and Sotheby’s, six solo collections on Nifty Gateway, two drops on Art Blocks, 39 1/1 mints on SuperRare, an exhibition with Unit London. It’s anything but accidental.\n“Each of those is hitting a different group of collectors than my normal drops hit,” he explains. “And that just expands your kind of circles. I believe you shouldn’t overburden one collector with too much of your work because that puts them in a very risky position. So the more you can keep stretching out and finding new people, the better.”\nSounding every bit the bearer of sage wisdom, it’s hard to believe Brinkman has only focused on his art full-time for less than three years. But such is web3, where that might as well be three decades.\n“Going to Christie’s and seeing my art felt like a personal achievement because I was across the street from my old job,” he reflects. “I would walk in there on my way to work all the time and look at art, so to go in there and see my art there felt like a real moment.”\n“Going to Christie’s and seeing my art felt like a personal achievement because I was across the street from my old job.”BRYAN BRINKMAN\nBrinkman’s entry into digital art came through the lens of his childhood passion for gaming. His earliest digital creations were custom levels built for Duke Nukem 3D, which led to learning more about graphic software. His high school years were spent learning tools ranging from the Adobe Suite to Cinema 4D, posting his creations on sites like Newgrounds where he connected with a community of like-minded creators.\n“They had this voting system where if you got more than two out of five stars, your work could stay on the website. And if it got less than that, it got deleted,” Brinkman recalls. “That became this fun challenge of not only getting on the site but then seeing the comments from people who liked it or didn’t like it. That kept driving me to create more and more.”\nHis curiosity and creativity led him to study at Philadelphia’s University of the Arts, where he expanded his knowledge of animation tools and techniques. Upon graduating, he secured a job doing motion graphics for a fashion ad agency while pursuing commercial work on the side. His work caught the attention of a cartoon series called “The Life and Times of Tim,” which brought Brinkman to Los Angeles to work on the show.\n“That was my entry into the LA scene where I was living with people who worked on ‘Adventure Time,’ and all these other Cartoon Network shows,” Brinkman says. “So I met all these awesome artists and got very inspired. Through that, I got put into galleries like Gallery 98 and did these group shows with them.”\nTracing his journey from LiveJournal to MySpace to Facebook to Tumblr to Instagram, Brinkman credits his prolific posting on social media platforms with opening doors and creating opportunities for his artistry to shine. “I think there’s a deep need for artists just to feel seen,” Brinkman says. “So you’re just putting stuff out hoping someone likes it and says this is great.”\nBrinkman landed a brief stint with MTV working on shows like “Guy Code” and “Girl Code,” which led to an opportunity to work for “Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.” As that show transitioned to “The Tonight Show,” Brinkman found his footing in comedy by working for Fallon and “Saturday Night Live” simultaneously.\n“It was very fast-paced,” Brinkman recalls. “They write out all their jokes in the morning, and you get a list of things to create. There’s a bunch of different checkpoints to get approved by writers, producers, and Jimmy, and then it goes to a rehearsal at 3 p.m., and then the show tapes at 5 p.m. and airs at night, and then you start fresh the next day. So it’s this constant churn, which I appreciated because I like ADHD, and there was a new challenge not only every day, but every hour.”\nHe adds: “It kept me very fresh and gave me more tools to work with. I think that all leads to my NFT work, which is very mixed media and all over the place stylistically.”\nIn February 2020, Brinkman entered the NFT space by minting his first 1/1 pieces on SuperRare and quickly began building a collector base with notable names like j1mmy and WhaleShark. In October, Brinkman debuted his first Nifty Gateway drop, “Cloudy,” which he now considers a career breakthrough.\n“My drop ended up being the day after Beeple’s first drop, so there was a ton of heat immediately,” he recalls.\n“Bryan always stood out for his unique use of color, the energy and vitality of his artwork, and his willingness to be unique and try things other people were not doing,” says Duncan Cock Foster, Nifty Gateway’s co-founder. “He was always visually appealing and prolific, and it amazed us how he could effortlessly execute on many new styles.”\nBrinkman continued flexing his creative muscles, making his first foray into generative art in January 2021 with his Art Blocks Curated debut, “Nimbuds.” Working with friend and coder Manny Morales, Brinkman reimagined the neon colors and cloud motifs from his early work as a 400-piece on-chain collection that remains one of his most recognizable releases.\n“When I joined the NFT space, I wanted to start fresh. I started with my piece, ‘Explode,’ with those colors. I realized that if I use those colors, I can try out any style or medium, but it all ties together,” Brinkman explains. “That same idea also went with the iconography. So the clouds from the explosion started to symbolize the clouds that we’re storing all this art on, and then there were the wires that symbolize the connections between each other. You look at ‘Nimbuds’ and see the lineage connected to the Nifty Gateway and the SuperRare piece I did.”\n“If these people are spending their hard-earned money for me to make art and grow as an artist, it would be disingenuous for me to continue working full time and just do this on the side.”BRYAN BRINKMAN\nAs Brinkman’s profile and market grew, so did the pressure to focus more on his craft. However, he did not make the decision to leave “The Tonight Show” lightly. \n“There was a feeling of responsibility,” he recalls. “If these people are spending their hard-earned money for me to make art and grow as an artist, it would be disingenuous for me to continue working full time and just do this on the side because this was the dream I’ve always had, right?”\nOne week later, while working at SNL, Brinkman received the script for the show’s now-famous NFT sketch and was able to include his artwork in the segment. “That was another sign to me,” he reflects. “When that came out, I was like, ‘Oh, this is actually reaching into popular culture.'”\nPERSONAL NEWS:Yesterday was my last day at @FallonTonight. After ~8 years & 1500+ episodes, I stepped away to focus on my art & the NFT space. Having a sustainable income from creating art is always a dream & this platform has made it a reality. Thank you all for the support❤️ pic.twitter.com/MECMZ3PUsq— Bryan Brinkman (@bryanbrinkman) April 10, 2021\nIn April 2021, he officially left “The Tonight Show” to focus on his art full-time and poured all his time and attention into preparing for his second Nifty Gateway drop, “Flicker Fusion.” Coming on the heels of a market crash, the collection sold 80% of its supply before stalling. \n“It took me all summer to sell it out,” Brinkman recalls. “Then it did well once it sold out. It’s because I went on a Top Shot podcast. I hit a different demographic that I exposed my art to. My advice is to experiment, get weird, try to branch out.”\nBrinkman’s market took off as NFT market volume reached new all-time highs that summer. In May 2021, his “Betty’s Notebook” collaboration with Verdigris Ensemble sold for $215,989 on Async Art — marking a career-high for Brinkman. The project delved into Amelia Earhart’s disappearance from the perspective of a 15-year-old girl via a dynamic music NFT accompanied by Brinkman’s visuals and a physical short-wave radio.\n“It was split like 40 ways because we were able to pay it out to the choir singers, conductors and composers,” he recalls. “The conductor said it might have been the first time a choir made a profit on music. It was a big moment.”\nCock Foster attributes Brinkman’s success to “his skill, persistence, personality, and his earnest presence on social media.” \n“His commentary is often a breath of fresh air, and he provides a perspective you can’t find anywhere else,” says Cock Foster. “His artwork is unique and beautiful, and I can recognize it instantly when it shows up on my timeline.”\nWhile the bull market proved fruitful for Brinkman’s career, he soon found himself overwhelmed by opportunity.\n“During the bull, the challenge was not getting overwhelmed,” Brinkman says. “There were moments when I got very burnt out because I’d said yes to too many things. There was this constant comparison problem. You compare yourself to all these VIPs who, in one day, are making twice as much as you’ve made in two years. There’s a mental health problem there, where you’re like, ‘Should I be doing this?'”\n“His commentary is often a breath of fresh air and he provides a perspective you can’t find anywhere else.”DUNCAN COCK FOSTER\nHe’s carried these lessons into a lengthy and challenging bear market that has tested the mettle of web3’s digital art community. \n“It’s a hard time for everybody, including myself,” he admits. “What we’re seeing is the speculation of the space, which is the driving force of volume favors momentum. So we’ll see someone have a month of momentum, which can demoralize many artists who don’t have that moment.”\nBrinkman stresses the importance of intentional marketing while building a strong collector base. “When you create games and gambling incentives, you attract people that care less about the art and more about winning.”\n“I feel for collectors,” he adds. “Anytime I make a purchase, a bunch of artists hit me up, ‘Man buy this, buy this.’ So I can only imagine how much a collector has to deal with in those terms. It’s hard to tell an artist I think their work is cool, but it’s just not my style.”\nBrinkman has no shortage of opinions on the state of web3. \nHe laments the downfall of creator royalties amid the battle for market share between Blur and OpenSea, which he describes as having a “horrible impact” on the space. Brinkman feels that it has turned away many artists drawn to the space by its promise and has limited how artists can engage the community.\n“I understand everyone wants to make as much money as possible, but it came at the expense of artists doing airdrops, free mints, or things collectors liked,” he says. “Now we’re stuck with just doing sales all the time. I feel like we lost a lot of the fun when we lost creator royalties.”\n“I feel like we lost a lot of the fun when we lost creator royalties.”BRYAN BRINKMAN\nBrinkman is optimistic about marketplaces like Magic Eden, Deca, Sansa, and others safeguarding royalties, believing they can help reclaim some of the lost revenue streams to creators.\n“I’ve always looked at the marketplaces as a garage sale versus a vintage shop,” he explains. “You can go buy something really cheap at a garage sale if you dig around and get lucky and find it. Or you can pay a premium to a curated vintage shop because it’s collected and easy to find quality. I think we’ll see artists’ marketplaces come up and be that kind of place.”\nBrinkman always looked up to OG crypto artists like Sarah Zucker and Coldie, who allocated a certain percentage of their art sales to supporting fellow artists. Unfortunately, he feels they are a dying breed, expressing disappointment with a new generation of artists who extract value from the web3 space without giving back. \n“I see a lot of artists that do really well in this space who don’t put that energy back towards others, and that bums me out,” Brinkman says. “Why aren’t you buying more? I could see it sometimes being the appearance of endorsement. Some of it might be frugalness. Maybe it’s just a matter of not fully believing in the technology long-term.”\nWhile Brinkman recognizes AI technology as a “powerful tool” and “a topic of our time,” he’s also a wry realist who believes “99% of AI art will go to zero.”\n“I think the trends of it are so short-lived that a lot of the art being made with it right now will look very bad,” Brinkman says. “I worry that a lot of artists are chasing these trends, and a year from now, they will just have a bunch of unsellable stuff because those trends will be replicated to such a crazy degree.”\n“99% of AI art will go to zero… I think the trends of it are so short-lived that a lot of the art being make with it right now will look very bad.”BRYAN BRINKMAN\nHe adds, “It’s like Roope Rainisto said: we need to embrace how bad things are right now. I think there’s truth to that, but will the 50 projects that look just like ‘Life in West America’ hold value? You have to be the first or have a very strong storyline and voice; otherwise, it’s just going to be the same as a PFP where it’s just going to go to zero.”\nOne area where Brinkman remains bullish is consumer adoption of AR technology and its intersection with the art world.\n“I think there will be a digital overlay to all physical art in the future,” he says. “So if you’re looking at a painting in AR glasses, you’re going to be getting virtual highlights, additional context, and more information on the art in a way that combines physical and digital.”\nOn Oct. 6, Brinkman held his first solo gallery show in New York with Blackdove, debuting three new pieces in his “Sky Lines” collection and showcasing a retrospective of works tracing his career journey. Guests sipped champagne and meandered through the exhibition, collecting signed prints, floral stickers, and enamel pins beside candy-colored displays.\nViewed in close proximity, the juxtaposition made evident the evolution of Brinkman’s artistic output and the common themes that tie them together as a body of work.\n“I think having all those different works together helps people understand that bigger picture I built with iconography and these threads that connect everything,” he says.\nAs the gallery show was one night only, it left Brinkman with an appetite for more in-person activations. He muses about throwing a concert at NFT NYC but recognizes it would be a different beast. \n“The nice thing about the gallery is there wasn’t a lot of competition,” he says. “But NFT NYC, where you’re competing with ten other events?”\nIn the meantime, Brinkman remains focused on several forthcoming projects while still finding time to experiment with new art formats, including a series of generative theme park maps with Pindar Van Arman that may or may not see release. Ever curious, he recently purchased a plotter and 3D printer and is “having fun playing” with them while eyeing future crossovers between his digital and physical works.\n“There’s no shortage of cool things to work on in this space,” he gushes. “I’m excited to play more with physical merch. I’m excited to target more interesting communities where you make a piece for a curated set of artists’ drops. I’m also excited to do more experimental work, whether playing with AR or generative works. It’s just fun to have more tools in the belt.”","length":17204,"publishedTime":"2024-02-13T16:18:18+00:00","rating":[5,6,7,6,8,6,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed insight into Bryan Brinkman's background, journey, achievements, and thoughts on the NFT space.

In a recent paper published in Physical Review Letters, they have introduced a promising new strategy, based on a concept introduced by American physicists Stanley Autler and Charles Townes in the 1950s.\n\"We've been working for almost 20 years on water wave-related issues, and for the last five years or so we focused on problems specifically linked to the absorption of these waves for the protection of coasts or offshore structures,\" Agnès Maurel, co-author of the paper, told Phys.org. \"To this end, we have developed strategies based on resonant mechanisms, as is the case in this study.\"\nIn their paper, Maurel and her colleagues introduced new strategy for realizing the perfect resonant absorption of guided water waves, which is based on a resonant effect known as Autler-Townes splitting. This is a physical effect occurring in two-level resonant systems, which is characterized by a splitting of two transition states into smaller \"doublet\" states separated by the a so-called Rabi oscillation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAutler-Townes splitting was realized and observed in various physical systems, ranging from radio frequency sources to lasers and atoms. As part of their study, Maurel and her colleagues tried to leverage this well-established effect to control the propagation of guided water waves.\n\"This experimental achievement stems from a theoretical analysis of the resonant mechanism we published last year, which we adapted for the specific purpose of absorbing water waves,\" Maurel explained. \"Léo-Paul Euvé, through his innovative approach to implementing experiments and optical measurements in the laboratory, ultimately managed to demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism.\"\nThe researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of their proposed strategy for controlling the propagation of water waves theoretically, in numerical simulations and experimentally. In their experiments, they were able to realize the complete absorption of guided water waves, using a carefully designed asymmetric point-like scatterer, comprised of two closely spaced resonant side channels connected to a guide.\n\"The efficiency of absorption, i.e. the complete suppression of waves reflected and transmitted by a sub-wavelength device, is the result that seems most significant to us,\" Maurel said. \"Practical applications of course concern the design of such systems for coastal protection and, in general, for all structures at or near the sea.\"\nThis research team's proposed strategy to enable the resonant absorption of water waves could soon be tested further in both laboratory and real-world settings. If its effectiveness is confirmed, it could ultimately be employed in coastal regions, to control the energy with which waves hit surrounding shores and man-built structures, thus limiting associated damage.\n\"In the context of applications spanning seas and oceans, it is crucial to consider the inherently non-linear nature and wide spectral content of water waves,\" Maurel added. \"While not necessarily delving into specific applications at this moment, we must incorporate these factors into our forthcoming studies, a process that is already underway.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLéo-Paul Euvé et al, Perfect resonant absorption of guided water waves by Autler-Townes splitting.

But if you’ve just been invited to your first, what can you expect?\nYou may think of Sunday lunch as a relaxed situation where participants are more or less free to wear whatever they want as long as they look half presentable. \nFashion-conscious Italians however aim to look smart even on occasions when none but close family members or friends are present, just to make una bella figura, or ‘a good impression’.\nIt’s not at all rare for Italians to turn up to Sunday lunch with fancy outfits and flashy accessories. Keeping this in mind when picking out your own attire may well spare you some funny looks from across the table later on.\nThink of a very, very long meal, then add a couple of hours, and you may get close to the average length of an Italian Sunday lunch. \nPranzi domenicali are no brief business and it’s not just because of the unconscionably large quantities of food being served, but also because Italians like to take things slowly, and try to extend social occasions for as long as they can. \nOverall, it’s not rare for a Sunday lunch to last three, four or even five hours in some areas of the country.\nCustomers sat at a restaurant in Ravello, Campania. Photo by Sterlinglanier on Unsplash\nStarter (antipasto), first course (primo piatto), second course (secondo) and sides (contorni), cheese or fruit, and dessert – all served in generous portions. \nThat’s the very minimum you can expect from a Sunday lunch.\nREAD ALSO: How many different types of pasta are there in Italy?\nThe jury is still out on exactly how Italians can get through food marathons of this scale on a regular basis, but what’s certain is that you’ll find it hard to keep up with them, at least for the first couple of outings.\nIf you can’t finish your food, don’t worry: an overly dramatic non ce la faccio piu’ (literally, ‘I can’t take it anymore’) will usually get you off the hook.\nBy the time lunch comes to an end, you’ll likely find yourself wondering how many working days your body’s going to take to process all of the food you’ve just eaten.\nLuckily, you’ll get a chance to give your stomach a helping hand by drinking a digestivo, a highly alcoholic, intensely flavoured liqueur which Italians swear by when it comes to digestion issues.\nWhether it is an amaro, a limoncello, or some fiery grappa, the digestivo will be served neat in a small shot glass (but shouldn’t be guzzled in one go like a shot).\nYou may hear some Italians refer to the digestif as ammazzacaffe' (or 'coffee killer') as it generally deadens the caffeine buzz of the espresso consumed at the end of lunch.\nSunday lunches in Italy can be a bit hard on people with low noise tolerance (Italians aren’t exactly known for being soft-spoken, and that tends to get worse after a few glasses of red).\nBut you can generally expect the chatter to fizzle out pretty quickly after the last round of digestivi as most people drift into the quintessential pennichella – a post-lunch snooze revitalising body and soul.\nYou can either join the others in the land of Nod, or sit back and enjoy the longed-for silence.\nDo you think we've missed anything?

Some 55% of Americans said in a CNN poll in August that Congress should not authorize additional funding to support Ukraine. The survey found 71% of Republicans opposed new spending.\nThe more so, sending more taxpayer funds to a war on the edge of Europe is incompatible with the “America First” creed of a party dominated by ex-President Donald Trump.\nAccording to the U.S. experts, years of costly foreign wars have lead to economic crises. Pro-Trump Republicans have locked into a concise yet powerful argument among their supporters that could spell doom for Ukraine’s hopes of more help from Washington. They say that the US should not be spending billions of dollars abroad to fight Ukraine’s war when America is facing a crisis at its border with Mexico.\nThere’s a growing conversation in the foreign policy community about whether an alternative approach – that is more politically sustainable – is possible. Is it, for instance, more feasible for the US and Europe to focus on preventing Ukraine from losing any more territory – in preparation for future ceasefire talks – than it is to think about winning the war?\nThe Ukraine war funding showdown highlights how America’s domestic politics are already reverberating around the globe.\nThe American public is broadly dissatisfied with how things are going at the border, according to a new Pew Research Center survey.\nEight-in-ten U.S. adults say the government is doing a very or somewhat bad job dealing with the large number of migrants seeking to enter the U.S. at the border with Mexico. And nearly as many say the situation is either a “crisis” (45%) or a “major problem” (32%) for the U.S.\nRepublicans and Republican leaners overwhelmingly say the large number of migrants trying to enter the country is leading to more crime in the country: 85% say this, including 90% of conservative Republicans and 77% of moderate and liberal Republicans.\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump, the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, has promised to crack down on illegal immigration and restrict legal immigration if elected to a second four-year term in office.\nTrump has said he would restore his 2019 “remain in Mexico” program, which forced non-Mexican asylum-seekers attempting to enter the United States at the Mexican border to wait in Mexico for the resolution of their cases.\nThe program was terminated by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who is seeking reelection in 2024. Biden defeated Trump in 2020, pledging more humane and orderly immigration policies, but has struggled with record levels of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.\nTrump has said he will seek to detain all migrants caught crossing the border illegally or violating other immigration laws, ending what he calls “catch and release.”\nTrump focused on building a wall on the Mexico border during his first term and has pledged to close gaps in the border wall if reelected. His administration built 450 miles (725 km) of barriers across the 1,954-mile (3,145-km) border, but much of that replaced existing structures.\nTo Trump’s mind, and he has public support on this issue, America needs money to counter illegal migrants and to build a wall on the Mexico border instead of sending millions of dollars to Ukraine.","length":3508,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T10:00:30+00:00","rating":[5,7,6,4,7,6,7],"reason":"The article provides information on the decreasing support in the U.S. for financial involvement in the Ukrainian war, particularly among Republicans.

The two nuclear-armed states both claim the region in its entirety and have fought two wars over it in the decades since.\"People used to ask who will tour Jammu-Kashmir - now thousands are,\" Mr Modi told thousands of people packed into Srinagar's Bakshi stadium. \"Friends, Jammu and Kashmir is touching new heights of development because it is breathing freely now. This freedom has come after the removal of Article 370, which had been a barrier.\" He announced projects worth 64bn rupees ($774m; £607m) to support local agriculture and tourism. His comments about Article 370 - a constitutional provision which had granted significant autonomy to the former state of Jammu and Kashmir - echo what he said last month on a visit to mostly-Hindu Jammu. Mr Modi's decision to impose direct federal rule angered many Kashmiris. One local leader said that almost none of those attending Mr Modi's rally would be going of their own free will. \"Employees who don't show up are being threatened with disciplinary action,\" former Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah alleged in a message on X, formerly Twitter.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Security personnel frisking people waiting to attend the rallyAnalysts say the message Mr Modi wants to send is that things are back to normal in the territory, despite incidents of violence and high levels of unemployment. His government talks about a new era of peace and development since 2019, but many locals and critics say they have faced a crackdown on civil liberties and press freedom.His government is keen to talk up projects worth hundreds of millions of dollars that it says are part of a plan to integrate Kashmir's economy with the rest of India. Until Jammu and Kashmir's special status was removed, outsiders could not buy land to do business there. Many locals say they have yet to see the benefits of such projects.Revoking part of the constitution that allowed Indian-administered Kashmir special status had been a poll promise and Mr Modi's government announced the move soon after he won re-election in 2019. Article 370 had granted privileges to Jammu and Kashmir including the right to have its own flag, legislature, constitution and laws. It was the only Muslim-majority state in India. After the abrogation of Article 370, its 12 million people were divided into two federally-administered territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and remote, mountainous Ladakh. Tens of thousands of extra Indian troops were deployed ahead of the move, which shocked locals and upended normal life in the region - but was backed by many of Mr Modi's supporters. Schools and colleges were shut in the former state, telephone and internet services suspended and local political leaders placed under house arrest or moved to jails in other parts of India. In December, India's Supreme Court upheld the abrogation of Article 370 - but said the government had promised to restore Jammu-Kashmir's statehood and should do so as soon as possible. Analysts say Mr Modi's visit will set the tone for the BJP's campaign in the region for the coming general election, due by May. Most of those the BBC spoke to ahead of the visit were critical, although one or two were prepared to wait and see what the PM said.One worker at a private firm in Srinagar told the BBC that removing Article 370 had been a \"great injustice\" and he would not go to the PM's rally. \"When did he ever talk about the atrocities being committed against Muslims across the country?\" Another person said: \"Electricity rates are skyrocketing. One has to put in so much effort even to get rice. Inflation is skyrocketing. Why should we go to listen to the speech of such a government?\" Prior to Mr Modi's visit, the streets of Srinagar were cleaned and bill boards put up to welcome him. Thousands of security personnel were deployed to ensure security and check people and vehicles moving in and out of Srinagar. The presence of Indian forces is contentious, with security personnel accused of numerous human rights abuses and other excesses over decades. Thursday's visit was one among many events Mr Modi will attend before general election voting dates are announced. On Wednesday, he inaugurated an underwater metro rail tunnel in Kolkata in India's West Bengal state.Read more India stories from the BBC:More on this story","length":5069,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T02:52:53.000Z","rating":[null],"reason":"rating:","conclusion":"6, 8, 5, 7, 6, 7]\r\nreason: The article provides factual information about Prime Minister Modi's visit to Indian-administered Kashmir and the economic changes in the region since the revocation of its special status.

Her eyes are sunken with grief.","textContent":"'We have nothing': Children face starvation in Gaza as supplies run out\n Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n Anwar Abdul Nabi perches on the edge of a bed at the Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza. Her eyes are sunken with grief.\n The young mother tenderly holds the fingers of her daughter, Mila. Just minutes ago, the 3-year-old girl died of starvation.\n “My daughter was taken into to God’s mercy, because of the lack of calcium, potassium and oxygen,” Nabi told CNN on Monday, as she cried into the arms of an elderly relative. “Suddenly, everything dropped, because she was not eating anything with iron, or eggs. She used to eat eggs every day before the war. Now nothing. She passed away.”\n As Israel’s severe restrictions on aid entering the Gaza Strip drain essential supplies, displaced Palestinians told CNN they are struggling to feed their children. Starving mothers are unable to produce enough milk to breastfeed their babies, doctors say. Parents arrive at overwhelmed health facilities begging for infant formula. Civilians have lost on average tens of kilograms of weight, according to relief workers. In northern Gaza, people rush to grab aid from infrequent humanitarian drops. Health workers say they cannot offer life-saving treatment to malnourished Gazans because Israel’s bombardment and siege has crushed the medical system.\n The Ministry of Health in Gaza said Tuesday that since the beginning of the war, 364 health workers had been killed; 269 medical staff arrested; 155 health facilities “destroyed,” and 155 ambulances “targeted.” CNN cannot independently confirm the numbers due to the lack of international media access to Gaza.\n Israel launched its military offensive in Gaza after the militant group Hamas killed at least 1,200 people and kidnapped more than 250 others in southern Israel on October 7.\n Since then, Israel’s attacks on Gaza have killed at least 30,717 Palestinians and wounded another 72,156 people, according to the Ministry of Health in the enclave, while its siege has drastically diminished vital supplies and left the enclave’s population of some 2.2 million people exposed to high levels of acute food insecurity or worse, according to the Integrated Food Security and Nutrition Phase Classification (IPC), which assesses global food insecurity and malnutrition.\n At least 20 Palestinians have starved to death in Gaza, Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, said on Wednesday. The youngest baby who died of starvation in the enclave was one day old, according to Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan hospital. The true number could be even higher, as limited access to northern Gaza has hindered the ability of aid agencies to fully assess the situation there. UN experts accused Israel of “intentionally starving” Palestinians in Gaza. Israel insists there is “no limit” on the amount of aid that can enter Gaza, but its inspection regime on aid trucks has meant that only a tiny fraction of the amount of food and other supplies that used to enter Gaza daily before the war is getting in now.\n One-year-old Watin, in northern Gaza, has grown tired and weak from dehydration. Instead of drinking baby formula, she is surviving on one to two dates a day.\n “She is only taking one meal,” said her father, Ikhlas Shehadeh, who struggles to scavenge enough food to feed his baby girl. “She spent a long time without any milk. This child is suffering from the inability to move,” he told CNN on Tuesday. “We do not know what to do.”\n The babies of thousands of women “who are due to give birth in the next month in the Gaza Strip are at risk of dying,” the UNICEF State of Palestine Humanitarian Situation report said on Tuesday. At least 5,500 pregnant women “do not have access to prenatal or postnatal check-ups because of bombings and need to flee for safety,” the report said.\n “Anxiety is also leading to premature births,” the report added, citing the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF.) The report also said over 90% of children “aged 6-23 months and pregnant, breastfeeding women face severe food poverty with access to two or fewer food groups per day.”\n Food shortages are reportedly the worst in northern Gaza, where Israel concentrated its military offensive in the early days of the war. Child malnutrition in the region is about three times higher than in southern Gaza, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Screenings at health facilities there have previously found at least one in six children under the age of two are acutely malnourished, said Richard Peeperkorn, WHO representative for the territory. He warned those figures are “likely to be greater today.” Pregnant and breastfeeding women also face “grave threats to their health” caused by malnutrition, the Global Nutrition Cluster, an alliance of NGOs, reported in February.\n Dr. Muhammad Salha, acting director of Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, told CNN medical workers are treating cases of dehydration, gastroenteritis, and hepatitis among women and children.\n “There are babies who died in their mothers’ wombs, and surgeries were performed to remove the dead fetuses,” he said on Monday. “Mothers are not eating because of the conditions we are living in, and this affects the infants … There are causes of many children suffering from dehydration and malnutrition, leading to death.”\n Israel’s bombardment has forcibly displaced at least 1.7 million Palestinians, according to the UN’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Many of those who fled the fighting are crammed into overwhelmed shelters without basic sanitation, leading to the spread of infections. Malnourished children, especially those with severe malnutrition, are at greater risk of dying from illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia, according to the World Health Organization.\n Another doctor in northern Gaza, Ahmad Salem, said patients in intensive care and neonatal units were dying from malnutrition and a lack of oxygen, which are difficult to administer amid fuel shortages. “We suffer from starvation of mothers,” the medical worker in the Kamal Adwan Hospital told CNN. “We cannot find an alternative to mother’s milk, which leads to the death of those children.”\n Mohammed Hamouda, a displaced health worker in Rafah, told CNN that his friend, a doctor at Al-Awda Hospital in northern Gaza, is unable to treat wounded patients because he is exhausted from hunger.\n “If the situation is still like this, in the next week or the next two weeks, I think many thousands of babies will die, and many thousands of elderly and pregnant women will die,” he added.\n Footage obtained by CNN shows scores of desperate civilians clambering over each other to grab ration packs from aid drops in northern Gaza.\n On Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt sent 42 tons of medical supplies and food via airplanes in the region, the Emirati Ministry of Defense said. The US military said it had, alongside the Royal Jordanian Air Force, parachuted more than 36,800 meals into northern Gaza that day.\n But human rights groups criticized the drops as inefficient and a degrading way of getting aid to Gazans, urging Israeli authorities to lift controls on land crossings into the enclave. Melanie Ward, the CEO of the UK-based NGO, Medical Aid for Palestinians, urged Israel to “immediately open all crossings into Gaza for aid workers to assist those in need.”\n “Only safe and unfettered access for aid and aid workers, the lifting of the siege, and an immediate ceasefire can end starvation in Gaza,” she said in a statement on Saturday.\n Even when aid does make it into the strip, collecting it can be dangerous.\n Israeli forces opened fire on people waiting for aid on Monday in northern Gaza, eyewitnesses told CNN, in an incident that took place shortly before midnight at the Kuwait Roundabout on Rasheed Street in Gaza City. CNN has reached out to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for comment.\n Last Thursday, at least 118 people were killed while trying to access food aid in Gaza City in one of the worst single tragedies of the war so far. Palestinian health officials said Israeli troops had used live fire as hungry and desperate Palestinian civilians were gathering around food trucks, with Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations, referring to the incident as an “outrageous massacre.” The Israeli military said it first opened fire with warning shots for crowd control, before firing on “looters” who came toward them. Most of the dead were killed by ramming as aid truck drivers tried to escape the gunfire and chaos, eyewitnesses and the IDF both said. CNN is unable to independently confirm the figures.\n Faraj Abu Naji, whose sister gave birth to twin girls a week ago, managed to obtain just three cartons of milk for his newborn nieces in an aid drop in northern Gaza. He told CNN that he injured his foot while trying to buy flour along Al-Rashid Street.\n “We thank God that there is humanitarian aid being dropped from Jordanian and Emirati planes,” he said on Tuesday. “I try as much as possible to obtain milk from the planes that drop aid so that we can provide milk for my nieces for as long as possible.\n “Planes are dropping aid on northern Gaza, and we have become like dogs, running after a bone.”\n This story has been updated to correct Mila’s age.

See me try them all on here with images as well as my honest review on the formulas.","textContent":"I've always been a lip balm fanatic. It's the one beauty product I cannot ever be without. I'm never more than 5 feet away from one; having one in every bag and coat pocket, on my desk and by my nightstand. In fact, my first entry into beauty was aged 10, where I started building my collection of Lip Smackers with each visit to Claire's Accessories, with the aim of collecting every flavour out there. Perhaps then, this is why I've become totally obsessed with Rhode's Peptide Lip Treatment. With different flavours like watermelon and salted caramel, they are practically the grown-up version of the fun flavours I'd grown up with. And who doesn't love a bit of nostalgia? I can only thank Hailey Bieber and her brand Rhode for bringing back the Y2K-inspired flavours.Having tried almost all of the flavours, tints and limited edition shades now, I'd thought it was high-time I shared my honest review of the Rhode Peptide Lip Treatments and Lip Tints. Scroll on ahead as I try on the shades, rate each formula and most importantly: evaluate how delicious each flavour is.Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment Review(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)The FormulaBieber first brought out the first Peptide Lip Treatments in three varieties: Unscented, Salted Caramel and Watermelon Slice, which are are clear and without a tint. However, the flavoured ones pack in both a fun flavour and scent. Since then, we've seen some limited edition flavours drop, such as Strawberry Glaze and Jelly Bean, complete with a nostalgic sparkle in the formula. Since then we've also seen the launch of the Lip Tints—more on those in a moment.Each Lip Treatment contains a whole host of hydrating, nourishing and plumping ingredients, including peptides, shea butter, babassu and cupuaçu, which help to replenish moisture and soften the lips. I'd compare the formulas to that of a lip gloss. They feel luxuriously thick and leave your lips with a glossy lacquer after applying. If you used to love the iconic Lancôme Juicy Tubes, these have a similar consistency.I've been using these on rotation since they launched, and I can really attest to their hydrating and plumping qualities. After wearing these, by lips feel deeply nourished, and they last forever on the lips too. As someone with constantly dry lips, the cocooning layer of these lip balms have been a life saver, acting as a shield in cold weather and aggressive office air condition alike. You can wear them as a regular lip balm, or even as a flash lip mask by applying a thick layer and wiping off after ten minutes, making them great prep for lip products too. In fact, we often see Hailey Bieber pairing these with her favourite lip liners, which she shared exclusively with Who What Wear UK.\n1. Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment: Watermelon Slice(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)\nScent/Flavour: Smells and tastes like watermelon gummy sweetsIf you're a fruity kind of gal, you'll like the watermelon slice flavour. There is no tint here, but you get the whole tutti fruitti experience with this one. The scent and taste is sweet yet subtle, and like all the Peptide Lip Treatment formulas, it leaves lips with a sheer glassy and hydrating sheen. Because these formulas quite thick, a little goes a long way, and I've been surprised at how long a tube has lasted me, even when I reapply multiple times a day.\n2. Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment: Salted Caramel(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)\nScent/Flavour: Smells and tastes like warm, salted caramel sauceIf you have more of a sweet tooth, allow me to acquaint you with Salted Caramel. True to it's name, this tastes of warm, salted caramel sauce you'd drizzle over a dessert. The flavour and scent are a bit stronger with this one, but as someone who craves sweet treats, I've been enjoying applying this on repeat as I enjoy the scent and flavour so much.\n3. Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment: Vanilla(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)\nScent/Flavour: Smells and tastes like vanilla cupcake frostingThis limited edition version was so popular, Rhode brought it back into the permanent collection. I'm I'm pleased that it did. Apparently, this is Hailey's favourite flavour, and I have to agree, it's totally delicious and addictive. The vanilla flavour is like velvetty buttercream frosting on a fluffy birthday cake. Like the other Peptide Lip Treatments, this one is clear too.\n4. Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment: Unscented(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)\nScent/Flavour: Unscented with no flavourWhile I do love the fun flavours, I really like that Rhode brought out an unscented and flavourless version. Not just because some of don't want the fuss of a flavour, but because this is fragrance-free, it's a great option for those with sensitive skin or lips that don't get on well with heavily fragranced products. I keep this one on my bedside table to apply as an overnight mask when I don't want an overpowering flavour before going to bed.\n(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)Next, we have the Peptide Lip Tints, which each have a a sheer yet buildable hue. There are four shades available, Espresso, a sheer brown, Rasberry Jelly, a jammy pink, Ribbon, a soft baby pink and toast, a rosy taupe.These are all unscented and unflavoured, although I'd say there is a subtle plastic-y scent to the tints, but it's not noticeable or off-putting when one the lips. The tints have the same ingredients as the clear Peptide Lip Treatments, so you get all the benefits of the nourishment coupled with a wash of colour. They apply sheer, but you can layer them up for more impact and a glossier opaque effect. We often see Bieber pairing these with a lip liner to create a bolder look.5. Rhode Peptide Lip Tint: Espresso(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)\nThe Shade: Sheer, buildable mocha brownEspresso is a deep brown that gives all the '90s vibes. It looks dark from the tube but applies sheer to give a hint of brown. Depending on your natural lip colour and what effect you're going for, you could layer this over a brown lip liner for a deeper hue or wear alone for a hint of subtle colour. This is the perfect neutral for those with deep complexions, or a moodier hue for those with lighter skin tones. I'm usually a bit scared of brown on my complexion, but I actually ended up really liking this flattering shade of brown.\n6. Rhode Peptide Lip Tint: Raspberry Jelly(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)\nThe Shade: A jammy raspberry pinkA shade like raspberry jelly isn't usually my jam (no pun intended) but if berry tones are your thing, then this is such a fun shade when you want to inject some colour into your look. Th berry hue is really pigmented, and I find that even after this has worn off, it leaves a subtle stain of colour which is really pretty. I can see myself wearing this more in the summer months.\n7. Rhode Peptide Lip Tint: Ribbon(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)\nThe Shade: A delicate baby pinkFun fact: Hailey used to be a ballet dancer, so this shade is a nod to her ballerina days, and it feels right on cue with ballerina core dominating right now. It's a soft, very wearable pink that Hailey often wears with a matching pink blush for a tonal look. I'm finding myself reach for this one during the day for a pretty flush of colour.\nThe Shade: A rosy taupeThe only shade I've not got my hands on yet is Toast (Hailey, if you're reading this, please HMU). This hue is inspired by French toast with a buttery, rosy taupe hue. If you're someone who likes your neutral hues when it comes to lip products, this could be the one for you if you want something easy to throw on throughout the day.\nThe Limited Edition FlavoursThere are a couple of limited edition shades that have launched in the UK that are no longer available, however, we hope that one day they might come back into stock again.9. Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment: Jelly Bean(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)The Scent/Flavour: Sweet and sugary jelly bean with a sparkle finishJelly Bean was launched in the lead up to party season and has a super fun sparkle in the formula. Rhode really captured the jelly bean flavour and scent with this one—it's like tucking into a bag of pic 'n' mix. It might just be me, but I find the glitter particles a little irritating on my lips. But, it's so pretty worn alone or layered over other lip products for touch of glam.10. Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment in Strawberry Glaze(Image credit: @eleanorvousden for Who What Wear UK)The Scent/Flavour: Smells and tastes like strawberry lacesAnother limited edition flavour we've seen is Strawberry Glaze, which was inspired by Krispy Kreme's strawberry glazed doughnuts. Alongside the nourishing formula is a sweet and fruity strawberry flavour, which reminds me of strawberry ice cream sauce or strawberry laces—delicious.Shop Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment Sets\nGet the Unscented, Salted Caramel and Watermelon Slice flavours in this trio kit.\nFor those who can never be without their phone or their lip balm, this phone case allows you to slot a Peptide Lip Treatment into the case—genius.","length":9775,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T07:00:00Z","rating":[7,7,8,6,8,7,7],"reason":"- Accuracy: The article provides accurate information about Rhode's Peptide Lip Treatments, including details about the formulas, flavors, limited edition shades, and the ingredients used.

The problem with these situations is you lose weight and energy is down, and you need time to recover.\"Pochettino said he empathised with fans who booed against Brentford but that circumstances had put paid to any chance of success this season.\"I hope they will be behind us on Monday.

The club said: “Despite the loss in the year and the continued fallout from the sanctions placed on the club in the prior year, the club continues to comply with Uefa and Premier League financial regulations.”Chelsea made heavy losses under Abramovich. The Boehly-Clearlake ownership has sought to drive down the wage bill and has a strategy of signing young players on long and heavily incentivised contracts.Chelsea pointed to their turnover increasing to £512.5m, a rise attributed to increased match-day and commercial revenue after the government lifted restrictions placed on the club after sanctions were placed on Abramovich in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago.The growth was helped by the women’s side winning the Women’s Super League and the FA Cup, while also reaching the League Cup final.

This will help to address these issues to enhance the quality of online communication through various social media platforms.\n IntroductionSocial media (SM), frequently referred to as Web 2.0, encompasses digital technologies that aid the development and sharing of ideas, content, and other forms of expression via networks and virtual communities [1]. The use of social media in the healthcare sector has surged exponentially as more professionals are joining the digital realm to communicate and network professionally [2]. The COVID-19 pandemic further escalated its use for consultations and the rapid dissemination of new knowledge [3]. In a time of social distancing, lockdown, and travel restrictions, these sites facilitated easy communication between people across the globe so much that by mid-2020, 3.96 billion people, more than half of the world’s population, became active social media users [4].The ease and speed with which professional healthcare can be accessed and sought through these web-based applications is undeniable, but it has posed new challenges of unprofessional conduct and controversial posts regarding healthcare. Information technology experts have been warning the public throughout the digital revolution that nothing in any form shared through digital technology is guaranteed to stay safe and private [5]. Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) disclosing patients’ information for the sake of consultation with peers and senior colleagues violate patients’ privacy and confidentiality, as they are not fully aware of the implications of these online practices owing to a lack of training and assessment of ethical digital communication [6].This led to the emergence of a new dimension of professionalism: e-professionalism/online professionalism/digital professionalism. E-professionalism has been defined as “the attitudes and behaviours reflecting traditional professionalism paradigms but manifested through digital media” [7]. Understanding this form of professionalism is essential to incorporate it as a competency for HCPs. Many theories have been proposed to understand digital professionalism. Petronio et al.’s communication privacy management theory states that effective privacy management is essential to balance the disclosure of information, private ownership, boundaries, and control. They proposed that by sustaining a stringent privacy regulation process, HCPs can maintain a professional physician‒patient boundary while safeguarding their privacy. Privacy settings and maintaining virtual boundaries conform to ownership and control over physicians’ personal information while respecting the privacy of patients as well [8]. When patients share information with HCPs, they become confidants and co-owners of information, and thus, maintaining confidentiality becomes essential to avoid privacy turbulence.Another related theory explaining the ethical and behavioral aspects of digital professionalism is Azjen’s theory of planned behavior. Being accountable for one’s actions, declaring a conflict of interest, and respecting colleagues and ethical practice depend on digital norms and attitudes towards the use of social media, and the ability to exercise control while interacting digitally with patients [9].Considering how the unethical use of social media can strain the social contract between medicine and society, there is a growing need to develop assessment principles, criteria, and valid instruments to assess HCPs’ social media attitudes and behaviour [10]. The healthcare authorities and regulatory bodies have issued professional standards, guidelines, evidence-based reports, and consensus statements [11]. The literature showed three scales/ questionnaires, related to online professionalism. These scales and questionnaires are for students and are not appropriate to be used in the context of HCPs. The medical students use social media mainly for educational purposes, and they are more interested in learning than giving patient advice. These tools for social media use are either too specific, focusing on the class or campus setting and the quality of information shared [12, 13], or too general, covering the whole of cyberspace [14]. Therefore, there was a need for a tool that could specifically evaluate the online behaviour of HCPs regarding patient and professional advice. Self-assessment is part of the continuous learning process of adult learners and promotes personal accountability. A self-assessment tool will help HCPs identify their areas of improvement regarding online presence and communication and will provide them with guidance on enhancing their online credibility by avoiding potential pitfalls. It will also help them reflect on their online behaviour and align their online image with their personal and professional goals.Due to globalisation and the diversity of the world, HCPs interact with a wide variety of patients from diverse cultures and ethnic groups on digital platforms; a tool that helps them review their biases and assumptions and render them more culturally sensitive is an absolute necessity. A tool addressing various aspects of digital professionalism can foster a common understanding of online conduct, promote positive interactions, and minimise the risk of misunderstandings or conflicts arising from cultural differences.Multiple documents related to SM guidelines by universities, medical boards, and accrediting bodies are available, and they have outlined almost similar domains of digital professionalism. Of these guidelines, the General Medical Council (GMC) [15] and General Dental Council (GDC) [16] of the UK have outlined detailed guidelines in their document “Ethical Guidance for doctors.” The doctor’s use of social media was published in 2013 as an extension to address digital conduct on social media networks and encompasses the essential aspects of this form of professionalism. Thus, GMC domains were used as they were the most comprehensive, encompassing all major areas of digital professionalism. These guidelines are evidence-based and are constantly updated based on the evolving trends of the digital world.Figure 1 shows a conceptual framework that was designed incorporating domains of digital professionalism, Petronio’s communication privacy management theory, and Azjen’s theory of planned behaviour. This framework helped to understand the construct and the item development process, served as a blueprint for methodology, and helped in answering the following research questions: 1) What are the key domains and items that adequately assess the domains of digital professionalism of healthcare professionals using social media? 2) How can a self-assessment instrument assessing the digital professionalism of HCPs using social media be validated?Fig. 1Conceptual framework for development of digital professionalism self-assessment instrumentFull size imageMethodsThe study was conducted in two phases using the instrument development multiphase mixed-method design (exploratory sequential) from February 2022 to July 2022 (Fig. 2). Ethical approval was obtained from Riphah International University (Riphah/IIMC/IRC/22/2001) and Islamabad Medical and Dental College, Pakistan (No. 56/IMDCIIRB-2022). The participants were HCPs (medical doctors, dental clinicians, nurses, physiotherapists, speech therapists, clinical and community pharmacists). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants during various phases of the study.Fig. 2Phases of the study that show the development and validation of the self-assessment instrument measuring the digital professionalism of HCPsFull size imagePhase 1- Instrument development and qualitative content validationTable 1 shows the eight domains of digital professionalism that were identified from GMC social media guidelines. The items were constructed using multiple social media guidelines as shown in Table 2. The guidelines were searched using PubMed, ERIC, BioMed Central and Google Scholar. Only full text, freely accessible guidelines regarding online/digital professionalism of HCPs (medical and allied healthcare professionals) were included while those for undergraduate medical, dental, and allied sciences students were excluded.\nTable 1 Constructs of digital professionalism and their definitionsFull size tableTable 2 The governing bodies and the documents analysedFull size tableItems written in statement form were matched to response anchors with a 5-point Likert scale. The first version of the instrument was emailed to 15 experts, including HCPs and medical educationists with five years of experience for modification, deletion, and addition of items. Experts’ feedback was analysed, and changes were made based on the following criteria: (1) relevance of the item to construct, (2) ease of understanding, (3) removal of duplicate or ambiguous items, and (4) elimination of spelling and grammatical errors [22].Phase 2: Instrument validationContent ValidityContent validity was established through a) the consensus-building modified Delphi technique and b) the content validity index (CVI). Thirty-five national & international experts were selected based on the following criteria: HCPs who had worked on digital professionalism and/or professionalism and medical educationists with master’s degrees or above with more than five years of experience.\n The content validation Google forms were emailed to 35 experts. They included a summary of the project and informed consent. Moreover, each domain was defined to facilitate scoring along with a short video explaining the instructions. The experts were requested to rank each item based on its importance in measuring the construct on a 5-point Likert scale (very important = 5, important = 4, moderately important = 3, less important = 2, and unimportant = 1). An open-ended question was included at the end of every section of the instrument, and the participants were requested to justify the extreme options.\n Data were analysed using SPSS version 26. The median and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were calculated for each item. The criteria for the acceptability of an item in Delphi rounds were decided beforehand [23];\n Agreement of ≥ 75% of the experts on the upper two measures (very important or important)\n An interquartile range of ≤ 1 on a 5-point Likert scale\n The forms in Word format with percentage agreement of all participants on very important and important, median, and IQR, and the response of the expert in the previous round were emailed individually to the respondents of round 1. Stability refers to the consistency of responses and is established if the responses obtained in two successive rounds do not significantly differ from each other [24]. Experts were requested to review their responses in round 1 and to rank the items again on the previous scale if they wanted to change them.\n Data were analysed using SPSS 26, and stability was calculated through the McNemar change test using nonparametric chi-square statistics to calculate the p value of each item [25, 26]. The value was set at 0.05.\n Google forms were emailed to respondents of previous rounds, who were requested to rate each item on a 4-point Likert scale on relevance (highly relevant = 4, quite relevant = 3, somewhat relevant = 2, and not relevant = 1) and a 3-point Likert scale on clarity of the items (very clear = 3, item needs revision = 2, and not clear = 1).\n The ratings of 3 or 4 on the relevance scale were recorded as “1”, and items ranked 1 or 2 were recorded as “0”. The content validity index of individual items (I-CVI) was calculated by adding 1 s for each item and dividing by the total number of experts (n = 24) [22]. The average CVI scores across all the items gave the content validity index of scale (S-CVI) [27, 28]. Items having an I-CVI of ≥ 0.90 were included. Those between 0.78 and 0.90 were revised, and items with I-CVI ≤ 0.78 were removed [22]. The content clarity average (CCA) was calculated, and items with CCA values above 2.4 (80%) were marked as very clear [22].\n Response process validityCognitive pretesting of the instrument was performed through in-person semi-structured interviews of ten participants using convenience sampling. Pilot testing was performed to identify and resolve any potential issues. Think-aloud and verbal-probing techniques were used with concurrent probes. Notes were taken by the researcher during interviews, which were also audio recorded after taking the participants’s consent for later analysis.\n Audiotaped interviews were transcribed and segmented. Analytic memos were created and coded using predefined categories: (1) items with no problems, (2) with minor problems, and (3) with major problems [29]. This coding was performed by two co-authors independently to assure inter-rater reliability. Moreover, the principal author analysed the coding to solve any differences.\n Pilot testingPiloting was performed to establish the construct validity and internal consistency of the instrument. Many criteria are used to calculate the sample size of pilot testing, such as a subject-to-variable ratio (SVT) of 10:1 [30] and ranges: N ≥ 1000 is excellent, ≥ 500 is good, 100–500 is fair, and < 100 is poor for factor analysis [31], where N is the number of participants. However, a larger sample size decreases sampling error, and it must increase with an increase in the number of factors [32]. Thus, for this study, a sample size of 550 was used for pilot testing and factor analysis, and participants were emailed Google forms. Reminders were sent on Day 5 and Day 10 through email and WhatsApp to increase the response rate.\n Data were analysed by SPSS for descriptive statistics and internal consistency. Construct validity was established through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) using Analysis of Moment Structure (AMOS) 24.0. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was not performed, as there were specific expectations regarding (a) the number of constructs or factors, (b) which items or variables reflect given factors, and (c) whether the factors or constructs were correlated [33]. EFA is performed when the factors are not known or are yet to be determined. While CFA is preferred when there is a strong model based on past evidence regarding the number of factors and which items are related to which factors. The GMC guidelines are comprehensive, evidence-based, and constantly updated based on new research and rapidly evolving digital norms and trends. Thus, the domains of digital professionalism from “Doctors use of social media” by GMC were used, and CFA was done to examine the latent structure and item-factor relationship [34].\n None of the items was reverse coded. While entering the data in SPSS, all the items were considered as continuous variables, as all were on the same Likert scale, and the choices were taken as “Always, Usually, About half the time, Seldom, and Never” from 5 to 1, respectively.\n ResultsPhase 1: Instrument development and qualitative content validationEight constructs measured by 48 items were identified from social media guidelines. A total of 15 participants (RR = 100%) responded, and 40 items were selected after modification and deletion based on their feedback (see Additional file 1: Appendix A).Phase 2: Instrument validation\n A total of 24 experts (n = 24/35) responded in Delphi round 1 with a response rate of 69%. All the items met the predefined criteria with a median ≥ 4, IQR ≤ 1, and the combined percentage of the upper two options ≥ 75%. A total of 24 experts (100%) responded in round 2, and all items showed stability with a p value > 0.05, i.e., there was no statistically significant difference between the responses of experts in two consecutive rounds. In round 3, 23 experts (96%) participated. Five items with an I-CVI less than 0.78 were removed, four items with an I-CVI between 0.78–0.90 were modified, and the rest of the items with an I-CVI greater than 0.90 were accepted. Thirty-four items had CCA > 2.4 and were accepted, while six items with CCA < 2.4 were rephrased (see Additional file 1: Appendix B). Thus, the items were reduced to thirty-five at this stage. The average clarity of the scale was 2.8, and the S-CVI/AVG was 0.91.\n Based on cognitive interviews with 10 participants (n = 10), seven items were rephrased to improve clarity, and two items were merged, while two items were deleted due to major problems (see Additional file 1: Appendix C).\n A total of 500 participants (RR 91%) responded, of whom 210 (42%) responses were obtained on Google forms, while 290 responses (28%) were received on paper-based forms. The results of the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin Measure of Sampling adequacy (KMO) showed an adequate sample for factor analysis (0.962, p < 0.01). The CFA resulted in a model with a good fit as shown in Fig. 3. Table 3 shows the goodness-of-fit for the models, reported through Chi Sq/df, RMSEA, CFI, NFI, TLI, GFI, and AGFI with GFI of 0.86, RMSEA of 0.06, and observed normed χ2 0f 2.7.\n Fig. 3Sequential Equation Model for Instrument. The figure shows factor loadings, factor correlations, and good fit indices (parsimonious, absolute, and incremental fit) for an eight-factor model containing 27 items. Abbreviations used: SA = Self-Anonymity, PS = Privacy Settings, MB = Maintaining Boundaries, MC = Maintaining Confidentiality, CI = Conflict of Interest, ACT = Accountability, RC = Respect for Colleagues, Ethc = EthicFull size imageTable 3 Results of confirmatory factor analysis of the 32-item instrument (n = 500)Full size tableFour items were dropped for the goodness-of-fit model, as they had low loading values (< 0.40), 2nd item of self-anonymity (SA 2), 1st item of maintaining boundaries (MB 1), 1st item of maintaining confidentiality (MC 1), and 5th item of accountability (ACT5). The residual covariance value of the 4th item of respect for colleagues (RC4) was high (> 2) and was thus deleted. The value of Cronbach's alpha α of the instrument was 0.96, and the subscales ranged from 0.61 – 0.97 as shown in Table 4. Thus, the validation process reduced items from 48 in preliminary draft to 28 items in the final instrument as shown in Table 5.\nTable 4 Results of reliability analysis of 28 items (n = 500)Full size tableTable 5 Modifications performed in the instrument during validationFull size tableDiscussionThis study aimed to develop and validate a self-assessment instrument that HCPs can use to assess their online conduct and behaviour through the lens of digital professionalism. The final 28-item instrument showed good content and response process validity. The absolute and incremental fit values of the 8-factor model showed an overall good fit, and its applicability was further strengthened by correlations among the constructs.Professionalism is culture and context-sensitive and thus there are multiple assessment strategies and tools available to assess this competency at the “does” level of Miller’s pyramid including self-assessment scales, multisource feedback (MSF), entrustable professional activities (EPAs), peer and patient assessments, and comment cards [35]. Most of these tools [29, 30, 36], including the famous Penn State College of Medicine Professionalism Questionnaire (PSCOM) [37], incorporate professionalism domains outlined by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM): accountability, excellence, duty, integrity, altruism, and respect for others [38]. The core professional values might remain the same, but online interaction differs significantly on issues such as privacy settings, data privacy, and professional virtual boundaries. An understanding of the digital professionalism domains is essential for establishing course contents and assessment tools. The major domains identified from the GMC social media guidelines “Doctor’s use of Social Media” [15] are particularly relevant to professionalism while using these sites.First four of these domains self-anonymity, privacy settings, maintaining boundaries and confidentiality, are related to patient-physician boundaries. According to Petronio’s communication privacy management theory, effective privacy management is essential for a balance between disclosure of information, privacy ownership, boundaries and control. Self-anonymity is related to the extent to which personal information is disclosed on personal and professional social media sites and the digital footprints one leave behind even when something is posted anonymously [39]. Similarly, the next two domain, privacy settings and maintaining virtual boundaries are conforming to the ownership and control over physician’s personal information while respecting privacy of patient as well [8]. When patients share information with healthcare professionals, they both become confidants and co-owner of information and thus maintaining confidentiality becomes essential to avoid privacy turbulence.Last four domains, conflict of interest, accountability, respect for colleagues, and ethics, relate to Azjen’s theory of planned behaviour. Being accountable for one’s actions, declaring conflict of interest, respecting colleague and ethical practice depends on digital norms, attitude towards use of SM and ability to exercise control while interacting digitally with patients [9].Similar domains have been highlighted by some recent studies [40,41,42,43,44,45,46]. These domains closely resemble major areas of professionalism with a main focus on the digital realm. Moreover, the items were constructed using multiple social media guidelines and thus, the items covered all aspects of digital professionalism for all HCPs to provide a holistic and comprehensive self-evaluation.The current literature showed three scales/questionnaires of digital professionalism designed for medical students. Marelić et al. developed and validated a scale to assess the attitudes of medical and dental students toward e-professionalism. Mosalanejad and Abdollahifard developed and validated a questionnaire to assess the professionalism of cyber users in medical sciences in Iran. A 15-item scale was developed and validated by Chisholm Burns et al. for assessing the online professionalism of pharmacy students.These studies used domains from previous studies and extracted factors through exploratory factor analysis (EFA). However, in our study, domains were identified from GMC, and thus, only CFA was performed due to certain expectations regarding the number of factors and their correlations [33]. This approach has been used previously in which CFA was performed to establish the construct validity of the teacher and student questionnaires to explore curriculum viability [22].During CFA, five items showed weak factor loading and correlations. One of the items, SA 2, “I describe my credentials while expressing my opinion on medical issues in blogs and forums”, showed weak loading, which might be because blogs and forums are among the same professionals, and they are already familiar with each other. Moreover, these forums are used sparingly in our setting, in which WhatsApp and Facebook emerged as the most popular platforms. Although AC item 5, “I keep in mind that any information I share online as a healthcare professional represents the medical profession at large and is trusted by the public,” showed weak loading, this item is important as whatever information HCPs post online is trusted by the public and is usually taken as the opinion of the medical profession at large. The item showed good, corrected item-total correlation (CITC) and was thus retained in the final instrument, as it was important in measuring the accountability domain.The main strength of our study was the extensive methodology that was followed according to instrument development guidelines reported in the literature. Moreover, reliability and internal consistency were established by taking responses from participants from multiple hospitals and institutes of the country with good representation of doctors, paramedical staff, and clinical pharmacists.This study was not without limitations. For Delphi rounds, international experts identified from the database were contacted through emails, but the response rate was low. Second, convenience sampling was performed for pilot testing instead of random sampling. Moreover, self-assessment instruments have limitations such as respondent bias and lack of observation.One of the avenues for potential future investigations is that the validity of the instrument is established on larger random samples from different professional groups, cultures and contexts countrywide and globally. Further research is required to design and implement courses incorporating digital professionalism to train future physicians, dentists, and paramedical staff for safe and professional online communication through social media. We also suggest an evaluation of the outcome of this self-assessment instrument in improving future digital practices of HCPs after training them.ConclusionSocial media awareness and familiarity with its use resonates as an essential skill for medical practitioners. Our findings suggest that the 28-item DP-SAI has an appropriate level of content, measures digital professionalism reliably, and represents the target population of HCPs. This is an important advancement in terms of reporting lapses in online conduct and will help in proposing solutions to enhance the quality of online professional communication through SM.\n Availability of data and materialsThe data generated and analysed during the study are available on request.

The natural rate of interest after the pandemic","byline":"by Gianluca Benigno, Boris Hofmann, Galo Nuño Barrau and Damiano Sandri","excerpt":"The natural rate, or r*, may have increased but much uncertainty remains, making it a blurry guidepost for monetary policy.","textContent":"Where is the natural rate of interest? How has it evolved? And where is it heading? In core advanced economies, several estimates of the natural rate have edged up. Shifts in the saving-investment balance and a more inflationary environment, which elicited a strong monetary policy response, may have been factors raising r* and perceptions thereof. The measurement of r* is, however, surrounded by very high uncertainty, making it a blurry guidepost for monetary policy. 1\nThe sharpest and most synchronised monetary tightening in decades has lifted policy rates from their decade-long historical lows (Graph 1.A). Against this background, there is an increasingly lively debate on whether policy rates adjusted for inflation (\"real rates\") will converge back to their pre-pandemic lows or to a higher level.\nViews differ widely. Some contributions posit that real rates will most likely return to low levels as unchanged powerful structural forces, including low potential growth, continue to hold them down (eg IMF (2023); Obstfeld (2023)). On the other hand, higher long-term real bond yields, reflecting in part higher distant forward real rates, suggest that at least investors expect higher real interest rates in the future (Graph 1.B). Likewise, the surprising resilience of economic activity to tighter monetary policy in the current cycle could be seen as an indication that the level of real policy rates that dampens demand is higher than previously thought.\nThis special feature contributes to this debate by assessing the natural rate of interest, commonly known as r*, in the post-pandemic era. The natural rate refers to the short-term real interest rate that would prevail in the absence of business cycle shocks, with output at potential, saving equating investment and stable inflation. Hence, the natural rate serves as a yardstick for where real policy interest rates are headed. It is also a benchmark for assessing the monetary policy stance \"looking through\" business cycle fluctuations. It can be conceived of as representing the intercept in a monetary policy rule, as in a \"Taylor rule\" (Taylor (1993)). Together with the long-run inflation rate, defined by the central bank inflation target, it pins down the long-run level of the nominal policy rate.\nSeveral estimates of the natural rate of interest (r*) suggest that it may have increased relative to pre-pandemic levels.\nPotential shifts in the saving-investment balance and a more inflationary environment, which elicited a strong monetary policy response, may have raised r* and perceptions thereof.\nAssessments of the level and direction of r* are surrounded by very high uncertainty, making it a blurry guidepost for monetary policy, especially in the current context.\nWe assess the post-pandemic natural rate from different perspectives. A review of various established measures of r* in core advanced economies suggests that it may indeed have increased. That said, there is considerable dispersion across estimates and high statistical uncertainty around individual estimates. The recent behaviour of the structural drivers of r* does not paint a clear-cut picture either. Low expected potential growth and rising longevity may continue to weigh on r*. Several other factors may exert upward pressure though, including persistently large fiscal deficits due to rising age-related spending as well as higher public investment needs for infrastructure, defence and the green transition. Moreover, and less often appreciated, monetary policy itself could have a non-negligible effect on natural rates and perceptions thereof, through debt accumulation and beliefs about r*. As such, the recent reemergence of upside inflation risks inducing a tighter monetary policy stance going forward may have pushed at least perceptions of r* higher.\nThe article proceeds as follows. The first section discusses the concept of the natural rate. In Section 2, we assess and compare different estimates of r* for the United States and the euro area. Section 3 looks at the long-run determinants of saving and investment as drivers of the natural rate, while Section 4 discusses the role of monetary policy. We end with a discussion of policy implications.\nThe concept of the natural rate of interest traces back at least to Wicksell (1898), who described it as the rate of interest that would equate saving and investment and be consistent with stable prices. In this vein, the natural rate is generally defined as the level of the short-term real interest rate that would prevail in the absence of business cycle fluctuations, with output at potential, saving equating investment and stable inflation (Borio (2021)).2\nThe natural rate is commonly thought to be determined by real forces that structurally affect the balance between actual and potential output, or equivalently between saving and investment. Specifically, factors that increase saving or decrease investment lower the natural rate. These include potential growth, demographic trends, inequality, shifts in savers' and investors' risk aversion and fiscal policy. Lower potential growth lowers investment by reducing the marginal return on capital and increases saving by lowering expected income. Longer life expectancy raises saving as households need to support a longer retirement. A lower dependency ratio – reflecting a higher share of working age people in the population – increases saving as those in the workforce typically save more than the young and the elderly. Higher inequality raises saving as richer households save a larger share of their income. Higher risk aversion induces higher saving, in particular in safe assets, and at the same time lowers investment. Finally, persistent fiscal deficits reduce aggregate saving.\nIn a globalised world economy, with free capital flows, the same considerations apply but at the global level. At the country level, saving-investment differences can be accommodated through current account deficits or surpluses. However, natural rates would still need to adjust to equate actual and potential output and saving and investment at the world level.\nThe natural rate is generally assumed to be independent of monetary policy. This reflects the principle that monetary policy is neutral in the long run and can affect real variables only in a transitory fashion. Instead, the natural rate should be seen as a guidepost for monetary policy as it encapsulates where real policy rates would be headed once the effects of business cycle shocks have petered out. The central bank sets the nominal short-term riskless rate directly and, given that prices are relatively \"sticky\", also the corresponding real rate at any and hence all points in time. This establishes a direct link to policy: to the extent that the natural rate defines good macroeconomic outcomes, if the central bank does its job, over time it will take the short-term rate towards r*.\nThe natural rate is an analytical concept. Since it is by nature unobservable, it can only be inferred through estimation, making any measurement of it a model-dependent exercise. Furthermore, operationalising the concept requires taking a stand on what the analytical long run without shocks corresponds to in calendar time. It is often assumed to refer to a horizon of five to 10 years.\nIn this vein, we consider a number of established estimates of r*, focusing on the United States and the euro area for reasons of data availability.3 The estimates considered are the following (see Box A for more details):\n(i) a semi-structural model-based measure from Holston et al (2023) (HLW)\n(ii) a time series model-based measure from Lubik and Matthes (2015) (LM)\n(iii) a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model-based measure from Del Negro et al (2017) (only for the US)\n(iv) a term structure model-based measure from Hördahl and Tristani (2014)\nWhile these estimates are often referred to as gauges of the natural rate, they may still reflect cyclical factors to some extent. Therefore, the focus should be on the trend movements of the measures, not on their short-term blips. Moreover, by their very nature, they mix to varying degrees signals about r* and perceptions of it, making it very hard to disentangle the two.\nA number of key observations emerge from the estimates (Graph 2). First, different approaches yield at times very different estimates of r*. The difference between the highest and lowest estimates is over 2 percentage points in several instances. Second, we observe a downward trend in natural rate estimates over the pre-pandemic decades, with estimates falling by several percentage points. Third, this downward trend shows signs of reversing post-pandemic: most measures display a significant increase over the past few years, in some cases to levels similar to those before the Great Financial Crisis (GFC). The HLW measure is the notable exception, falling back to pre-pandemic lows recently after an initial increase.\nThe uncertainty around r* estimates at the current juncture is very high. The latest difference between the highest and lowest estimates is about 1-2 percentage points (Graph 3.A). At the same time, there is also a high degree of uncertainty around the individual estimates. This is evident from the often large statistical confidence bands surrounding, for instance, the latest HLW and LM measures (Graph 3.B).\nLooking behind the estimates sheds some light on the reasons for the differences across approaches. For instance, the semi-structural HLW r* estimate is geared to an estimate of trend output growth. Estimated potential growth is therefore the key driver, although other factors not explicitly modelled have played an increasing role in the decline of the measure since the GFC, and also most recently (Graph 4). In the fully structural model of Del Negro et al (2017), shifts in risk aversion are a key driver of r*. The recent increase in this estimate reflects a pickup in risk appetite associated with lower risk spreads in financial markets (Baker et al (2023)). The time series estimates of LM are in part driven by current and past dynamics of growth, inflation and real interest rates. The same applies to the term structure model-based estimate as it depends in part on long-horizon forecasts of the policy rate and inflation. Current macroeconomic developments may obviously also affect the survey-based estimates.\nA complementary approach to assess the recent direction of the natural rate is to examine more broadly the evolution of the long-run drivers of saving and investment.\nThe secular decline in real interest rates in the four decades before the pandemic was linked to long-run forces that lifted saving and depressed investment. Among these, lower potential growth rates and population ageing pushing saving up and investment down were particularly important drivers according to a number of recent studies (Gagnon et al (2021); Cesa-Bianchi et al (2023); IMF (2023)). Another key factor was arguably high saving rates in rapidly growing emerging market economies (EMEs), the so called global \"saving glut\" (Bernanke (2005)). Greater demand for safe assets in the wake of greater risk aversion after the GFC was identified as yet another important factor putting downward pressure on r* in major advanced economies (Caballero et al (2017); Marx et al (2021); Del Negro et al (2017)). Finally, fiscal policy was probably a countervailing force, reducing aggregate saving and sustaining aggregate demand and thereby limiting the decline in natural rates (Rachel and Summers (2019)).\nWhy so low for so long? A long-term view of real interest rates\nWhat are the implications of the recent evolution of key drivers? The picture is unclear. Some developments point to r* remaining at low pre-pandemic levels. Trend real growth has remained anaemic globally for two decades and does not show signs of acceleration (Graph 5.A). There is speculation that the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence may boost productivity growth, but it is too early to assess how realistic these hopes are. At the same time, after a brief dip during the Covid pandemic, life expectancy keeps increasing in both advanced and emerging market economies (Graph 5.B).\nHowever, other developments point to a potential increase in natural rates. Dependency ratios are rising in advanced economies as the baby boomer generation enters retirement and are flattening out in EMEs (Graph 5.B). Fiscal deficits have ballooned in the wake of the pandemic and, absent fiscal consolidation, are poised to increase further on the back of higher age-related spending (Graph 5.C). Additional public spending needs will probably arise from the need to support the green transition and higher defence spending given geopolitical tensions.4 The adoption of new technologies, green or digital, may also boost private investment. Furthermore, growing geopolitical fragmentation could roll back financial globalisation, thus mitigating the global saving glut effect on natural rates in core advanced economies.\nIn sum, a qualitative assessment of the evolution of saving-investment drivers suggests that few are pointing towards continued low r* and a number towards higher r*. On balance, a higher post-pandemic r* can therefore not be ruled out, but uncertainty again looms large.\nAn additional source of uncertainty of the assessment concerns the significance and stability of the linkages between r* and its potential drivers. Empirically, the relationships between real interest rates and the key saving-investment forces discussed so far are often not statistically significant and unstable over time (Hamilton et al (2016); Lunsford and West (2019); Borio et al (2022)). This cautions against drawing firm conclusions about the evolution of r* from developments in saving and investment drivers.\nThe assessment of r* is further complicated by the possibility that the natural rate, or at least perceptions of it, are influenced by monetary policy. To be sure, much standard macroeconomic theory rules this out based on models in which money is \"neutral\", ie it cannot have an impact on real variables in steady state. That said, regardless of the model specifics, it is possible that monetary policy has at least very long-lasting effects on real variables. These would be quite similar to, or hardly distinguishable from, changes in r*.\nSome recent studies point to the possibility that expansionary monetary policy may raise r*. Long-lasting positive effects on aggregate demand, so-called \"hysteresis effects\", could boost innovation and growth (eg Benigno and Fornaro (2018); Jordà et al (2020)). Furthermore, a supportive monetary policy stance could yield improvements in resource allocation across firms, boosting productivity (Baqaee et al (2021); Gonzalez et al (2023)). That said, given prolonged monetary accommodation in the wake of the GFC, these channels do not seem to have materially affected the downward trend in r* according to essentially all estimates over this period, as documented above.\nBy contrast, through the interaction with the financial cycle, prolonged expansionary monetary policy could lower r* over long horizons. This is because monetary policy has a major impact on debt and asset price dynamics.5 Prolonged monetary easing could therefore fuel debt accumulation and financial imbalances. This could push down r* because high debt burdens can weigh heavily on demand (Mian et al (2021)). At the same time, financial imbalances often usher in financial crises, which have very persistent, if not permanent, effects on economic activity (Borio and Disyatat (2014); Kashyap and Stein (2023)). The risk of such developments playing out is higher when inflation remains subdued and fails to signal unsustainable expansions, eg owing to structural forces that keep it down, such as globalisation. From this perspective, low pre-pandemic interest rates may have been – at least in part – the result of progressive monetary policy easing over sequential business cycles pushing real interest rates down and indebtedness up in a context of low inflation (Graph 6.A).6\nA role for monetary policy in affecting r* could also be suggested by the apparent long-lasting influence of monetary policy on long-term real interest rates. The overall decline in US long-term real yields since the late 1990s appears to have been driven to a large extent by yield changes around monetary policy announcements (Graph 6.B). This indicates that financial market participants take a cue from policy decisions when assessing where real rates will go over long horizons – implicitly, r* – and that, over time, those changes do not vanish.\nThis finding can be interpreted in different ways. On the one hand, it may reflect fundamental news from the central bank guiding markets to the true r* (Hillenbrand (2023)). On the other hand, it could reflect information feedback loops with financial markets. They can occur whenever r* is hard to measure and both central banks and market participants need to learn about it from each other. Such loops can induce shifts in perceived r* despite no independent shifts in saving and investment (Rungcharoenkitkul and Winkler (2021)).7 Shifts in perceived r*, in turn, could affect r* to the extent that they influence spending decisions. That said, monetary policy announcements do not seem to have played an important role in the surge in real yields over the past few years (Graph 6.B).\nThese considerations have two main implications. First, the possibility that r* may be influenced by monetary policy further complicates the operationalisation of the concept. Second, r*, or at least perceptions thereof embedded in market prices, may have risen relative to pre-pandemic years because of expectations of a prospectively tighter monetary policy in a structurally more inflationary environment. For instance, adverse supply side developments in the global economy (Carstens (2022)) could reduce monetary policy's leeway to remain as accommodative during economic expansions as in the past, reducing the risk of the build-up of financial imbalances and their downward pressure on r* over long horizons.\nThe analysis in this special feature suggests that r*, or at least perceptions of it, may have risen post-pandemic, but that its assessment is surrounded by a very high degree of uncertainty. These findings caution against over-reliance on r* as a guide for monetary policy.\nThe uncertainty surrounding r* suggests that it is a blurry guidepost for assessing the monetary policy stance and hence the tightness of monetary policy, in particular at the current juncture. In this context, it appears advisable to guide policy decisions based more firmly on observed inflation rather than on highly uncertain estimates of the natural rate.\nUncertainty about r* also underscores the need for robust monetary policy frameworks. They need to be fit for purpose regardless of the broad economic environment and associated estimates of r*. The expectation of the persistence of a very low r*, and hence of a high incidence of the effective lower bound, was a key consideration behind the review of monetary policy frameworks pre-Covid. The last couple of years have highlighted how quickly the environment, and associated views of r*, can change.\nBaker, K, L Casey, M Del Negro, A Gleich and R Nallamotu (2023): \"The evolution of short-run r* after the pandemic\", Liberty Street Economics, 10 August.\nBanerjee, R N, and B Hofmann (2018): \"The rise of zombie firms: causes and consequences\", BIS Quarterly Review, September, pp 67–78.\nBank for International Settlements (BIS) (2023): \"Monetary and fiscal policy: safeguarding stability and trust\", Annual Economic Report 2023, Chapter II.\nBaqaee, D, E Farhi and K Sangani (2021): \"The supply-side effects of monetary policy\", NBER Working Paper, no 28345.\nBenigno, G, L Fornaro (2018): \"Stagnation traps\", The Review of Economic Studies, vol 85, pp 1425–70.\nBernanke, B (2005): \"The global saving glut and the U.S. current account deficit\", Sandridge Lecture, Virginia Association of Economists, Richmond, Virginia, 10 March.\nBorio, C (2021): \"Navigating by r*: safe or hazardous?\", BIS Working Papers, no 982.\nBorio, C and P Disyatat (2014): \"Low interest rates and secular stagnation: is debt a missing link?\", VoxEU, 25 June.\nBorio, C, P Disyatat and P Rungcharoenkitkul (2019): \"What anchors for the natural interest rate of interest?\", BIS Working Papers, no 777.\nBorio, C, P Disyatat, M Juselius and P Rungcharoenkitkul (2022): \"Why so low for so long?

All remaining errors are ours.\n2   The natural rate definition followed in this special feature should not be confused with alternative concepts of equilibrium interest rates that depend on business cycle fluctuations. For example, in Woodford (2003) the natural rate corresponds to the short-term real rate in a counterfactual economy without nominal rigidities but subject to business cycle fluctuations. See also the discussion in Obstfeld (2023), who distinguishes between the natural rate and the neutral rate, the latter being the interest rate consistent with no inflationary or disinflationary pressure.\n3   Since real interest rates and estimates of r* tend to be closely correlated across countries (Del Negro et al (2019); Cesa-Bianchi et al (2023)), the developments in the two major global economies should be broadly representative. See Brand et al (2024) for a comparison of a broader range of r* measures for the euro area.\n4    However, if growing public debt on the back of rising deficits would at some point raise risks to fiscal sustainability, the result could be downward pressure on natural rates due to the required fiscal adjustments or the aftermath of sovereign crises.\n5   See eg Hofmann and Peersman (2017) for evidence for the United States.\n6   See Borio et al (2019), Borio (2021) and BIS (2023) for more detailed discussions. A reinforcing effect could be the negative impact on potential output from the existence of persistently unprofitable firms (\"zombie firms\") supported by very low interest rates (Banerjee and Hofmann (2018)).\n7   For example, when the central bank cuts the policy rate sharply, market participants may attribute part of the reduction to a lower r* in the reaction function. The central bank, in turn, may misinterpret lower market yields as indicating a lower r*, and hence cut the rate further. This \"hall of mirrors\" interaction can lead to persistent shifts in r* itself.","length":30871,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,7,8,7,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the natural rate of interest post-pandemic, including discussions on the concept of the natural rate, different estimates of r* for the United States and the euro area, long-run determinants of saving and investment, the role of monetary policy, and the potential factors influencing the natural rate.

But there's no evidence directly linking these images to Mr Trump's campaign.The co-founder of Black Voters Matter, a group which encourages black people to vote, said the manipulated images were pushing a \"strategic narrative\" designed to show Mr Trump as popular in the black community.A creator of one of the images told the BBC: \"I'm not claiming it's accurate.\"The fake images of black Trump supporters, generated by artificial intelligence (AI), are one of the emerging disinformation trends ahead of the US presidential election in November.Unlike in 2016, when there was evidence of foreign influence campaigns, the AI-generated images found by the BBC appear to have been made and shared by US voters themselves.One of them was Mark Kaye and his team at a conservative radio show in Florida. They created an image of Mr Trump smiling with his arms around a group of black women at a party and shared it on Facebook, where Mr Kaye has more than one million followers. At first it looks real, but on closer inspection everyone's skin is a little too shiny and there are missing fingers on people's hands - some tell-tale signs of AI-created images.\"I'm not a photojournalist,\" Mr Kaye tells me from his radio studio.\"I'm not out there taking pictures of what's really happening. I'm a storyteller.\"Image caption, Radio show host Mark Kaye told the BBC that it was the individual's problem if their vote was influenced by AI imagesHe had posted an article about black voters supporting Mr Trump and attached this image to it, giving the impression that these people all support the former president's run for the White House.In the comments on Facebook, several users appeared to believe the AI image was real. \"I'm not claiming it is accurate. I'm not saying, 'Hey, look, Donald Trump was at this party with all of these African American voters. Look how much they love him!'\" he said. \"If anybody's voting one way or another because of one photo they see on a Facebook page, that's a problem with that person, not with the post itself.\"Another widely viewed AI image the BBC investigation found shows Mr Trump posing with black voters on a front porch. It had originally been posted by a satirical account that generates images of the former president, but only gained widespread attention when it was reposted with a new caption falsely claiming that he had stopped his motorcade to meet these people. Image source, AI-GENERATED IMAGEImage caption, This image was widely viewed on social media with a caption saying Trump had stopped his motorcade to pose with these menWe tracked down the person behind the account called Shaggy, who is a committed Trump supporter living in Michigan.\"[My posts] have attracted thousands of wonderful kind-hearted Christian followers,\" he said in messages sent to the BBC on social media.When I tried to question him on the AI-generated image he blocked me. His post has had over 1.3 million views, according to the social media site X. Some users called it out, but others seemed to have believed the image was real.I did not find similarly manipulated images of Joe Biden with voters from a particular demographic. The AI images of the president tend to feature him alone or with other world leaders such as Russian President Vladimir Putin or former US President Barack Obama.Some are created by critics, others by supporters. In January, the Democratic candidate was himself a victim of an AI-generated impersonation. An automated audio call, purportedly voiced by the president, urged voters to skip the New Hampshire primary where he was running. A Democratic Party supporter has admitted responsibility, saying he wanted to draw attention to the potential for the technology to be abused.Cliff Albright, the co-founder of campaign group Black Voters Matter, said there appeared to be a resurgence of disinformation tactics targeting the black community, as in the 2020 election.\"There have been documented attempts to target disinformation to black communities again, especially younger black voters,\" he said.Image caption, Cliff Albright, who runs an organisation encouraging black people to vote, says younger black voters are targeted for disinformationI show him the AI-generated pictures in his office in Atlanta, Georgia - a key election battleground state where convincing even a small slice of the overall black vote to switch from Mr Biden to Mr Trump could prove decisive. A recent New York Times and Sienna College poll found that in six key swing states 71% of black voters would back Mr Biden in 2024, a steep drop from the 92% nationally that helped him win the White House at the last election.Mr Albright said the fake images were consistent with a \"very strategic narrative\" pushed by conservatives - from the Trump campaign down to influencers online - designed to win over black voters. They are particularly targeting young black men, who are thought to be more open to voting for Mr Trump than black women.On Monday, MAGA Inc, the main political action committee backing Trump, is due to launch an advertising campaign targeting black voters in Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.It is aimed at voters like Douglas, a taxi driver in Atlanta. Justin Webb and Marianna Spring travel from the frozen plains of Iowa to the swing state of Georgia to explore Donald Trump's enduring appeal and look ahead to an unprecedented American election year.Watch on BBC One at 20:00 on Monday 4 March (20:30 in Wales and Northern Ireland) - and later on iPlayer. Douglas said he was mainly worried about the economy and immigration - issues which he felt Trump was more focused on. He said Democratic messaging about Trump's threat to democracy would not motivate him to vote, because he was already disillusioned with the electoral process.The US economy is generally doing well, but some voters - like Douglas - don't feel better off because they've also been through a cost of living crisis.What did he think of the AI-generated image of Trump sitting on a front porch with black voters? When I first showed it to him, he believed it was real. He said it bolstered his view, shared by some other black people he knows, that Trump is supportive of the community. Then, I revealed it was a fake.\"Well, that's the thing about social media. It's so easy to fool people,\" he said. Image caption, \"It's so easy to fool people\" on social media, says cab driver Douglas, after viewing one of the AI fakesDisinformation tactics in the US presidential elections have evolved since 2016, when Donald Trump won. Back then, there were documented attempts by hostile foreign powers, such as Russia, to use networks of inauthentic accounts to try to sow division and plant particular ideas. In 2020, the focus was on home-grown disinformation - particularly false narratives that the presidential election was stolen, which were shared widely by US-based social media users and endorsed by Mr Trump and other Republican politicians. In 2024, experts warn of a dangerous combination of the two. Image source, AI-GENERATED IMAGEImage caption, At first glance, some voters miss the tell-tale signs of an AI-generated image - which sometimes can include extra armsBen Nimmo, who until last month was responsible for countering foreign influence operations at Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, said the confusion created by fakes like these also opens new opportunities for foreign governments who may seek to manipulate elections.\"Anybody who has a substantial audience in 2024 needs to start thinking, how do I vet anything which gets sent to me? How do I make sure that I don't unwittingly become part of some kind of foreign influence operation?\" he said.Mr Nimmo said that social media users and platforms are increasingly able to identify fake automated accounts, so as it gets harder to build an audience in this way \"operations try to co-opt real people\" to increase the reach of divisive or misleading information.\"The best bet they have is to try and land [their content] through an influencer. That's anyone who has a big audience on social media,\" he said.Mr Nimmo said he was concerned in 2024 that these people, who may be willing to spread misinformation to their ready-made audiences, could become \"unwitting vectors\" for foreign influence operations. These operations could share content with users - either covertly or overtly - and encourage them to post it themselves, so it appears to have come from a real US voter, he said. All of the major social media companies have policies in place to tackle potential influence operations, and several - like Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram - have introduced new measures to deal with AI-generated content during elections. Leading politicians from around the world have also highlighted the risks of AI-generated content this year. Narratives about the 2020 election being stolen - which were shared without any evidence - spread online with simple posts, memes and algorithms, not AI-generated images or video, and still resulted in the US Capitol riot on 6 January.This time around, there is a whole new range of tools available to political partisans and provocateurs which could inflame tensions once again.

The states of Bihar, Jharkhand, and eastern Uttar Pradesh also suffered the impact of the cyclone, which was categorised as a ‘very severe’ cyclonic storm as soon as it made landfall near Balasore district in Odisha on 26 May. Although a massive evacuation drive prior to landfall minimised casualties, the state government estimated that the storm affected 6 million people in 11,000 villages and caused damages to infrastructure amounting to losses of some INR 6.1 billion.[1]\nSradhanjali Pattanaik, 25, was born and raised in Chanuri, a village of 300 people in Bhadrak district, Odisha. For as long as she can remember, Sradhanjali’s father, a farmer, had imparted to her a deep understanding of the community’s vulnerability to disasters. Bhadrak is under the constant threat of cyclonic storms that form in the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon season.[2] Often, heavy rainfall, accompanied by cyclonic storms, would lead to flooding in low-lying regions from the catchment areas of Baitarani River. In the past 16 years, the district has witnessed no less than eleven floodings and three massive cyclones.\nSradhanjali remembers her father’s accounts of the first cyclone their family experienced in 1999, when she was a toddler. Those stories left a mark on her and, looking back, she feels they ignited in her a passion to take part in disaster response.\nIn college, Sradhanjali participated in a two-day course on preparedness that gave her knowledge and skills. In 2014, she attended a one-week training camp that not only increased her awareness but also connected her with like-minded individuals. \nIn 2019, she became a Reliance Foundation Youth Volunteer and began her active involvement in disaster response. She joined training programmes, which continued virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic.[a] She helped raise awareness about the health emergency and, along with other volunteers, distributed masks to the community.\nSradhanjali worked hard, continuing with her volunteer work as she managed her part-time teaching job. Proving herself to be an inspiring figure, she managed to enlist the support of 15 other young women and men from the community, including her younger brother. Her dedication to supporting her community before and during calamities also included actively engaging in relief efforts in and around Chanuri village. With the help of pre-cyclone advisories received from Reliance Foundation, she was well-informed about the cyclone details, including the time and place of landfall. She focused her efforts on reaching out to communities in various flood-prone areas.\nSradhanjali encountered challenges to her work with the cyclone-affected communities. After evacuation, they received rations for people in shelters. However, volunteers were needed for transporting the rations to the shelters. Despite the risks posed by the cyclonic storm, Sradhanjali and her friends took it upon themselves to personally move the rations.\nDuring another cyclone, Sradhanjali witnessed the neighbouring family narrowly escaping harm when a large tree fell in their backyard. As the public services were already overwhelmed dealing with communication and electricity issues, rescue efforts were delayed. The community came together and, using household tools, cleared the backyard of the fallen tree.\nSradhanjali’s parents often express concern for her safety, but at the same time, they have always been proud of what she does and offer her their support. While her mother wishes for her to delegate certain tasks to individuals whom she feels would be better equipped to handle them, she acknowledges Sradhanjali’s role as a beacon of hope for their community in times of crises. Says Sradhanjali, “When they have problems, they come and find me, and we try to solve it together.” Her commitment to her community and her willingness to confront challenges head-on demonstrate her invaluable role as a reliable support system during difficult times.\nSradhanjali shows the impact that a single leader—with enough heart and passion—can have on a community. By supporting and empowering individuals through targeted disaster preparedness trainings, it becomes possible to initiate a positive ripple effect that extends to the entire community. \nThe crucial role of capacity building for community leaders: Building knowledge and skills among local community leaders through even short-term training courses can equip them for the difficult task of disaster preparedness and response. When a leader possesses the necessary knowledge and skills, they become catalysts for change and are able to inspire others. By providing focused trainings to these leaders, they gain the tools and understanding to effectively engage their community, raise awareness about potential risks, and implement preparedness measures. \nThe value of community support during emergencies: The support and involvement of the community are vital in driving effective disaster response. Sradhanjali’s collaboration with other young people from her community exemplifies the power of collective action and community support in extending humanitarian assistance.\nTHIS STORY OF Sradhanjali is a modified version of a chapter that appeared in ‘Stronger Together: A Compendium of Stories of Courage and Resilience During Disasters’, jointly published by Reliance Foundation and Sphere India and launched on 22 February.[3] The publication highlights the imperative of building resilience during disasters by telling the stories of exceptional individuals whose efforts in humanitarian work have rallied their communities to work together and, consequently, grow stronger.\n‘Stronger Together’ documents the stories of ten individuals who have shown courage and leadership in response to the challenges and the growing local needs in aftermath of a disaster or a recurring calamity. The volume highlights the replicability of actions described in the stories. The manner in which local leaders function, the approach of the community in responding to the calamity, and the lessons learnt from their efforts, can be applied across regions given an enabling environment.\nIndeed, the stories of individuals like Sradhanjali can inspire communities not only in India but in other parts of the world. After all, according to the Global Risks Report 2021, extreme weather events, climate action failure, and human-led environmental damage will only intensify in the next 10 years.[4]\nINDIA IS ALREADY witnessing these events. Over the recent years, the country has seen a concerning surge in climate change-induced disasters, posing challenges to the country’s overall resilience. India is a climate-sensitive country and experiences various calamities, such as floods, droughts, cyclones, and heatwaves, which have become more frequent and intense due to climate change. Some recent examples include the devastation caused by Cyclone Tauktae in 2021 in the southern parts of India, the displacement of people and damage to property during the floods in Assam and Bengaluru in 2022, heatwaves in Northern India, and the forest fires in Nagaland and in different regions across Uttarakhand.\nWhile India has been taking concerted efforts to deal with these climate change-induced disasters, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic had far-reaching ramifications on lives and livelihoods, and the overall social and economic fabric of communities across the world. While biological disasters primarily affect humans, there has been a rising incidence of diseases amongst animals, such as the Lumpy Skin Disease that affects cattle and the Nipa virus that afflicts pigs as well as humans. These diseases cause economic losses that impact the livelihoods of people dependent on livestock, and health and sanitation concerns for the people in the community.\nThe escalating frequency of disasters presents a pressing challenge for all nations, but more particularly for countries like India, where developmental challenges are more acute. The urgency of the task has prompted the government to adopt a comprehensive approach that integrates climate   resilience, disaster management, and public health strategies.\nTo be sure, investing in resilience and adaptation to avoid costs of hazard impacts is an imperative across the globe, as underscored by the United Nations GAR Special Report 2023. These efforts will save lives and resources. The same report calls attention to the need to act effectively to mitigate the impacts of a so-called ‘polycrisis’, describing how the impacts of climate change are causing existing hazard events to become more intense and frequent, creating compound and cascading crises.\nIn 2016, the Prime Minister of India released a 10-point agenda on Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) to address the need for enhanced resilience against disasters. The agenda on DRR serves as a guiding framework for enhancing the country’s resilience against disasters. It emphasises the vital role of sustained and collective action in strengthening communities against disasters, while also acknowledging the importance of local organisations that have an acute understanding of local needs, challenges, and capacities. This approach fosters a resilient society capable of withstanding and overcoming challenges.\nIn this regard, ‘Stronger Together: A Compendium of Stories of Courage & Resilience During Disasters’ was published to serve as a powerful source of inspiration and courage to better prepare for and respond to disasters in India. This aligns with the core aspects of the 10-point agenda, particularly Point 9: “Make use of every opportunity to learn from disasters.”\nThe compendium captured specific best practices adopted by individuals and communities at the grassroots for response to, and mitigation of disaster impacts in different parts of India, supported by local organisations in building capacities of these individuals and in assisting them to thrive through adversities. Their stories of courage exhibit resilience in the face of crisis and acknowledges the Agenda’s Point 8, which focuses on building local capacities to enhance disaster risk reduction.\nIdentifying the need for participatory decision-making in disaster management, the National Platform   for   Disaster   Risk   Reduction (NPDRR) was constituted by the Government of India in 2013. The theme of the 3rd session, in 2023, “Building Local Resilience in a Changing Climate”, reflects the need for localising disaster risk management at a time when disaster risks are not only increasing but new patterns are emerging. While building local capabilities is indispensable for resilience, equally critical is the localisation of disaster risk reduction efforts.  Representing local expertise, communities at the grassroots possess a sensitive understanding of local needs, challenges, and capacities. ‘Stronger Together’ highlights the efforts of local communities to respond to the increasing frequency of disasters, in order to save lives, minimise impacts, and build resilient frameworks to face future disastrous events.\nOne of themes of the 3rd session of the NPDRR focused on enabling women’s leadership, which is also aligned with the agenda’s Point 3: “Women’s leadership and greater involvement should be central to disaster risk management.” ‘Stronger Together’ recognises these objectives and captured stories of women at the grassroots, portraying courage in response to disasters, building trust relationships across communities, and acknowledging that gender equality is a pillar of any effort to empower communities.\nDuring emergencies, the delivery of relief support can take many months due to disruptions in the supply chain and restricted movement, as witnessed during the COVID-19 emergency. In response to such adversities, therefore, it is crucial for communities to lead themselves out of danger and foster a practice of disaster resilience and risk management through coordinated support and assistance from local organisations, local leaders, and government response agencies.\nTHE TEN STORIES contained in ‘Stronger Together’ offer valuable lessons in shaping future strategies and efforts to strengthen the resilience of communities.\nNurturing local resilience by empowering the grassroots through trainings and capacity building, with the aim of fostering a network of capable responders. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for training and knowledge sharing on psychosocial support and counselling of children and families affected by the crisis, thus empowering communities to thrive amid challenges, and ensuring their sustainable growth and well-being.\nHarnessing the power of multi-stakeholder partnerships. Community-led partnership models guided by a multi-stakeholder collaborative approach are a key to strengthening the resilience of local communities across India, offering innovative frameworks for sustaining livelihood opportunities. The establishment of the Mahila Sangh (Women’s Self-Help Group) is a testament to the importance of multi-stakeholder partnerships in bolstering community resilience.\nFostering local leadership for resilience at the grassroots. During emergencies, the presence of capable local leaders becomes paramount as they can effectively lead and provide support to affected communities. Notably, local    leaders    play   a   vital role in mobilising communities, identifying immediate needs, and providing essential relief and assistance to affected populations. By embracing community-led partnerships, locals can be equipped to actively participate in their own resilience-building processes, paving the way for sustainable progress and a brighter future.\nRaising awareness through demonstration programmes. Educating communities about disaster risks, early warning systems, and the preparation of flood survival kits is vital. Through the dedicated efforts of community workers and enhanced community preparedness, reliance on external aid and government support during disasters can be reduced. This enables communities to handle crises effectively and increases their ability to respond to and recover from adversities.\nImportance of co-production of knowledge. With more context-sensitive knowledge production, there is considerable opportunity to integrate local knowledge, positive traditional practices, and understanding of local priorities and perceptions. It also leads to the provision of improved, target-oriented methods of communication in location-specific contexts. Most of all, local knowledge is a critical social element of the adaptive capacity and resilience of communities.\nThe significance of the knowledge-sharing process. Localised sharing and exchange of knowledge through ‘learning communities’, particularly on how they mitigate disasters through traditional knowledge, can be a crucial element in the process of building resilient communities.\nAdapting human systems and making them more climate resilient. Strengthening the capacity of local systems to cope with and recover from climate shocks is crucial for ensuring well-being and prosperity in a changing climate.\n[a] The trainings were organised by Reliance Foundation, in collaboration with the Odisha State Disaster Management Authority and the Civil Defence Organization.\n[1] Kheyali Roy and Shaurya Prakash, “Impact of Disaster ‘YAAS’: A Case Study of the Coastal Areas in Odisha,” Empower - The Journal of Social Work 2, no. 2 (2021), http://kaps.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Impact-of-Disaster-YAAS-A-case-study-of-the-coastal-areas-in- Odisha-by-Kheyali-Roy-and-Shaurya-Prakash.pdf\n[2] District Disaster Management Authority, Bhadrak, “District Disaster Management Plan, Bhadrak” (2023-24), https://www.osdma.org/district­plan/bhadrak/#gsc.tab=0\n[3] Jayashree B. et al., Stronger Together: A Compendium of Stories of Courage and Resilience During Disasters, Reliance Foundation and Sphere India, February 22, 2024, https://www.orfonline.org/research/stronger-together-a-compendium-of-stories-of-courage-and-resilience-during-disasters\n[4] World Economic Forum, Global Risks Report 2021, January 19, 2021, https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-global-risks-report-2021/\nThe views expressed above belong to the author(s).

Steven Cerant, 46.\n“A key duty of a Crown prosecutor is to assess cases on an ongoing basis and ensure all aspects of the evidence are carefully considered at every stage of a prosecution,” said a statement from the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service on Thursday.\n“In general, Crown assessment of files continue to evolve after the initial decision is made to lay charges, and Crown prosecutors continue to evaluate the evidence in light of the prosecution standard. In this matter, it was determined the file did not meet the standard for prosecution and the charge of assault was stayed on Feb. 26.”\nThe officer was charged following an investigation stemming from a March 3, 2023 incident in which police were called to a break-and-enter in Red Deer.\nDuring the arrest of a suspect, officers were allegedly assaulted and sprayed with bear spray.

It’s beyond the outfield fence, some 400 feet away from home plate. It’s not normal for high school hitters to deposit balls onto its surface.Then again, Arjun Nimmala is not normal in the classic sense of the word. The 17-year-old shortstop is one of the highest-ranked baseball players in the country. When the MLB Draft starts on Sunday, he is expected to be one of the first high school players off the board.GO DEEPERKeith Law's MLB Mock Draft 3.0: Flamethrower Paul Skenes to the Pirates at No. 1So let’s go back in his senior season, to the day he put a charge into a ball that sailed through the air above his hometown field, over the outfield fence and onto that highway. His high school coach, Eric Beattie, said the game was tied at 3-3 when Nimmala came to the plate. There were two runners on base and Nimmala got a good pitch to hit. The ball was a goner.“That’s probably the moment in a game that stands out more than any other time he’s had,” Beattie said. “He’s obviously performed very well on a lot of different occasions but that particular hit was pretty incredible and it was in a big moment against a team that was undefeated at the time. We went on to win the game and it was kind of a momentum changer.Read Keith Law’s latest MLB mock draft.“It was fun to watch. Even the coach we played against was saying how fun that was to watch.”It was even more fun considering the type of player who hit the bomb. Nimmala, a right-handed hitter, isn’t a big-bodied slugger. He’s a 6-foot-1, 180-or-so-pound shortstop who has yet to fill out his frame. He batted .479 with six home runs and posted a .573 on-base percentage as a senior at Strawberry Crest. He shouldn’t hit with as much strength as he does. Yet there he was dumping a baseball onto a distant highway.\nArjun Nimmala…..the tool set and wiry body are reminiscent of a young Alfonso Soriano. #MLBDraft23 pic.twitter.com/F1HzaMnZSQ\n— MLB Draft Room (@MLBDraftRoom) June 29, 2023Nimmala’s present power is one of the reasons he is rated eighth in The Athletic’s Keith Law’s ranking of draft-eligible prospects.

He’s a good 20, 30 pounds lighter than some of those guys.“He works hard and he’s gotten the most out of where he’s at right now. He’s gotten the most out of it but very few people reach their full build at 17 years old. He’s got a lot of growing in front of him and he goes about the process the right way. I think the average male, based on the general population, usually peaks at 26, 27 years old.

They discussed technical, regulatory and economic barriers to unlocking flexibility at the level of individual household consumers.\nFurthermore, they identified electrification of industries and cross-border interconnection as large-scale means of flexibility. To conclude, they also exchanged views on any possible changes to national tariff systems for transmission and distribution grid operators, following the recent electricity market reform, as a way to incentivise flexibility.\nOver lunch, ministers discussed the state of the solar power sector in Europe. They discussed the important contribution that solar photovoltaics can bring to the decoupling of Russian fossil fuels by 2027 (under the REPowerEU plan, it is expected that it could replace 9bcm of gas).\nMinisters took well note of the explanations by the invited guests from Solar Power Europe and the European Solar Manufacturing Council. They commented the impressive acceleration that took place in the deployment of solar photovoltaics all over Europe, while also taking note that the Commission considers that more needs to be done.\nMinisters also broadly supported the development and implementation of actions to support and scale up the European solar manufacturing, inter alia through a focus on innovation and targeted auctions, while many warned against restrictive measures on solar imports.\nUnder any other business, the Commission informed ministers about the progress made by member states with a view to achieving the 2030 objectives for energy and climate.\nMinisters were also informed about the energy situation in Ukraine by Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko (via VTC).\nThe Lithuanian delegation called on the European Commission to explore any urgent action and put forward the necessary legislative proposals to enforce the deadline of 1 January 2027 at the latest for phasing out gas imports, including LNG from Russia, while insisting that such legislation should empower member states to take the necessary measures at national level to meet such a deadline.\nThe Austrian, Czech, Hungarian and Slovakian energy ministers provided information about the impacts of the gas storage neutrality charge and the need for better coordination at European level.\nThe Council also adopted without discussion the items on the lists of legislative and non-legislative A items.","length":6044,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,9,7,8,8,7],"reason":"The article scores high on accuracy as it provides detailed information on the discussions, agreements, and decisions made during the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council meeting.

Leaders frequently travel for various reasons and engage with counterparts who align with their strategic priorities and national interests.”The trip is seen as part of Orbán’s long-running effort to become a central figure in an international conservative movement.“For him, it’s just a big, big moment in his foreign policy importance, and also he could hope that it makes him more serious in the eyes of others,” said Péter Krekó, the director of the Budapest-based Political Capital research institute, noting that countries of Hungary’s size did not usually get much attention from US leaders.The Hungarian government – which maintains relationships with Moscow and Beijing, still employs former communist security officials and is known for its tendency to skew business competition at home – does not fit in well with traditional American conservatives. The late Republican John McCain described Orbán in 2014 as “a neo-fascist dictator”.Nevertheless, Orbán’s team have spent a significant amount of time and money on cultivating relationships with a different strand of US conservatives.The Hungarian government has in recent years hired US consultancies with conservative links to help improve its image.The Hungarian embassy in Washington has also been directly involved in the outreach: for example, it hosted the former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy twice in the past year.Last year the prime minister himself hosted Americans who travelled for the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Hungary at a reception in his office.Meanwhile, a network of Hungarian state-funded thinktanks and foundations fund jobs and fellowships for well-connected conservative American pundits and academics.Balázs Orbán has defended this approach. “In line with our connectivity strategy, we aim to cultivate relations in all directions and aspire to establish Hungary as an intellectual hub in the heart of Europe,” he said. ”The Hungarian leader’s positioning has not gone unnoticed among US officials. In an interview with the Guardian earlier this year, the US ambassador in Budapest, David Pressman, said the Hungarian government was pursuing a “fantasy” foreign policy.Orbán’s American fans have pushed back against the administration’s approach to Hungary and defended his decision to visit Trump. Gladden Pappin, a conservative academic who serves as president of the state-owned Hungarian Institute of International Affairs and is set to join Orbán on the trip, said in a phone interview that “in some way, this kind of visit indicates that the relationship has been unnecessarily politicised, particularly by the American side”.A former associate professor at the University of Dallas who moved to Hungary in recent years, Pappin argued that “there has been this weaponisation of diplomacy against Hungary on account of its conservative nature”.He added: “I think all of us, you know, on the right side of the aisle from an American standpoint, would hope for normalisation of that relationship if Trump is elected.”","length":6531,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T13:00:00.000Z","rating":[5,4,6,4,6,5,6],"reason":"The article provides a factual account of Viktor Orbán's upcoming visit to Donald Trump in Florida and the background leading up to the meeting.

Screeching seabirds. Lots of Roman ruins, sheep, old castles, beautiful coastlines, delicious cheeses and more.","textContent":"As we steered our rented hatchback up the narrow gravel road behind the walled city of Óbidos, we had the sinking feeling that Google Maps’ idea of the best route to the popular tourist destination wasn’t the standard way there, and certainly not the most direct.The dusty, tan path was wending past apple, pear and sour cherry orchards, which then transformed into vineyards, then back again to orchards as we climbed. The gap-toothed ramparts loomed in the distance to our right and ahead, a stereotype of a castle that a child would draw: vertical rectangle, horizontal line, vertical rectangle, horizontal line. A dog barked from somewhere down the hillside, and as we reached the walls of the old city, our car wheels started to spin out.“Well, you wanted to get off the beaten path,” my husband said. “You’re here.”We parked the car on the side of the road, observed only by an orange cat, and entered Óbidos literally through the back door. Were we doing something wrong? Would our car get towed? The answer was no, and no. What did happen was we found ourselves at the top of the walled city, near a few raptor handlers sitting with their owls, hawks and falcons under a wooden structure, and remarkably few other tourists. \nThe goal for our very first trip to Portugal was to find smaller cities, mountain villages and activities that wouldn’t mean standing in long lines with other tourists. Our digital navigator led us down ancient Roman roads, footpaths, and narrow cobbled city streets as we explored a more or less scalene triangle-shaped portion of Portugal this fall, traveling from Lisbon to Porto to Monsanto to Evora and back to Lisbon.FAMOUS BRANDY\nChoosing to stay inland before heading to the island of Berlenga led us to Lourinhã, where we stayed in a converted ancient windmill and discovered the region’s famous brandy. As the only visitors to the facility that day, we were treated to a private tour of Adega Cooperativa da Lourinhã, one of only three demarcated brandy regions in Europe, the others being Armagnac and Cognac. The English-language guide and her school-age son gave us a spin around the aging barrels, and the women in the packaging department let us dip bottles of what they call aguardente into red wax to seal them.\nWe next ventured via ferry to the island of Berlenga, about 10 km (6.2 miles) off the fishing village of Peniche. It’s a pink chunk of granite jutting out of the turquoise-to-emerald-green waters of the Atlantic, home to a vast array of seabirds.\nMost visitors come in the morning and leave in the early evening, but we decided to overnight there. The handful of rooms available offer exquisite views of the water, with schools of fish visible even from high above — a dreamy sunset viewing spot.RAUCOUS BIRDSONGAfter swimming in the bracing water at the main beach, where a snorkeler showed an octopus to a group of screeching 20-something Dutch men, we enjoyed a sparkling sangria and Sagres beer, soaking in the views and waiting for our fellow tourists to leave for the day.\nThen, the island was transformed. Only a small group of local fishermen and the occupants of two other rooms at the inn could be found. As we settled into bed, night birds were just revving up. When the proprietor told us we would hear some birdsong in the night, I imagined they would sound like the adorable coqui in Puerto Rico. Instead, it was somewhat like a toddler screaming “Ow, ow, ow, ow, owowowowowowowow!” while standing by our bedside, all night long.Being awake at the crack of dawn after a night of screeching birds had its benefits, though. We spent the morning hiking to the 17th century fort at the opposite side of the island, down a path lined with tiny succulents and bright yellow flowers.HIGHER THAN A RAINBOWAfter a few days back in the tourist crowds in Porto, we took the long way to Monsanto, near the Spanish border, choosing a route through the Parque Nacional da Serra da Estrela. It was our first rainy day on the trip, and winding switchbacks met terrifying wet dirt roads that hovered over sheep down the foggy mountainside. We passed by ski resorts and, during one break in the rain, found ourselves high above a rainbow.\nStopping at the hilltop village of Belmonte, we discovered a 12th century castle, a historic Jewish population and some of the best cheese of our trip. What we thought would be a basic lunch at a nondescript taverna ended up being a great meal at a shop that sold wheels of Serra sheep cheese made by the owner’s cousin, and wine made by the owner himself. It was an afternoon stop that could easily have merited a few days’ exploration.A VILLAGE BUILT AMONG BOULDERSWe arrived in the late afternoon at our Airbnb just below Monsanto, a magical mountaintop village where residents built their abodes in and around massive boulders. The rain paused and we decided to hike the Roman road behind our inn up to the village. The rain didn’t stay away long, however, and the walk back in the near dark was slippery on the ancient stones.\nThe caretaker of the inn suggested we explore the nearby village of Pehna Garcia, where there is a castle, ancient water mills and fossils to discover. Our main objective, though, was the swimming hole nestled beneath the steep rocky hillside. Yet again, Google maps led us to what it deemed a road but was more of a gravel walkway flanked by donkeys under olive trees.A kind man emerged and told us in perfect, British-accented English that we were free to park in front of his red-tiled-roof stone home. The donkeys were happy to see us as we made our way to the natural pool fed by the Ponsul River. We ate a few bites of our picnic lunch before plunging into the cold water and splashing under a waterfall, the only visitors there.VESTIGES OF THE ROMANSLeaving Monsanto for Evora, we made a quick stop in Idanha-a-Velha, one of the oldest towns in Portugal, once prosperous and bustling with a long Roman history but now home to a population of a few dozen. It boasts a ruin of a Knights Templar tower, Roman city gate and walls, and a ghost town vibe.We then descended into the Alentejo region, passing vineyard after vineyard. Cork trees dotted the vast grassland, and cows and sheep took in the shade beneath them. We stopped in Arraiolos, known for its hand-knitted rugs, and nodded at the women sitting and knitting outside their whitewashed homes.In Evora, we opted for the sitting-and-eating type of tourism rather than the walking-around-exploring brand. We did take a journey up to the Temple of Diana and stood in line for the (somewhat creepy) chapel containing the bones of an estimated 5,000 people, including Franciscan monks, that were plucked from cemeteries.But overall, we just enjoyed the vibrant city’s vibes, and had the best meal of the trip at Restaurante Fialho. Under dark, wood-beamed ceilings, we had a lunch of presunto ham, grilled octopus, medallions of the famous local black pork and baked dog fish, served by bow-tie-sporting waiters.Driving in the rain to catch our flight home, we talked about how we felt we had seen much of Portugal, but how in reality it was such a small slice of the country, and a tiny taste of each place we spent time in.“It’s like I was served the most delicious sandwich of my life, and I took one bite and I’m having to just get up and leave the restaurant,” my husband said. We agreed that we’ll have to come back again to finish the meal.—-This story was first published on November 29, 2023.

It’s a love letter to vintage sexploitation films like Russ Meyer’s Motorpsycho and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, Doris Wishman’s Bad Girls Go to Hell, and Robert Aldrich’s Kiss Me Deadly, while also inspired by directors John Waters and Pedro Almodóvar.However, underneath it all lies a girls’ road trip movie which is empowering, enlightening, a little dangerous, and of course, a little fun.The Road MapThe girls' road trip movie (GRTM) is about women who just ~need to get away~ from the monotony of their everyday lives. Abandoning their at-home responsibilities for even a weekend, everything is about being present in the moment with each other, the car, and the road. They meet colorful characters within the Americana melting pot and rebel against the patriarchy through their renewed sense of freedom that comes with connecting to the nature of sisterhood. There might even be car singalongs, a get-rich-quick scheme, and a little bit of crime! (Your mileage may vary.) Compared to other forms of travel, a girls’ road trip movie is a pressure cooker. The car is an unsung and unofficial character and the almost always present race against some clock is the antagonist. Compared to planes, trains, and charter buses, a car is usually the most accessible and convenient (also the slowest) way to travel, especially if you’re a teenager – as we see in many modern versions of this genre. If you have a license, a dream, and the will to drive for hours on end in a metal box while at the mercy of the elements, the world is yours! Trapped in a car together, you become the captain and the crewmembers, you spend every moment together, share lodging and secrets, and are essentially each other’s lifelines out in the expanse of lands with spotty Wi-Fi and sketchy characters.Drive-Away Dolls is a lesbian spin on this genre, yet it drives down the same road as many previous girls’ road trip players have – one that ultimately transforms its travelers. The boisterous Jamie (Qualley) is caught cheating and is kicked out of her shared apartment, so she joins the buttoned-up and touch-starved Marian (Viswanathan) on a trip down to Tallahassee. In the titular drive-away Dodge Aries, they head out with a destination, some unplanned detours, dildos, and multiple dalliances ahead of them. There are a few different dynamics that can come into play in girls' road trip movies: adult best friends (Thelma & Louise, The Sweetest Thing, Joy Ride) or former childhood friends (Unpregnant, Crossroads). Sometimes they’re coworkers or acquaintances (Zola, Death Proof). And while the odd-couple pairing is not required, it’s always more entertaining to have opposing personalities. Women are socialized at a young age to present and act in certain ways that serve the patriarchy and fit within a structure that keeps women in restrictive roles but are at odds with the carefree and curious childlike ways we first experience the world and each other. Remove the constraints of society and we revert to our natures to commune with each other. Consider it the inverse of Lord of the Flies. Women thrive outside of the restrictions of a society constructed by and for men. Take men out of the society that was built for them and they devolve into chaos. Unpregnant (HBO Max)Not-So-United StatesMost GRTMs, however, tend to exaggerate the “othering” feeling of visiting a new place with fundamentally different perspectives or customs. It’s a shorthand for how far they’ve traveled, and as always, it’s never a road trip movie without meeting some colorful characters! Sexy strangers, pervy truck drivers, unfazed diner waitresses, unaccommodating motel clerks, and wary gas station attendants all tinge our travelers’ journey with some interesting color. Ideologically different humans show how the United States is not so united in some of its views, forcing women to contextualize their existence in different parts of the country. Unpregnant had fundamental Christians trying to sabotage the girls' trip to the abortion appointment, while a libertarian prepper suited up and drove them there! Balance?So yes, solo road trips are a thing, but sociologically it’s always better and safer when girls go at it together, like going to the restroom! Move in packs. I’m very serious in claiming Mad Max: Fury Road as a GRTM for the example of the dangers to women on the road, effectively leaving them exposed to their natural predators – men. What’s a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?Often, our heroines end up running away from society and its constructs, roles, and expectations, whichever form that may take. In Thelma & Louise, Thelma’s first act of rebellion is forsaking her shitty husband and running off to a fun girls’ weekend. And while she has a flirty dance with a bar hound, it’s the pervasive rape culture and the realization that the court of public opinion will never take their side that drives Thelma and Louise off a cliff. In Death Proof, Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) gets his kicks off stalking women, taunting them, and running them off the road. He insinuates violence unless he gets the lap dance Julia (Sydney Poitier) promised Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito) would do. The women Stuntman Mike runs into a year later happen to also have stunt women who fight back with a muscle car of their own and kick the shit out of him at the end. In Zola, X (Colman Domingo) is a threatening pimp who uses Stefani (Riley Keough) in an attempt to trap Taylour Paige’s title character into prostitution. Still, the two women form a tenuous partnership to make it through the all-night ordeal. The analogy of restricting and oppressive culture patriarchy is taken to its logical conclusion in Mad Max: Fury Road – women are seen as property and used as breeders and milk harvesters. So for these women, taking to the road is the way to go.Mad Max: Fury Road (Warner Bros. Pictures)The rapidly expanding collection of road trip movies has also lately become a vehicle (pun intended) for stories of strapped young women with unplanned pregnancies (Unpregnant, Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Grandma, Crossroads). Young women on the precipice of adulthood are making a huge personal decision that will change their young lives. In Unpregnant, Veronica (Haley Lu Richardson) is ostensibly trapped by her ignorant, self-serving boyfriend who wants to keep her from going off to college. Taryn Manning’s Mimi in Crossroads is pursuing her pop singer dreams while pregnant and decides that she’s giving her baby conceived from rape up for adoption. On the flip side, however, the road trip encourages a type of sexual freedom; bless these horny tumbleweeds blowing through small towns. Thelma is so satisfied by peak Brad Pitt that she doesn’t realize that he’s robbing them. The women in Joy Ride engage in truly raunchy activities with a basketball team that benched a few of them. Back to Drive-Away Dolls, Jamie and Marian join a basement makeout party. Britney Spears’ entire arc of losing her virginity in Crossroads is iconically captured by “I’m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman”! On the road, these women belong to no one but themselves and it’s so freeing!Thelma & Louise (MGM)To quote Ralph Waldo Emerson, “It’s not the destination, it’s the journey.” Sometimes the destination is only the beginning of the real adventure, where hardships can arise and force these women to scramble. In that process, they learn more about themselves and the world around them while also deepening their friendships. Long live the girls’ road trip movie: the great celebration of the resiliency of being a woman breaking free from a patriarchal society… and a reminder that we can always take a little break now and then to be present with ourselves and our surroundings.

A who’s who of leaders sympathetic to the ANC cause – from Zambia’s Kenneth Kaunda to Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe – greeted the anti-apartheid leader with smiles and handshakes.\nBut the most emotional embrace of all came from a short, stout man with his trademark keffiyeh wrapped around his head: Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization. Pulling the 6-foot-4-inch tall Mandela’s face down towards him, Arafat placed kisses on Mandela’s cheeks.\nMandela would reciprocate that show of support in his own way three months later, when he attended a summit in Algiers wearing the Palestinian keffiyeh. While it is unclear where he got it or why he chose to wear it that day, it could not have been an accident – Mandela was notoriously deliberate about how he dressed.\nMandela’s ghostwriter Richard Stengel observed: “Mandela was always aware of his own image. His sense of this was curiously modern, far ahead of what his colleagues and enemies understood at the time.”\nIn 1962, after being charged with leaving the country illegally, Mandela – known for his smart suits and shiny shoes – arrived in court in a jackal-skin kaross, a beaded necklace and a shoulder bracelet. His new wife Winnie, also clad in traditional Xhosa attire, cheered him on from the public gallery. He knew exactly what he was doing. As Mandela wrote: “It was to assert myself. To go to the white man’s court as an African, wearing my own outfit and not the one that is desired by court.”\nIn 1995, a year after becoming the first democratically elected president of South Africa, Mandela famously wore the Springbok rugby jersey – for many, a symbol of apartheid – to present Francois Pienaar with the Rugby World Cup trophy. This time, his goal was to mend the divisions in his fractured nation.\nSouth African anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela meets PLO leader Yasser Arafat, right, May 20, 1990, in Cairo, Egypt [Axel Schulz-Eppers/AP Photo]\nMandela felt a special bond with the Palestinian people. In 1997, while still president of South Africa, he said the ANC’s struggle was ongoing. “We know too well that our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians.”\nIn 2004, after the death of Arafat, he paid tribute to the leader of the PLO: “He was an icon in the proper sense of the word. He was not only concerned with the liberation of the Arab people but of all the oppressed people throughout the world – Arabs and non-Arabs – and to lose a man of that stature and thinking is a great blow to all those who are fighting against oppression.”\nThree years after Mandela’s death on December 5, 2013, the people of Palestine repaid the favour by unveiling a giant statue of the South African leader in the occupied West Bank city of Ramallah.\nThat sentiment of warmth – and the iconic imagery of Mandela and the keffiyeh – returned to underscore the nature of South Africa’s relationship with the Palestinian struggle after the October 7 Hamas attack on southern Israel.\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa condemned that attack, but as Israeli bombs began killing thousands of innocent people in Gaza, he stepped in front of cameras, wearing a black and white keffiyeh around his neck, and holding a small Palestinian flag in his hand.\n“They [the Palestinian people] have been under occupation for almost 75 years … waging a struggle against an oppressive government that has occupied their land, but also a government that has in recent times been dubbed an apartheid state,” he said.\nA sculpture of Nelson Mandela is seen after being erected during a ceremony attended by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and other Palestinian ministers in Ramallah, West Bank on April 26, 2016 [Issam Rimawi/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images]\nThere is no evidence, says historian Thula Simpson, that Mandela identified himself with the Palestinian cause before his imprisonment in 1963. In fact, when he established Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), the ANC’s military wing, many of his key inspirations were Israeli.\nArthur Goldreich was one of the few in the ANC who had any battlefield experience. As Mandela writes in his autobiography: “In the 1940s, Arthur had fought with the Palmach, the military wing of the Jewish National Movement in Palestine. He was knowledgeable about guerrilla warfare and helped fill in many gaps in my understanding.” Goldreich went on to become a prominent critic of “the ‘abhorrent’ racism in Israeli society”.\nIn his recent book, Spear: Mandela and the Revolutionaries, Paul S Landau observes that while setting up MK, Mandela read Menachem Begin’s The Revolt: Story of the Irgun, about another Zionist paramilitary force in Palestine. The Irgun, wrote Landau, was even more radical than the Palmach and issued in 1944 “a public call to revolt”. Mandela’s handwritten notes show that he was impressed by their tactics. “The Irgun provided Mandela with an anti-state (anti-British) guerrilla model, and in its penumbra he first recorded the concept of a ‘prolonged struggle’ in connection with a coming guerrilla war,” wrote Landau.\nSimpson said, during his 27-year imprisonment, Mandela would have been aware of the support the ANC received from other countries, of Afro-Asian solidarity and the broad strokes of the PLO’s struggle. But detailed knowledge of the South African situation would have been difficult enough to obtain, let alone what was happening in Palestine.\nFrom left, Nelson Mandela, his wife, Winnie, US President George HW Bush and First Lady Barbara at the White House, Washington, DC, in June 1990 [Bettman via Getty Images]\nAfter his release in February 1990, however, he wasted no time in getting up to speed on the ANC’s international relations and expressing his foreign policy views. In June of that year, four years before he became president of South Africa, Mandela was invited to the US by President George HW Bush. At a town hall meeting chaired by ABC News’s Ted Koppel, Mandela was challenged about the public support he had given to leaders like Fidel Castro, Muammar Gaddafi and Arafat, who faced accusations of human rights violations.\nWithout skipping a beat, Mandela responded: “One of the mistakes which some political analysts make is to think that their enemies should be our enemies.”\nThe crowd erupted in applause, before finally allowing Mandela to continue: “That we can, and we will never do. We have our own struggle, which we are conducting. We are grateful to the world for supporting our struggle, but nevertheless, we are an independent organisation with its own policy … Our attitude towards any country is determined by the attitude of that country to our struggle. Yasser Arafat, Colonel Gaddafi, Fidel Castro support our struggle to the hilt … Our attitude is based solely on the fact that they fully support the anti-apartheid struggle. They do not support it only in rhetoric. They are placing resources at our disposal, for us to win the struggle.”\nResponding, Henry Siegman of the American Jewish Congress expressed “profound disappointment” with Mandela’s answer “because it suggests a certain degree of amorality, that … what these people do in their own countries … is totally irrelevant … as long as they support the cause of the ANC”.\nMandela doubled down, explaining that as a liberation movement involved in its own struggle, the ANC had “no time to be looking into the internal affairs of other countries”. As far as Arafat and the PLO were concerned, Mandela explained that “we identify with the PLO because, just like ourselves, they are fighting for the right of self-determination”.\nHe added: “The support for Yasser Arafat in his struggle does not mean that the ANC has ever doubted the right of Israel to exist as a state, legally. We have stood quite openly and firmly for the right of that state to exist within secure borders. But, of course … We carefully define what we mean by secure borders. We do not mean that Israel has the right to retain the territories they conquered from the Arab world, like the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights and the West Bank. We don’t agree with that. Those territories should be returned to the Arab people.”\nPLO leader Arafat and Cuba’s Fidel Castro attend the inauguration ceremony for South African President Mandela in 1994 [Turnley/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images]\nHistorian Matthew Graham says South Africa’s foreign policy is a product of the ANC’s history. “The ANC’s support networks in exile crossed the Cold War divide,” he explained. “The party was very good at talking to anybody and everybody. They had an office in London but were also talking to Gaddafi and Castro and the like.”\nBut, Graham stressed, “Their real support came from the Eastern bloc. This meant it developed really close relations at the very top of the ANC, which persisted well into the post-apartheid era.” Mandela’s inauguration in 1994, for instance, saw Arafat and Castro sitting a discreet distance away from US Vice President Al Gore and First Lady Hilary Clinton at a time when Washington treated the PLO and Cuba’s communist government as pariahs.\nDespite having now been in power for almost 30 years, the ANC still sees itself as a liberation movement whose project is incomplete, Graham said. “They continue to walk a tightrope. They need Western economic help to fix South Africa, yet they talk and project like a radical liberation movement.” This, he is convinced, stems from their history of “talking to all sides”.\nSimpson agreed. “The ANC tailored its foreign policy after 1990 on the basis of its experience in the liberation struggle. They view themselves as pushing for a new international order, and the Palestinian struggle as an extension of the ANC struggle.” There is, he adds, “no strictly economic rationale in supporting Cuba, or Palestine … or Russia. It’s more of an affinity, part of a worldview that looks on these as being separate fronts in a shared global struggle.”\nThere is a cruel irony that the ANC’s coming to power coincided with the fall of the Berlin Wall – what Francis Fukuyama famously referred to as “the end of history”. Simpson believed that Mandela and his comrades “felt hemmed in by a new order, which was hostile to the kinds of changes that they wished to engineer within South Africa”. “The ANC was scared of the Washington Consensus and becoming overly reliant on the IMF and Washington.”\nFormer South African President Mandela shakes hands with a young Palestinian girl during a tour of Jerusalem’s old city in October 1999 [Daoud Mizrahi/AFP]\nSimpson argued that both Bush presidents offered South Africa a deal to act as a “point man” in Southern Africa – but the ANC was reluctant to take it.\nHe believed the reasons for their refusals were more about domestic affairs than foreign policy. “Under apartheid, state power had been used to create inequality. The struggle was one for power, to overcome inherited, largely socio-economic backlogs.”\nAnd while the ANC assumed political power in 1994, large sections of the economy remained – as some still remain – under white control. “It’s all about the externalisation of an internal struggle,” said Simpson. “Pushing back against a global economic order, buttressed by US military power, and the internal extension of that order, which manifests itself as racialised inequality.”\nFrom the outside, South Africa’s foreign policy can seem incoherent. From a moral standpoint, it is hard to square the government’s abstention from the United Nations vote condemning Russia’s annexation of Ukrainian territories with their impassioned support for the Palestinian cause.\nBut this, Graham said, misses the point. As he wrote in his book, The Crisis of South African Foreign Policy: “There is still a belief that the ANC remains the champion of democracy and human rights ideals, which it itself had so vociferously proclaimed. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth, because when issues of democracy and human rights are pitted against the anti-imperial agenda, the ANC’s anti-imperialism triumphs every time. This only serves to fuel perceptions of incoherence and contradiction.”\nMandela is embraced by Arafat as he arrives at Lusaka airport, February 27, 1990 [Howard Burditt/Reuters]\nThe ANC’s affinity with Palestine is also not surprising given the close ties between Israel and the apartheid government. In the 1930s, the National Party membership card featured the Swastika, and during World War II, BJ Vorster, who went on to serve as South Africa’s prime minister from 1966 to 1978, was jailed for his involvement in the paramilitary wing of the anti-British, pro-Nazi Ossewabrandwag.\nIn the early days, wrote Sasha Polakow-Suransky, “Israeli leaders’ ideological hostility toward apartheid kept the two nations apart.” In 1963, Golda Meir told the UN General Assembly that Israelis “naturally oppose policies of apartheid, colonialism and racial or religious discrimination wherever they exist”.\nBut things began to change after the 1967 war, which saw Israel seize territory from its Arab neighbours, tripling its size in just six days. “The settlement project that soon followed planted hundreds of thousands of Jews on hilltops and in urban centers throughout the newly conquered West Bank and Gaza Strip, saddling Israel with the stigma of occupation and forever tarring it with the colonialist brush,” wrote Polakow-Suransky.\nThe 1973 Yom Kippur War may have been started by a coalition of Arab states led by Egypt and Syria, but for the global left, Israel’s fightback and subsequent territorial gains confirmed their status as an oppressor. Egypt also reclaimed some territory.  After the Yom Kippur War, wrote Polakow-Suransky, “all but a few African countries severed diplomatic ties with the Jewish state … It wasn’t long before Israel initiated defence cooperation with some of the world’s most notoriously brutal regimes, including Argentina’s military dictatorship, Pinochet’s Chile and apartheid South Africa.”\nIn 1993, Mandela said the ANC had been “extremely unhappy” with Israel’s collaboration with the apartheid government. The ANC’s senior leadership has not forgotten that many of the weapons the apartheid government used to kill their people were bought from Israel. It has since emerged that Israel even went so far as to offer nuclear warheads to the apartheid regime.\nPalestinians gather at a candle memorial for Mandela in an area of Jerusalem’s Old City popular with Africans, on December 7, 2013, two days after the Nobel Peace Prize winner’s death [NurPhoto/Corbis via Getty Images]\nLike most anticolonial movements, the anti-apartheid struggle grappled with questions of if and when it was appropriate to respond to a brutal state apparatus with violence.\nYet, the ANC itself was founded on principles of non-violence. As the apartheid government ratcheted up its attacks on civilians in the 1950s the organisation maintained its belief in the power of peaceful protest.\nIt was only in 1961, after being pushed over the edge by the massacre of at least 69 innocent Black people at Sharpeville, that Mandela himself asked the ANC to abandon its policy of non-violence. It took a lot of convincing but eventually the party leadership agreed to the formation of MK.\nOn December 16, 1961, handbills were scattered in the townships of Port Elizabeth and pasted on lamp posts in Johannesburg: “The people’s patience is not endless. The time comes in the life of any nation where there remain only two choices: submit or fight. That time has now come to South Africa. We shall not submit and we have no choice but to hit back by all means within our power in defence of our people, our future and our freedom.”\nThat context is vital to understanding comments made by Mandela during a state visit to Palestine in 1999: “Choose peace rather than confrontation. Except in cases where we cannot get, where we cannot proceed, or we cannot move forward. Then if the only alternative is violence, we will use violence.”\nThat alternative of violence was one that Mandela used sparingly. Under Mandela, MK only carried out sabotage strikes on state infrastructure and military installations, going to great lengths to prevent civilian loss of life.\nA decade after his passing, Israel’s bombardment of Gaza is killing thousands of civilians. The death toll is close to 16,000 Palestinians, including more than 6,000 children. To Mandela, it would surely have felt personal. As he said during his 1999 visit to Gaza, he felt “at home among compatriots”.\nMandela’s is one of the 12 remarkable lives covered in Dall’s recent book Legends: People Who Changed South Africa for the Better, co-written with Matthew Blackman.","length":16984,"publishedTime":"2023-12-05T13:38:10Z","rating":[8,9,7,8,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about Nelson Mandela's historical actions, interactions with international leaders like Yasser Arafat, and his symbolic clothing choices.

Get excited folks, because WWE announced two whole matches and an appearance for the show. That’s like inviting me to a full-menu dinner and only telling me two appetizers ahead of time. How do I know if I’m even gonna like it, if I can barely smell what you’re cooking? It’s time for the most OVERRATED and UNDER-APPRECIATED moments from this week’s Friday Night Smackdown.\nWhy do we assume everyone knows what P.L.E. means? They say it constantly, but I can’t remember them actually saying it stands for Premium Live Event. This feels like they just tried to sneak it in there as already-canon slang. P.L.E…which in this case, stands for Please Let’s Explain.\nTonight’s Smackdown is brought to us by Progressive, because that’s what WWE wants you to know they are. Jokes aside, where’s Flo? Why aren’t we doing something hysterical with her? This P.L.E. is brought to you by Progressive, so welcome to WWE FLO MERCY. In our main event, it’s Flo versus Jake from State Farm versus the Geico gecko in a triple threat, like Progressive, which is a triple threat of home, auto and more! I kid, but I honestly think it’s only a matter of time before we get Flo in a WWE cameo.\nNot having The Rock come out under The Bloodline banner just makes Roman Reigns look weak. He’s still jamming out with his second fiddle to Rocky’s air guitar. Seriously though, you tell us he’s in The Bloodline, but he can’t walk out to their music? The Rock doesn’t need a solo (not that one). He needs to be boosting Reigns as the head of the table, heading into the main event of WrestleMania. This is like being at a diner and having someone bring you hot chocolate, and then the whipped cream several minutes later. By that time, the hot chocolate has completely cooled off, and guess where the whipped cream goes…on top. Feeling like a different kind of cool, Roman? Grab one of those Levels Above hoodies because it’s going to be a chilly ride when you’re blocked from the sun, hiding in Rock’s shadow. Wow. That was a tangent and a half, even for me. Cody Rhodes, lord help you if you ever ask what I want to talk about.\nWait, has Roman Reigns’ augmented reality graphic always spewed some kind of blue mist? Is virtual Roman vaping? For shame, WWE, for shame! I don’t care where you sit at the table, that poison air is wafting around the whole room. Virtual Reigns is levels above…when it comes to lung deterioration…irritability…and all the other side effects written in really small font.\nMy absolute favorite moment of Roman Reigns’ entrance, is when he’s hoisting his prize above his head, with fireworks going off, and his lackeys throwing a finger up, and he suddenly gets self conscious and pulls his shirt down because one of his abs is hanging out. Roman, since when are you self-conscious? Did you treat yourself to one of The Rock’s insane cheat meals? You’ll be okay. Be proud of who you are. It’s what’s on the inside that counts, and inside all of that muscle, bravado and tattoos is…actually, let’s stick with shallow judgment.\nHas anyone else noticed that Roman Reigns’ entrance song sounds like a slowed down, movie trailer version of Justin Timberlake’s Cry Me A River? The tribal chief acknowledges you, Justin. If you don’t acknowledge him back, it could be Bye Bye Bye for you.\nKudos to WWE for having enough confidence in The Bloodline’s heat to allow a significant amount of time for them to get drowned in boos. That could have backfired, but they gambled and it paid off. Good job acknowledging your heat, my tribal chief. Soak it in. You’ve earned it…sort of. Well, truthfully you were handed the top spot on a silver platter, but you’ve earned it post-nepotism. Believe that.\nI absolutely love this concept of Roman Reigns repeating his acknowledgment schtick to get the response he wants. He had the crowd wrapped around his finger tighter than a corset in Pirates of the Caribbean. If I had one nitpick, it would be him getting angry. He should be playing it cool. He can’t let the crowd get under his skin. It pokes holes in the armor of his aura. Saying his obligations are finished and he’s leaving…on a jet…is perfect heel fodder. This is what I was saying a few weeks ago about Cody Rhodes and his luxury bus. Rich people stuff is for heels. Let Roman ride his jet, and you just enter the arena. We don’t need to see your rich-mobile.\nThere is literally a sign in the crowd that states Jimmy Uso is someone’s hero. Honestly, anonymous fan, that’s just trying too hard. That’s like looking up the ref’s names before a live event, so you can yell to them and get the smallest rub of acknowledgement (see what I did there?), from the lowest rung on the ladder. Sorry, Jimmy. You’re not the ones, or even the one, you’re a solid four…five with The Rock…with or without yeet.\nPaul Heyman is like a gloriously evil version of Mick Foley, always figuring out ways to get cheap heat. Hyping The Rock, and then throwing to a commercial break is hilariously annoying, and such a heel move. I would love to see Paul whip this schtick out more.\nDuring Paul Heyman’s hype for The Rock, Roman Reigns seems absolutely furious, like someone just peed in the pool at his pool party. He looks jealous, petty, and just spiteful, which he should be, but not toward The Rock, fresh off of their alliance. It’s too soon to show the cracks. I’m starting to feel like they’re telegraphing The Rock turning on Reigns, in a double cross, that he whispered in Cody Rhodes’ ear last month.\nI’m always so pleasantly surprised at the creativity of WWE fans. I was completely yanked out of the aura of The Rock’s entrance when I saw a sign saying that he eats corn the long way. What?! Corn is delicious, and eating it the long way seems like a waste of savoring its sweet little boxes of flavor, and a potential choking hazard. Rock may put a boot up your ass, but he certainly doesn’t want you choking…right? Right?!\nWhat is this shirt The Rock is wearing? It literally looks like some designer just thought of the most expensive collage of random things, and put them on a shirt and called it fashion. Rock, you look like you’re auditioning to play The Goblet of Fire in Harry Potter. Also, is this made out of a tarp? I feel like I could use this to cover my air conditioner in the winter. But what do I know? It doesn’t matter what I think.\nI get that The Rock is always going to walk that fine line of being too edgy, but shouting out cocaine and meth, and then cutting to a crowd cheering is a little classless. I feel like The Rock is just flailing a little bit, not sure if he can hang onto this heel heat. Also, honorable mention to something The Rock finds overrated…buttons and using them. He took it even further by saying they finally have something worth shooting into their veins because he’s there. Again, Rock…way too far. People die every day from that. I’d say that probably knocked off a solid $12.5 million off of the box office profit for Moana 2. Side note, is anyone else’s broadcast of Smackdown cutting in and out? I feel like the Fox signal is on meth.\nI loved The Rock pointing out that we can’t tell, but that’s Solo Sikoa’s happy face. This could be a fun gimmick for him, always acting grumpy but insisting he’s happy. It’s kind of like Tommy Lee Jones’ monotone and emotionless character in Men in Black. He made that work with bland charm. I could see Solo doing something similar, just without the suit, sunglasses and hit single. Remember that song? YouTube it. You’re welcome, and apologies for sticking that in your head with superglue for the next 3 years.\nProps to Solo Sikoa for giving a dumbfounded, fear-stricken face when The Rock suggested he might sing the national anthem. His resting Solo face is hilarious, especially when he has someone to riff off of. The crowd then erupts into a chant for the would-be singer. And just like that, Solo got over without saying a word. That’s what a master The Rock is. God it’s good to have him back, especially when he manipulates the crowd into great reactions.\nI didn’t see the reveal of stipulation stakes and a double main event for Roman Reigns coming. It makes sense. If you’re going to have Roman work 2 nights back-to-back, you might as well give him an excuse to keep his bumps to a minimum. I love the stakes of this. Getting rid of The Bloodline almost ensures a Cody Rhodes victory. This is incredibly smart booking, and it has me very excited for both WrestleMania nights and the amped up arc between them. Well done, WWE. Very smart. Kudos. I’ll give you some corn on the cob to eat however you like.\nUgh. Did The Rock have to go the angle of saying he’s on the board and essentially the new evil boss character? You’re better than that, Rock. We don’t need you singing passé oldies. We want some new jams from you and your yukalaylee. Special props to spell check for teaching me how to spell yukalaylee, which I don’t think I’ve ever typed in my life, until this moment. The Rock…providing boots to asses and literacy to the masses.\nOh my God. Roman Reigns physically stopping The Rock from doing his most famous line, is the most badass, authority-cementing, alpha-asserting move I’ve seen since this alliance started. Then he tops it off by asking The Rock to acknowledge him. That’s an “I’ll be back”, “You had me at hello”, “Take your hands off me you damn dirty ape” level of moment. I’m going to need therapy after tonight. How can I be expected to sleep after witnessing the energy in this moment, equivalent to drinking 5 Zoa Energy Drinks?! Now we know why Roman was snarling and over-selling his annoyance during The Rock’s entrance. It was annoying me to no end, but now that I see what he was holding inside, and he totally redeemed himself (he says in his best Dumb & Dumber voice).\nThe Rock just removed his sunglasses and I’m fairly confident he’s wearing blush makeup on his cheeks. Nothing wrong with that mind you, to each their own, it’s just jarring to see Black Adam with rosy cheeks. Maybe he’s feeling particularly festive, like this match is an early Christmas gift. Yeah. Let’s go with that. Merry Christmas, Rock.\nAnd the Oscar goes to…drumroll…Paul Heyman for best supporting actor in a drama. His facial expressions and eyes were absolutely gold during this segment between Roman Reigns and The Rock. He’s just the human embodiment of punctuation in anything he does. In this exchange, he took the form of an exclamation point, just ending it all on a high note. Bravo, Paul. Bravo. Honorable mention to The Rock for putting over Reigns by acknowledging him. Reigns needed this. He was drowning in The Rock’s shadow. Kudos to Rock for seeing what was happening and course correcting…you know…again.\nI don’t think Roman Reigns needed to act like a kid that just got an N64 on Christmas in the ‘90s, when The Rock handed him the mic. Instead of having the Rock initiate it and then pass the torch, so to speak, I think Roman, staring straight ahead, should have just stretched his hand out, and have Rock obey. Similar to what he does with Paul Heyman when he’s talking. It’s such a powerful alpha move and I would have loved to see him do that to The Rock.. That would have been the stronger play in my humble opinion.\nThe funeral for Austin Theory’s push continues in this segment with Grayson Waller and Randy Orton. I can’t believe how much this guy has cooled off from where he was. He’s starting to feel like the wedding cake you keep in your freezer for your one year anniversary. Only by the time you go to eat it, it’s lost all of its flavor. A-Town going down aside, I thought Randy was hilarious in this segment. This reminds me of when Kurt Angle went full Kurt Angle, and dove headfirst into being funny. I like this side of Randy. He mixes violent intent with humorous quips like they’re soulmates. You gave me 3 letters in that segment, Randy…L…O…L. See what I did there? It’s fun to play with words. Ya know what else is fun to play? WWE2K24 releasing next week. Pre-order your Brock Lesnar-free edition today!\nWait, so Randy Orton gets a main event because he got offended by people talking about him? This loose storytelling bothers me. This makes it sound like Nick Aldis didn’t plan for a main event. What if Randy hadn’t taken offense to Austin Theory and Grayson Waller? What then? This booking is looser than a belt at Weight Watchers.\nOh yay, WWE is promoting Nascar again. Nothing says sports entertainment like onesies covered in ads, cars that look like they’re covered in stickers, and a whole lot of left turns. If they’re going to do this, they might as well go full bore and get a WWE car made, and have a superstar drive it, so we at least get a little action.\nI’d like to thank WWE for sparing us a lengthy Naomi dance entrance, and a pose-a-thon from Tiffany Stratton. Nothing against them. They’re hard workers, but both of their entrances could use a revamp. Naomi’s entrance in particular feels like a rerun I’ve seen a hundred times, and she just came back, which tells you her entrance is more tired than Firestone. Special mention to Wade Barrett for reminding us that Tiffy time eliminated Naomi at The Elimination Chamber. I like this dynamic of having previous conflicts dictate future matches. It’s smart and rewards us for watching.\nTiffany Stratton and Naomi having a flip off (flipping each other off?) mid-match is ridiculous. On one hand, it’s impressive athleticism that fans will eat up. On the other hand, it makes it seem like they truly don’t have any aggression toward each other. Also, Corey Graves mentioned Naomi is a former women’s champion. I don’t remember this at all. I think they need to keep both women’s world titles on their respective champs for a long time, to build back up the novelty of seeing a title change. They’ve done a great job with Rhea Ripley, but I honestly had to stop and think about who the other champ was.\nI keep forgetting that Tiffany Stratton was an Olympic gymnast. Thank you, Corey Graves for reminding us. That’s real clout that helps her credibility. WWE should put together a hype package for her, much like they did with Kurt Angle when he first came in. Otherwise, it’s easy to miss if you’re not listening closely to Graves.\nHold the phones. Bailey and Dakota Kai get a tag title shot because Damage Control hurt Kai’s leg? Well if that doesn’t encourage inter-work assault, or faking injury, I don’t know what will. If this logic was sound, Tonya Harding wouldn’t have been stripped of her Olympic gold medal.\nKairi Sane has really come into her own with her mannerisms. She is straight up creepy, and has a soulless stare she does at the camera that gives me goosebumps…and I don’t mean the books. She legitimately looks at the camera with the same blank, haunting glare as the ghost girl in The Grudge. It works in spades. Thanks Kairi, now I’m not going to sleep tonight, because your twisty umbrella and ghost stare are going to give me nightmares. Excuse me while I hide under my bed…because that ALWAYS works in horror movies. Right?\nWhy is Iyo Sky walking around like she just lived through a traumatic event, and she’s still plagued with P.T.S.D.? Did Kairi Sane give her nightmares too? She looks like a puppy during a thunderstorm every week. I feel like if anyone makes the slightest sound, she’s going to jump 10-feet. Personally. I wish it was Kairi versus Bayley at WrestleMania. At least Kairi is along for the buildup. Here’s hoping Sky overcomes whatever has her looking like a deer in headlights. Maybe it’s just stage fright. If so, at least she picked a good business to avoid such things.\nI really enjoy the piranha-esq antics of The Kabuki Warriors, swimming around the ring, taking little bites anywhere they can. Special mention to the predictable turn of Dakota Kai being done unpredictably mid-hot tag. That was jarringly fast, in a good way. Well done! If I had a sticker book of gold stars, I’d give you two, Dakota.\nI love that they’re feeding more credible wrestlers to Bron Breakker. It’s so much better than no-names getting annihilated, and despite losing, it gives the NXT stars some exposure to the mainstream audience. It’s win win. Also, I don’t think I’ll need another cup of coffee for a week after that match. Bron’s matches are like an espresso shot, mixed with Red Bull, and chased with a Zoa. I still ccan’t gett overr the inexplicable use of two k’s in his namme, but so bbe itt. I’m sure as hell not going to say anything to him.\nThat Santos Escobar versus Carlito package has me hyped for a match I wasn’t even looking forward to. Escobar is a fantastic villain, and such a natural actor. His minions, not so much, but that’s okay. He’s enough of a mouthpiece for everyone involved. I could see him working his way up to being a top heel in the future. I also love The Emperor of Lucha Libre moniker. It’s catchy and sounds powerful.\nOur ring announcer just rattled off all of the names of the L.W.O. accompanying Carlito to the ring. The only problem? They stopped at the entrance ramp. I don’t know if they got distracted by the sea of great fan signs, weren’t paying attention to the announcer, or simply got stage fright, but it’s jarring to announce a team doing something that they’re not actually doing. And now, I’ll relax in my Ferrari, on my private island, while I continue breaking down inconsequential details of Smackdown.\nCall me crazy, and I know it’s not sanitary in this day and age, but I miss the nostalgic “I spit in the face of people who don’t want to be cool” entrance quote. That said, I want to give props to Corey Graves for pointing out that Carlito grew up on the island that made hardcore famous. I’ve been wondering why this is a street fight. That’s great context. Man, WWE is on fire lately with making things make sense, even little nuances like this. They’re feeding us warm donuts every week, and remembering all the sprinkles.\nI get that this is a street fight between Santos Escobar and Carlito, and I love ring weapons as much as the next guy, but chair shots to the head have no place in wrestling today. No thank you. Slap on the wrist, WWE, maybe even a ruler to the knuckles. That’s right, I’m combating violence with violence because two wrongs…cancel each other out.\nThis is going to sound hypocritical, but I truly don’t mind the shots to the top of the trashcan by Carlito, with Santos Escobar’s evil head inside. He feels protected, and it looks like a Looney Tunes character pounding someone into the ground. That’s what’s up, doc.\nSantos Escobar versus Carlito was a perfectly fine match while it lasted. Did we really need the guys who look like angry shirtless doctors, with their white pants, interfering? Santos could benefit from a clean win, but the heat does do him well too. Carlito feels like he’s lost a step in the ring. He’s still over, and has the charisma, but his fluidity between moves seems to have gotten more clogged than an artery in a potato chip factory.\nWait, that wasn’t the end of the Santos Escobar versus Carlito match? I didn’t see that coming. I also didn’t see Rey Mysterio returning. I was bummed to see him on crutches, and popped big when it was a swerve. He may be older, but you can’t teach that kind of fire that burns in Rey. He is beloved for a reason. I’m stoked for the likely showdown between Rey and Escobar at WrestleMania. I feel like I was eating a hot fudge sundae, and you just pulled out a brownie that makes it all even more delicious.\nI’m not a huge fan of Rey Mysterio’s mask tonight. He looks like he’s cosplaying the love child of Magneto and an orc from The Lord of the Rings.\nGo back and watch the interaction between Nick Aldis and L.A. Knight again. Keep an eye on his sunglasses. He removes them, and then struggles to fold them for most of the segment. It’s okay to use two hands, Knight.\nHearing Kevin Owens announced as a “special commentator”, and then having him happily react to the intro, was hilarious. Is there anyone better than Owens with off-the-cuff quips right now? He has a bright future as a commentator when he retires. Special mention of Owens pointing out that Austin Theory is dumb because he doesn’t bundle all of his insurance with (Smackdown sponsor) Progressive. Hilarious.\nIf Randy Orton continues to take this long during his entrance, I’d like to propose we change his moniker from viper to snail. Pick up the pace, Randy. We don’t have all day. Grayson Waller has Hawaiian shirts to buy, and Austin Theory is out of baby oil.\nI love it when Randy Orton whips out a creative variation on the R.K.O. I still haven’t forgotten when he nailed Evan Bourne with it, mid shooting star press. When he gets creative with these, it’s just beautiful. Kevin Owens also deserves a commission on this money-maker for his over-the-top laugh after it happened.\nI’ll be back Monday to completely distract you from Raw’s narrative!\n(This is the debut column from Kevin Duncan, a/k/a Kevin Thats Weird.

We have removed many dangling cables, and we will shortly carry out another drive a","textContent":"After many complaints, work of removing dangling wires begins in MahadevapuraThere have been a number of incidents where dangling wires pose a threat to commuters and pedestrians while also spoiling the appealing look of the city. Several resident welfare associations and citizen groups from Mahadevapura highlighted the much-needed drive for the removal of dangling OFC cables in a meeting with the Joint Commissioner of Mahadevapura, Dr Dakshayini K. After that, the officials have been carrying out the removal drives and have covered some of the areas in the constituency.On July 12–21, the first drive was carried out, and the dangling cables were removed in places such as Whitefield, Marathahalli, and Hoodi. Many of the cables hanging from the transformers, electric poles, or even trees were removed with the precautions taken by the authorities.The drive was again continued between the first two weeks of August, and areas like Doddanekundi, Bellandur, KR Puram, and Marathahalli flyover were covered.“Many RWA members and citizen groups highlighted the need for the removal of OFC as it was posing safety hazards. To prevent unwanted accidents, we started with the drive, as many people who are walking can come into contact with the wire, which could be extremely dangerous. Even those riding bikes and children playing can come into contact, and there could also be chances of strangulation. We have observed that many areas across the constituency have this issue and are carrying out the drive for the safety of citizens,” said Dr Dakshayini. While she also pointed out that as the constituency is bigger, the process would take time and be completely free of dangling wires, and that the removal had been carried out with the engineers and health inspectors in place.“The process is ongoing and will take some time. Even after removing it, there are even chances that some of the providers will come and put it up again. This again lengthens the process for the officers. Illegal OFC cables are not allowed, and permission needs to be obtained from the BBMP to install the cables. All the cables should go underground,” added Dr Dakshayini. A few days ago, the Whitefield Rising group filed a complaint with the DCP of Whitefield against an illegally laid OFC. However, so far, no complaint has been registered..A BBMP official from the Mahadevapura zone said, “The drive was initiated based on the Whitefield Rising complaint. We have removed many dangling cables, and we will shortly carry out another drive as well. There needs to be strict vigilance for the illegal cables not to come back. We don’t have sufficient engineers to keep track of it. We will also start filing complaints about the illegal cables installed at the police station.”A recent incident was reported on Kariyammana Agrahara main road where a 23-year-old was trapped under the electric pole due to the dangling cable from the pole getting stuck in the truck, dragging the pole down, and the pole falling on the 23-year-old boy. It has resulted in many citizens asking the BBMP to remove all the dangling cables and file complaints against those installing the illegal cables. To prevent unwanted accidents, we started with the drive, as many people who are walking can come into contact with the wire, which could be extremely dangerousDr Dakshayini K“Given the recent spate of accidents involving illegal overhanging cables, it is high time the government takes actions. Thankfully, the JC of Mahadevapura initiated the campaign in July. It has been carried out in fits and starts. There was a lot of interference from politicians preventing the BBMP carrying out the drive,” said Sandeep Anirudhan, Convenor, Namma Whitefield.","length":3725,"publishedTime":"2023-08-24T06:00:00+05:30","rating":[9,8,7,6,8,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the removal of dangling wires in Bengaluru, specifically in Mahadevapura.

The aircraft, a Boeing 777-200, was quickly diverted to Los Angeles after the tire was lost. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the incident, it said on Thursday.The incident comes after a Boeing 757 plane in January lost a nose wheel while taxiing in Atlanta, which also prompted an FAA probe.The flight landed safely in Los Angeles around 1:30 p.m., and the airline was arranging a new aircraft for passengers to continue their trip to Japan, the United Airlines spokesperson said. Boeing deferred comment to United Airlines.The 777-200, which can carry 249 people, has six tires on each of its two main landing gear struts and is designed to land safely with missing or damaged tires, according to United Airlines.A live stream of planes departing from San Francisco International Airport on Thursday appeared to capture the moment the United flight lost a tire. The video shows a United plane take off and then, seconds later, a tire comes loose from the aircraft’s left landing gear strut and falls to the ground.Debris from the tire landed in an employee parking lot at San Francisco International Airport, damaging several vehicles, said Doug Yakel, a spokesperson for the airport. No one was injured, and the runway was briefly closed so the debris could be cleared. Footage from local news outlets showed cars and metal fencing dented after the incident.Boeing faced heavy scrutiny from regulators after a door plug blew out of a Boeing 737 Max 9 plane midflight in January, which led the FAA to ground more than 170 jets. Investigations subsequently found loose bolts on some Boeing planes and misdrilled holes on Boeing fuselages in production.Lori Aratani contributed to this report.","length":2083,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T23:39:14.871Z","rating":[6,8,7,5,7,6,5],"reason":"The article provides factual information about the incident involving a United flight losing a wheel during takeoff.

The shots didn't fall, the defense could not slow the Michigan Wolverines enough.\n \"They made life difficult for us,\" Gophers coach Dawn Plitzuweit said.\n On the second day of the Big Ten Conference tournament, the 11th-seeded Gophers' run quickly ended with a 76-57 loss to the sixth-seeded Wolverines (19-12), whose defense slowed the Gophers attack, whose physical play made the entire night a grind.\n \"On offense, any shot you got you had to work for,\" said guard Amaya Battle, who finished the two-game tournament run playing on a new, higher level. \"And even then it wasn't easy. And they were crashing the boards. They're super physical.\"\n And it was from the start. The Gophers missed eight of their first 10 shots. They were behind by double figures before the game was six minutes old, down 23-12 after one quarter, 37-24 at halftime and 58-41 entering the fourth.\n That they continued to work is a credit to the way the Gophers played all year. That they struggled so mightily to score again emphasized the challenges that come from playing without leading scorer Mara Braun and, eventually, starting center Sophie Hart down the stretch of the season.\n \"It's a challenge to score without those two on the court,\" Plitzuweit said. \"The positive part of that is seeing different players step up.\"\n One shining bright spot was Battle. After a 32-point, seven-assist, five-rebound game in Wednesday's 77-69 victory over Rutgers, Battle scored 22 on 7-for-15 shooting. In two games, in more than 70 minutes of playing time at Target Center, Battle scored 54 points, had 10 assists, seven rebounds and only four turnovers.\n Freshman center Aiyanna Johnson scored 12 points on 5-for-10 shooting. Ajok Madol had a career-high 11 on 4-for-7 shooting. Johnson, Battle and Madol were a combined 16-for-32, but the rest of the team made only five field goals.\n And that wasn't enough to get past a Michigan attack led by all-­conference player Laila Phelia (23 points), Lauren Hanson (14) and Cameron Williams (11).\n Michigan had a 13-6 edge on points off turnovers, a 15-2 edge on second-chance points and a 36-24 edge in the paint. The Wolverines had 20 assists on 28 made field goals and committed only seven turnovers.\n After falling behind by 14 late in the first quarter, Battle made a buzzer-beating three from just inside the half-court stripe. Then the Gophers scored the first two buckets of the second quarter and that 14-point lead was down to seven. But, out of a timeout, Michigan responded with a 10-2 run to take back control of the game, as it turned out, for good.\n Afterward Plitzuweit said she hoped Minnesota's season hadn't ended. Their 16-14 record would qualify them for the WNIT tournament. And there is a chance that either Braun, Hart or both could return in time for that.\n \"Hopefully we have a chance to continue playing,\" Plitzuweit said. \"Our body of work, I think we put ourselves in position to keep playing. I hope we have a chance to do that.\"\n \"We're looking forward to continuing to grow our game,\" said forward Mallory Heyer. She struggled with her shot, scoring two points, but played strong defense and pulled down a career-high 17 rebounds.","length":14485,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T03:53:24.962Z","rating":[7,6,7,6,8,7,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the Gophers' loss to Michigan in the Big Ten women's basketball tournament, detailing the key moments of the game and players' performances.

Local councils have now been in existence for more than 30 years. Still, there is undeniable evidence that many local and regional councils are not performing as well as they should.\nA study by the Faculty for Social Well-being on how southern region residents judge the performance of their councils is revealing. The findings of this study are just as applicable and relevant to most other regions of the country. \nThe most noteworthy finding is that only slightly more than a third of respondents said they were satisfied with their local council. Less than a third were aware of councillors’ role and often expected services from the local councils beyond their administrative remit. \nIt is time to ask why taxpayer-financed local government is underperforming and what must be done to give citizens a better value for the money spent on local councils.\nMany of the gripes and frustration that residents must deal with relate to country-wide problems that are not being addressed with sufficient determination and competence by the central government. \nRespondents in this survey highlighted problems like excessive traffic, parking problems, noise and air pollution and inadequate public and green spaces. Waste management and road infrastructure failures are two other areas that fall under the responsibility of the central government, even if many residents still believe these are the local councils’ responsibility. \nIt is becoming clear that the local councils’ framework is too fragmented, with small localities having insufficient human and financial resources to manage the different public services. Still, it is a worrying reality that, over the past decade, local councils have been reduced to little more than public relations offices for the various government ministries. \nThe report made a recommendation for a policy reform that would allow mayors to hold office on a full-time basis. This is unlikely to make much difference. Similarly, the recent policy decision to allow 16-year-old elected councillors to serve as mayors will hardly help to optimise the performance of councils.\nThrowing money at the problem of local councils’ underperformance will not resolve the issue unless root and branch reform is undertaken. Local councils need more authority to address residents’ concerns rather than act as a complaints hub for frustrated citizens or rubberstamping their applications. It is no wonder that fewer individuals are interesting in contesting local elections. \nIt may be expedient to transfer some of the functions of local councils to regional councils to optimise the limited qualified human resources. \nMalta is becoming increasingly multi-ethnical, creating new challenges for local government. Councillors need to be trained to deal with the cultural impact of this phenomenon on the community they serve. \nHowever, local government can only optimise its potential to serve an increasingly diverse community if the central government embarks on a devolution of power through which local and regional councils will be empowered and given resources.  \nThe local council elections in June will be another litmus test of the credibility that the local government has with the community. It is futile to blame ordinary citizens’ lack of civic pride and community participation for their poor perception of the performance of local and regional councils.\nThe central government must engage in a soul-searching exercise with councillors and ordinary citizens to develop a new blueprint to upgrade community services through local and regional councils.","length":3752,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T07:00:00+01:00","rating":[6,7,7,5,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides some factual information backed by a study on the performance of local councils.

How we came to move the clock forward in the spring, and then push it back in the fall, is a tale that spans over more than a century — one that’s driven by two world wars, mass confusion at times and a human desire to bask in the sun for a long as possible. There’s been plenty of debate over the practice, but about 70 countries — about 40% of those across the globe — currently use what Americans call daylight saving time. \n AP AUDIO: Why are clocks set forward in the spring? Thank wars, confusion and a hunger for sunlight.\n Spring forward! AP correspondent Jennifer King reports with a little of the history behind Daylight Saving Time.\n Glenda Marchesoni, owner of Heritage House Clocks, adjusts a German clock at her shop Tuesday, March 5, 2024, in Farmers Branch, Texas. (AP Photo/LM Otero)\n While springing the clocks forward “kind of jolts our system,” the extra daylight gets people outdoors, exercising and having fun, says Anne Buckle, web editor at timeanddate.com, which features information on time, time zones and astronomy.\n“The really, really awesome advantage is the bright evenings, right?” she says. “It is actually having hours of daylight after you come home from work to spend time with your family or activities. And that is wonderful.”Here are some things to know so you’ll be conversant about the practice of humans changing time:HOW DID THIS ALL GET STARTED?In the 1890s, George Vernon Hudson, an astronomer and entomologist in New Zealand, proposed a time shift in the spring and fall to increase the daylight. And in the early 1900s, British home builder William Willett, troubled that people weren’t up enjoying the morning sunlight, made a similar push. But neither proposal gained enough traction to be implemented.\n FILE - People with bicycles meet at the clock park in Duesseldorf, Germany, Friday, April 24, 2020. (AP Photo/Martin Meissner, File)\nGermany began using daylight saving time during World War I with the thought that it would save energy. Other countries, including the United States, soon followed suit. During World War II, the U.S. once again instituted what was dubbed “war time” nationwide, this time year-round. \nIn the United States today, every state except Hawaii and Arizona observes daylight saving time. Around the world, Europe, much of Canada and part of Australia also implement it, while Russia and Asia don’t currently.INCONSISTENCY AND MASS CONFUSIONAfter World War II, a patchwork of timekeeping emerged across the United States, with some areas keeping daylight saving time and others ditching it.“You might have one town has daylight saving time, the neighboring town might have daylight saving time but start it and end it on different dates and the third neighboring town might not have it at all,” says David Prerau, author of the book “Seize the Daylight: The Curious and Contentious Story of Daylight Saving Time.”\n Electric Time Co. employee Walter Rodriguez cleans the face of an 84-inch Wegman clock at the plant in Medfield, Mass. Thursday, Oct. 30, 2008. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File)\n At one point, if riders on a 35-mile (56-kilometer) bus ride from Steubenville, Ohio, to Moundsville, West Virginia, wanted their watches to be accurate, they’d need to change them seven times as they dipped in and out of daylight saving time, Prerau says.So in 1966, the U.S. Congress passed the Uniform Time Act, which say states can either implement daylight saving time or not, but it has to be statewide. The act also mandates the day that daylight saving time starts and ends across the country.\nConfusion over the time change isn’t just something from the past. In the nation of Lebanon last spring, chaos ensued when the government announced a last-minute decision to delay the start of daylight saving time by a month — until the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Some institutions made the change and others refused as citizens tried to piece together their schedules. Within days, the decision was reversed.“It really turned into a huge mess where nobody knew what time it was,” Buckle says.WHAT WOULD IT BE LIKE IF WE DIDN’T CHANGE THE CLOCKS?Changing the clocks twice a year leads to a lot of grumbling, and pushes to either use standard time all year, or stick to daylight saving time all year often crop up. During the 1970s energy crisis, the U.S. started doing daylight saving time all year long, and Americans didn’t like it. With the sun not rising in the winter in some areas till around 9 a.m. or even later, people were waking up in the dark, going to work in the dark and sending their children to school in the dark, Prerau says.\n”It became very unpopular very quickly,” Prerau says. And, he notes, using standard time all year would mean losing that extra hour of daylight for eight months in the evenings in the United States.A NOD TO THE EARLY ADOPTERSIn 1908, the Canadian city of Thunder Bay — then the two cities of Fort William and Port Arthur — changed from the central time zone to the eastern time zone for the summer and fall after a citizen named John Hewitson argued that would afford an extra hour of daylight to enjoy the outdoors, says Michael deJong, curator/archivist at the Thunder Bay Museum.\n Technician Oleg Ryabtsev performs maintenance work on a clock in Minsk, Belarus, Saturday, March 29, 2008. (AP Photo/Sergei Grits, File)\n The next year, though, Port Arthur stayed on eastern time, while Fort William changed back to central time in the fall, which, predictably, “led to all sorts of confusion,” deJong says.\nToday, the city of Thunder Bay is on eastern time, and observes daylight saving time, giving the area, “just delightfully warm, long days to enjoy” in the summer, says Paul Pepe, tourism manager for Thunder Bay Community Economic Development Commission. The city, located on Lake Superior, is far enough north that the sun sets at around 10 p.m. in the summer, Pepe says, and that helps make up for their cold dark winters. Residents, he says, tend to go on vacations in the winter and stay home in the summer: “I think for a lot of folks here, the long days, the warm summer temperatures, it’s a vacation in your backyard.”","length":7591,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T06:08:05","rating":[7,7,8,6,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides a historical perspective on the practice of daylight saving time, tracing its origins back to the proposals of George Vernon Hudson and William Willett.

The President said the declaration would enable a rapid response and focus the nation’s efforts on the devastating effects of the dry spell. \nThe most affected areas are also the nation’s traditional agriculture regions. Zambia’s agriculture depends heavily on rainfed farming. \nArchbishop Chama has called for local and international support to supplement what the Government is doing. \n“Most of those affected will be those living in rural areas. They will be the most affected…Thus, our country, Zambia, is headed for a real disaster and a food security crisis that needs the support of the international community and all of us within the country. The Catholic Church, through its department of Caritas Zambia and partners, looks forward to being part of those who will be in solidarity with the people of Zambia as they face the looming food deficit,” said the Zambian prelate. \nBesides a threatened national food security, water and energy supply concerns have become urgent. It has not rained in Zambia for weeks on end.  \nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reacting to the declaration said the most affected are small-scale farmers who depend on rainfed cropping, livestock keepers and all community members who rely on natural water bodies and shallow wells for water. \nCrops, especially maize, legumes, ground nuts, millet, sorghum, and others, are withering in Zambia due to insufficient moisture content. Water points are drying up, making it difficult for people to access safe and clean water for domestic consumption. The pasture is drying up, making it difficult for livestock. The Price of food items and other essential commodities have continued to rise. \nFor Zambia, it has been one crisis after another. While still grappling with the lingering economic effects of Covid-19 and ongoing debt restructuring, the country has just emerged from a deadly cholera outbreak. Some Zambians have referenced the coronavirus outbreaks, cholera and the current drought as a “triple tragedy.”  \nOn Monday, 4 March, UNICEF in Zambia expressed concern, especially for the fate of children in Zambia, who it said are already at risk of increased vulnerability. \n“Climate change is taking a toll on children and youth in Zambia. We started the year responding to a cholera outbreak that has affected children across the country disproportionally, while the current drought threatens to worsen that situation by increasing the vulnerabilities of more than three million children. There is no time to waste. UNICEF, in close coordination with the UN family and partners, is supporting the Government to provide immediate lifesaving and life-sustaining assistance to the affected population, with a special focus on children and their families, while we strengthen the resilience of the most vulnerable,” said Dr. Penelope Campbell, Representative, UNICEF Zambia. \n Thank you for reading our article.

Pesticides used to target pest species can have off-target effects on beneficial insects. The impact of pesticides and other chemical inputs on insect species that are not pollinators remains little understood.\nThe UK has made international commitments to reducing the overall risk caused by pesticides by at least half by 2030, and has made statutory targets to halt and reverse species extinctions and decline in abundance by 2042.\nThese targets are ambitious and welcome - but are also narrow and incomplete. Numerous species and in some cases entire groups, some of which are vital for UK food security, are excluded. The National Action Plan for Sustainable Pesticide Use, a crucial policy to address both knowledge gaps and encourage reductions in pesticide usage, has been delayed by six-years.\nA sometimes contentious debate exists between nature conservation groups and agriculturalists regarding the use of conventional pesticides, but both sides acknowledge the importance of developing new solutions. Most witnesses did not see the prospect of insecticides being phased out entirely in agricultural use. However, the Committee heard strong evidence that the issues arising from insect decline go far wider than the loss of “charismatic” species like bees and other pollinators, to encompass less well understood players in our food supply chains and the wider ecosystems that support them and our environment.\nIn domestic gardens, the question is not food security but the great enjoyment, mental and physical health benefits and engaging the population, of all ages, in ecology.  The Royal Horticultural Society plans for its garden at Wisley to be 100% pesticide-free by 2025, except where absolutely necessary to deal with invasive species. The Committee says there is now an opportunity to work with such leading organisations to phase down the use of pesticides in domestic horticulture.\nApproximately 50% of the food consumed in the UK is imported, making it subject to vulnerabilities such as wars and accelerating climate change. It is integral to UK food security that issues regarding insect decline and food production are also addressed at an international level, and the UK Government should use its position in international forums to advocate for and address the issues highlighted in this report on a global scale.\nAbout half of the UK’s protected Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) are not in a good state and are failing to conserve biodiversity, and protected sites do not exist in isolation but are influenced by the quality of nature in the surrounding environment. Statutory requirements to improve SSSIs will go some way to prevent more insect species extinction but it is unlikely that these improvements will be sufficient to halt decline in species abundance. \nSubstantial knowledge gaps regarding insect and wider invertebrate populations must be rectified, and the Committee says Government must expand its knowledge and expertise, looking beyond the 'Red List' of species at risk of extinction to develop a ‘Baseline list’ with a wider view of progress against crucial biodiversity targets. It echoes the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee's recommendation that the Government should publish the delayed National Action Plan no later than May this year.\nThe Committee heard a concern that naturalist skills are declining in the UK. Much knowledge of smaller, lesser-known insect groups lies, as it always has done, with amateurs rather than professional academics. The Committee hopes the new Natural History GCSE will help to foster interest in all insects, especially their central role in ecology, for younger generations to come.\nScience, Innovation and Technology Committee Chair, Rt Hon Greg Clark said:\n“Food security depends on maintaining and improving the biodiversity essential to ecosystems, and so does the much wider environment that we depend on for our lives, livelihoods and well-being.\n“That we do not fully or perhaps even well understand much of how these natural systems work, or about the risks to them and important species that we may losing, must not be a cause for despair or apathy. Rather, let the concerns raised in this inquiry be a clarion call for renewed efforts, research, education and interest in our natural environment.\n“Let’s see the Government’s long-delayed plan for sustainable pest management, and work with the great range of passionate and committed organisations, expert and amateur, dedicated to recreating and realising the rich and biodiverse potential of the UK’s natural world.”","length":5420,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,8,8,6,9,7,8],"reason":"- Accuracy: The article provides accurate information on the current situation regarding insect decline and the calls for new government focus and support in the UK.\r\n  - Objectivity: The article presents a balanced perspective by highlighting the viewpoints of both nature conservation groups and agriculturalists regarding pesticide use.\r\n  - Clarity and Coherence: The article is well-structured and organized, making it easy for readers to follow the arguments and recommendations presented.\r\n  - Depth of Analysis: The analysis of the impact of pesticides on insect populations, the international commitments regarding pesticide reduction, and the importance of biodiversity is meaningful but could benefit from further depth.\r\n  - Language and Presentation: The language used in the article is clear, professional, and free of spelling or grammar errors.

There is a known issue at Meta with account takeovers caused by phone number recycling in the US, in which numbers abandoned are given to new telco customers without being unlinked from the old customer's accounts. A password reset request or two-factor authentication code sent to an old number be misused to gain illicit access. \nMeta is aware of the problem with account takeovers due to phone number recycling in particular, but brushed off responsibility for the matter last month, saying it's the telco's responsibility to address the problem.\n\"Facebook doesn't have control over telecom providers who reissue phone numbers or with users having a phone number linked to their Facebook account that is no longer registered to them,\" Meta told us last month. \nPatch time: Critical GitLab vulnerability exposes 2FA-less users to account takeovers\n\"There is a significant risk of financial harm to both the affected user and other individuals on the platform,\" the AGs said in their letter. With many users linking credit cards to their Facebook accounts, \"We have received a number of complaints of threat actors fraudulently charging thousands of dollars to stored credit cards.\" \nThe AGs said they've sent their letter to Meta, asking for immediate action to address the account takeover issues, whatever the cause. \n\"We request Meta take immediate action and substantially increase its investment in account takeover mitigation tactics, as well as responding to users whose accounts were taken over,\" the AG coalition said. \nAccording to Michigan AG Dana Nessel's office, the group is specifically urging Meta to increase staffing and adopt new account takeover protection procedures, including additional multi-step authentication measures. \nIt's not clear if the AGs have heard back from Meta, or whether they plan to take additional action if the matter isn't resolved to their satisfaction. We've asked, but haven't heard back.\nA Meta spokesperson told us that it already invests \"heavily\" in training its employees to detect compromised accounts, and that it regularly shares tips with users on how to protect their accounts.\n\"Scammers use every platform available to them and constantly adapt to evade enforcement,\" Meta told The Register in an emailed statement. ®","length":4005,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T21:45:15Z","rating":[5,5,7,6,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides an overview of the situation where 41 US state attorneys general have sent a letter to Meta addressing the issue of account takeovers on Facebook and Instagram.

Such a closure is unusual in Europe where weekly print publications for children have seen a renaissance in recent years.","textContent":"The editorial director of Journal des Enfants (JDE) had signalled the possible move months ago by saying that she had been told her weekly for children could not commit to any new joint actions with similar news outlets.“At a time when mistrust is plaguing the relationship between the French and the media, a brick from the base of this edifice is removed, further destabilising the structure,” read a staff statement released on Linkedin. “Who will the children of tomorrow trust to keep them informed? ” JDE has 9,000 subscribers in France and around the world. It was founded in 1984 by Béatrice d’Irube with the help of the regional newspaper l’Alsace, owned by the Crédit Mutuel bank. The Crédit Mutuel bank now owns the EBRA press group, which includes both.It was ground-breaking: France’s first newspaper to take children seriously as news consumers of real journalism. It won two WAN-IFRA World Young Reader Prizes for its work to explain press freedom to the young (2009) and its campaign to promote the importance of planting and nurturing trees (2016), plus a joint award for all France coverage of the 2015 Charlie Hebdo killings. Belgium’s Vers L’avenir used it as a model to start its own Journal des Enfants in 1992. Last year it created a partly free portal to support teachers with resources, lesson plans and teleconferences, especially about media literacy.Journal des Enfants offers a balanced news diet that includes a page of happy stories as well as explanations of world issuesEBRA spokeswoman Stella De Vivo said JDE needed to close “despite its high editorial quality.”“The reasons for this difficult decision are twofold,” she said. “There has been a very strong and long deterioration in the market for children’s publications. This is linked to significant competition both within the general press market and for youth magazines themselves.“JDE has also not been immune to the general difficulties encountered in the sector, notably substantial increases in paper and energy prices.”Such a closure is unusual in Europe where weekly print publications for children have seen a renaissance in recent years. But none of those outlets contend with a level of competition for the roughly 9- to 12-year-old core audience that JDE has faced in France. While challenges have come from the diverse portfolio of the formidable Bayard Jeunesse and from some smaller entities, its main competitor has been PlayBac Press. After creating a first home-delivered daily for children in 1995, Mon Quotidien for ages 10 to 13, PlayBac followed soon with editions for age groups slightly younger (7-10) and older (over 13). Founding editor François Dufour has long tried to nudge his audience toward online, but they still will have none of it and want print. The combined paid circulation in early 2023 for the two editions covering JDE’s range of 7- to 13-year-olds was about 50,000, down from pre-pandemic days like all the French press, but still a large chunk of the market. PlayBac has at least a slight cushion with additional revenue streams, notably a separate Special Editions department that does paid-for educational content for children and a robust educational games division. “It’s always sad to watch a newspaper for kids die,” said Jerôme Saltet, another founder of PlayBac “In this case, I don’t know why JDE is stopping. Anyway, it’s bad news. Our daily newspapers for kids are not exactly in the same market due to our strong belief: “It’s easier to ask a kid to read 10 minutes a day than 1 hour a week.”Whether daily or weekly, the approach to that audience requires a lot of never-ending work, says Corinne Vorms of Bayard Jeunesse:“You have to bear in mind that every year, a children’s magazine loses 1/3 of its readers because, quite simply, they’ve grown up,” she explains. “So you must therefore attract a new third of your readership to maintain and develop circulation. Meeting this challenge is a major marketing and communications challenge.”Boosting print profits while promoting the goodPublishers in some other European countries have found doing journalism for children in a weekly print format can add to the parent company’s bottom line.  This is at least in part because of the particular journalistic DNA shared by modern news products for children regardless of platform that JDE minted 40 years ago: treating real news, especially news children cannot avoid, with succinct but carefully crafted journalism and context, an emphasis on solutions and media literacy.These editors also give extensive attention to audience members’ mental health with a story mix that doesn’t depress and even regular psychological advice. One recent example of this was coverage of the start of the latest Middle East crisis that allowed these outlets to shine, partly because of their restraint.“We don’t aim to inform them about every tragedy in the world,” explains Simon Thinggaard Hjortkjær, editor of Denmark’s Børneavisen. But we certainly want to help them understand if they have already heard about this in mainstream news sources, on social media or elsewhere. The children’s news market is so important in Germany that it gets a designated editor at the national Deutsche Press-Agentur wire service to serve the mainly regional news companies whose editors are also able to support a pay-to-join national interest group. Building healthy news habitsLately, a key selling-point advantage for print versus digital approaches is that print gets children off screens for a while. (However, digital news for children is getting serious traction in the online space swamp, a topic we’ll  treat in a follow-up story.)Leading publishers in Austria, Denmark, Norway and Finland deem their print weeklies worth the work. Kleine Zeitung counts on its children’s editions as both an investment in its future and as profit centres now. Kleine Kinderzeitung began in 2004 as a subscription weekly and now also offers some free online content.It was followed in 2017 with the larger, wide-ranging Pausenzeitung. That publication serves teachers each month during the school year and made that educational emphasis clear from the start with the cover story about media literacy in its first edition titled “Don’t believe everything!” Walter Hauser, head of reader/user market at Kleine Zeitung, credits a multi-pronged approach for the success. “We have a flourishing subscription business for Kleine Kinderzeitung, and with Kleine Pausenzeitung we are publishing a subscription product for schools,” he explained. “We licensed both products to other publishers, and we developed innovative products for the ad markets.”  Those products include supplements with branded educational material.Norway’s Aftenposten Junior, founded in 2012, reached profitability in six months and now has a circulation of about 30,000. In 2020, it began a digital school edition (Junior skole) and has launched a science-focused spin-off magazine. Like Hauser, Audun Solberg, editor-in-chief of the parent Aftenposten (Schibsted News Media), also first emphasises the mission of “contributing to children acquiring new knowledge and information about the society around them, through journalism that meets Aftenposten’s demands for quality and ethical standards.”Aftenposten Junior will continue to be profitable, she says, thanks to individual subscribers and collaborating with teachers and schools to provide“up-to-date information that can be integrated into the curriculum.”  However, all has not been profitable for Schibsted in this sector. It licensed the concept to Postimees Juunior in Estonia starting in 2019. That supplement was gone within three years amid tepid reader response. Alternatives to digitalFinland’s Lasten Uutiset has done research to confirm why a weekly print product for children works there. “Basically we exist as a print entity since it seems to be what the kids and parents want,” says Fanny Fröman, who directs youth initiatives for the parent company, Helsingin Sanomat. “Our reader surveys show that kids like the print format, and parents are eager to buy kids something that is not digital.”Founded in 2016, Lasten Uutiset was first a free weekly news broadcast also available on YouTube and now seen regularly in most of Finland’s primary schools. The company added a home-delivered, subscription print weekly of the same name in 2020. The print weekly for children was profitable within months of its founding and now has 18,000 subscribers, Fröman says. A least one publisher outside Europe is investing more in its print edition for children, partly to attract “reluctant readers.” Straits Times (Singapore) began The Little Red Dot weekly in 2005. It has regularly won international awards since then, serving as a model for excellent practice.“The team behind it had noticed that our children reading it had of course evolved as a generation,” explains Straits Times editor Jaime Ho. “Their needs and tastes had changed, and there was a need to sharpen the way the title catered to them.

He ate lunch with his parents.“His father went out to walk the dogs. On his return, Mr Kingston was not in the house. After approximately 30 minutes, his mother went to look for him.“His father forced entry into an outbuilding when he couldn’t gain entry. Mr Kingston was found inside with a catastrophic head injury. A gun was present at the scene.Emergency services were called. Police are satisfied the death is not suspicious.”The hearing, at Gloucestershire Coroner’s Court, lasted less than minutes. Several journalists and a Buckingham Palace representative were present but no family members.\n\t\t\t\tThomas Kingston was a committed Christian who once worked as a hostage negotiator in Iraq\n Kingston once worked as a hostage negotiator in Iraq. Known as Tom, he read economic history at the University of Bristol before joining the diplomatic missions unit at the Foreign Office.He was seconded to Baghdad as project manager for the International Centre for Reconciliation, based at Coventry Cathedral, in 2003. The following year, he cheated death in a suicide bombing in the Iraqi capital that killed 22 people.Rev Canon Andrew White, then the vicar of St George’s Church, the only Anglican church in Iraq, worked closely with him.He described him as a fearless and very committed Christian, telling The Telegraph: “I loved him so much. The thing about Tom was he was never scared. Whatever I asked him to do, he would do it with a big smile on his face in the middle of a war zone.” Kingston returned to the UK to work for Schroders, the global asset management firm, as an equity analyst before becoming the managing director of Voltan Capital Management and later a director of Devonport Capital, which provides short-term loans to businesses operating in the developing world.His father was a hugely successful barrister, specialising in planning law. Also a devout Christian, he was elected to the General Synod in 2016.  His mother, Jill, is a trustee of a Christian healing centre and runs the Nadezhda Charitable Trust, which supports projects in Zimbabwe. Kingston was introduced to his royal bride by mutual friends and proposed on the car-free Channel Island of Sark, where his parents have a holiday home.Lady Gabriella’s father, Prince Michael, is Elizabeth II’s first cousin and a grandson of George V. The couple married at St George’s Chapel Windsor in May 2019, in a lavish ceremony attended by an array of senior royals including the late Queen and Prince Philip.The couple were said to have been happily married to the end and were most recently pictured together, beaming for the camera, on Valentine’s Day.\n\t\t\t\tLady Gabriella Windsor paid tribute to Thomas Kingston, calling him 'an exceptional man who lit up the lives of all who knew him'\n Buckingham Palace announced Kingston’s death on Tuesday evening. Lady Gabriella, paid tribute to her husband, describing him as “an exceptional man who lit up the lives of all who knew him.” She said his death had come as a “great shock to the whole family.”Buckingham Palace said the King and Queen joined Prince and Princess Michael of Kent and all those who knew Kingston in grieving “a much-loved member of the family”.A spokesman said: “In particular, Their Majesties send their most heartfelt thoughts and prayers to Gabriella and all the Kingston family.”The brief hearing offered no clues to the reason behind Kingston’s death.The news left friends and family stunned. Many have insisted that he and Lady Gabriella, who lived in London, were happily married and had no known financial difficulties.Some have speculated that the traumas Kingston witnessed in Baghdad might have had long term effects but if so, they appear to have been hidden.Canon White said this week of their time in Iraq: “We survived several suicide bomb attacks. We were regularly caught up in IED [improvised explosive device] attacks. Cars would blow up in front of us and we would just move on. We were always together and had 35 armed guards at all times.”Both men are said to have been in Canon White’s Anglican church when it was targeted in a suicide-bomb attack. They entered the building just before the blast, which killed two of the congregation and 20 others.The Kingston family is being supported by Buckingham Palace, which along with the police, has taken measures to protect their privacy for their own safety and security.Prince and Princess Michael attended a memorial service on Tuesday for King Constantine of Greece at St George’s Chapel.Lady Gabriella, known to friends as Ella, who was a goddaughter to the late King, stayed away as she was comforted by her family.","length":6427,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[9,8,7,6,8,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate and detailed information about the tragic incident surrounding Thomas Kingston's death, including the circumstances, the post-mortem findings, and the reactions from family and Buckingham Palace.

Justice RN Manjula observed that providing compassionate appointment was like fulfilling the unwritten will of the deceased government servant, and required an understanding of how the deceased employee would have wished his dependents to settle in life if he was alive. The court, thus, noted that the authorities needed to consider the applications with both sympathy and empathy. “The matters of compassion not only requires an understanding by getting into the shoes of the applicant but also in the shoes of the deceased government servant, like how the deceased would have wished to settle his dependents in life, if he was alive. So providing compassionate appointment is more or like fulfilling an unwritten Will of the deceased government servant. Hence in the matters of compassionate appointment granting the appointment can be the rule and denying it may be an exception,” the court observed. The court was hearing a plea seeking to declare certain paras in the Bank's circular as unconstitutional, discriminatory, arbitrary and unreasonable, and violative of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The concerned para excluded a married daughter from the definition of “dependent family member/wholly dependent daughter” for getting a compassionate appointment. The plea also challenged the bank's decision to reject the petitioner's application for compassionate appointment on the ground that she was married at the time of her father's death. The bank submitted that though the married daughter was entitled to compassionate appointment, she had to be wholly dependent on her father. It was submitted that when the deceased government servant had previously applied for Leave Travel Concession, the petitioner's name was not included. It was also pointed out that the petitioner was working as a Nurse in a private hospital but had left the job on her own and thus she was not wholly dependent on the income of her father. Rejecting this submission, the court pointed out that an application for leave travel concession could not be the basis for rejecting the married daughter's application for a compassionate appointment. The court further pointed out that while married daughters had crossed the first challenge of coming under the ambit of the compassionate scheme, they continued to face challenges and were expected to prove that they were depending on the income of the father. The court added that while married sons found it easier to continue living in the family home when married daughters chose to live in their parents' house, it raised eyebrows and was considered unusual. The court further observed that even when a married woman was dependent on her parents for various reasons, it was preferably not revealed either of the daughter's own volition or because it was considered below the dignity of the husband's family. Thus, the court remarked that married daughters could not be forced to produce records to show that they were fully or partially dependent on the father's income. The court highlighted that such matters had to be dealt with with an empathetic approach and not a pedantic approach attached to routine filed and formalities. The court thus quashed the order of the authorities rejecting the petitioner's request for a compassionate appointment and directed them to reconsider her application.

The IIA noted the importance of transparency in order to provide confidence to all stakeholders, including the public.\nThe SEC’s final rule, “The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,” requires registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in their registration statements and annual reports. The key disclosures include:\nMaterial Climate-Related Risks: Registrants must disclose risks related to climate change that have significantly impacted or are reasonably likely to impact their business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\nMitigation and Adaptation Activities: Information about activities undertaken to mitigate or adapt to climate-related risks should be included.\nBoard Oversight: Details regarding the board of directors’ oversight of climate-related risks must be disclosed.\nManagement’s Role: Registrants should provide insights into management’s role in managing material climate-related risks.\nClimate-Related Targets or Goals: If any climate-related targets or goals significantly impact the registrant’s business, results, or financial condition, they should be disclosed.\nThese requirements aim to enhance transparency and standardization in climate-related disclosures, ensuring that investors have relevant information to make informed decisions. The rule is in effect 60 days after it is published in the Federal Register.\nFor internal auditors, the final rule involves new areas of review and assurance to the board regarding compliance with the new rule. The IIA pledged to work with the SEC to provide guidance on implementing the new rule.\n“The internal audit function plays a vital role in corporate governance and managing risk in organizations across industries of all sizes. However, publicly traded companies face unique and often complex reporting requirements, which create added risks, given the responsibility they have to their shareholders,” said IIA President and CEO Anthony Pugliese, CIA, CPA, CGMA, CITP. “We’re committed to providing our members with training and guidance on how the rule may impact the internal audit function within publicly traded companies and the steps they should take to ensure their organizations are compliant.”\nInternal auditors play a central role in the Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) landscape, helping to ensure regulatory compliance and promoting best practices in their organizations. To that end, The IIA is committed to working with the SEC and other stakeholders on ESG-related issues and other emerging areas that impact the profession.","length":3416,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T18:23:00+00:00","rating":[8,8,9,7,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the Institute of Internal Auditors reviewing SEC's new Climate Change Disclosure Rule, highlighting key requirements and the significance of transparency.

Or one who is “conscientious and ardent” is pursuit of the client’s...","textContent":"Litigators, which would you rather be: a “zealous advocate” for your client? Or one who is “conscientious and ardent” is pursuit of the client’s interests?\nMost litigators, we suspect, would choose the latter description today. It fairly implies that litigators may, in their pursuit of the client’s interest, be required to balance other important considerations. These include the duty of candor toward the court, as well as the somewhat aspirational duty to treat opponents, witnesses, and others in the justice system, in a civil and professional manner.\nSome legal experts believe that the continued use of the word “zealous” in professional ethics codes is holding back progress toward a fairer civil justice system. They worry that language in ethics codes calling for “zealous” advocacy is being cited as a get-out-of-jail-free card for ethical transgressions.\nThis isn’t to say that litigators don’t wear the mantle “zealous advocate” with pride. They do. The principle that everyone is entitled to a zealous advocate is deeply engrained in the U.S. legal system. But lawyers are also responsible for the trustworthiness of the legal system. And this responsibility can on occasion compete with the need for zealous advocacy.\nAdditionally, “zealous,” as a description of anyone – lawyer or nonlawyer – hasn’t aged well as a matter of English usage. Nobody wants to be called a zealot. Increasingly, it suggests an unreasonable, inflexible, and fanatical attitude toward litigation that is inconsistent with evolving professional norms. And some litigators invoke “zealous advocacy” as an excuse to engage in unethical conduct.\nIn his article Eight Traits of Great Trial Lawyers, federal district court judge Mark W. Bennett advocated for reasonableness – not zealousness – as the mark of a great trial lawyer. Some legal experts believe that the continued use of the word “zealous” in professional ethics codes is holding back progress toward a fairer civil justice system. They worry that language in ethics codes calling for “zealous” advocacy is being cited as a get-out-of-jail-free card for ethical transgressions.\nThirty-nine jurisdictions across the United States use the word “zealous” or a close variant to describe a lawyer’s duty to advocate on behalf of the client. The American Bar Association’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct, on which most state legal ethics codes are based, describes the lawyer’s obligation in its preamble:\nAs advocate, a lawyer zealously asserts the client’s position under the rules of the adversary system.\nEleven jurisdictions have chosen to go a different direction, softening former demands for “zealous” advocacy from litigators in favor of milder definitions that align with growing calls for professionalism and civility in professional life. In recent years, Arizona, California, Indiana, Maine, Ohio, and Washington have all removed the word “zealous” or its variants from their professional ethics codes. Legal ethics codes in Louisiana, Montana, Nevada, and Oregon do not use the word “zealous” either – however, it’s unclear whether the term was ever present in their rules.\nWashington state is a good example of these reformers’ views. In 2006, the Washington Supreme Court substituted the phrase “conscientious and ardent” advocacy for “zealous” advocacy in its rules of professional conduct. Similarly, in 2002, a Maine state ethics task force recommended dropping the word “zeal” from comments in the legal ethics code because, it said, the word had been frequently used to justify inappropriate behavior.\nNow it appears Florida is poised to become the latest state to drop an explicit call for “zealous” advocacy from its legal ethics code. According to a January 2024 submission to the Florida Supreme Court from Florida state bar legal ethics experts, the term “zeal” and its variants are too-often associated with negative extremist behavior and character. The group recommended deletion of the word “zealously” and the addition of the phrase “commitment and dedication to the interests of the client” in the state’s lawyer ethics code.\n“During the course of our research, zeal especially in today’s vernacular, has a generally negative connotation and may be equated to someone who goes to extremes, which is not something that we want to aspire to in our Rules,” the group wrote. “We propose that any word which can be used as justification for unprofessional behavior should not be in our Rules which are intended to reflect our best practices.”\nThe Florida Supreme Court has yet to act on the proposed ethics revisions, though it could do so soon. Just last week, the court hinted that it has no patience for attorneys who defend accusations of unethical behavior with the claim that they are merely providing zealous advocacy for their clients.\nIn Florida Bar v. Schwartz, No. SC2019-0983 (Fla., Jan. 18, 2024), the court remarked that an attorney had engaged in “increasingly inappropriate conduct under the guise of zealous representation.” Entering an order of disbarment for several ethical transgressions, the court said that the ethical requirement to provide “zealous representation” is not “a sword to wield as an excuse to otherwise engage in misconduct.”\nWe’ve already reported that professionalism, as an ideal and in practice, is rising within the legal profession. Depositions are, fortunately, an infrequent source of unprofessional conduct (in fact, the decision to videotape a deposition has been shown to be a potent weapon against incivility and unprofessional conduct). Actions by state bar regulators in Florida and elsewhere to remove “zealous” as a professional ideal promise to further improve the experience of everyone involved in discovery depositions.","length":5859,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,9,7,7,8,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the debate surrounding the usage of the term \"zealous\" in legal ethics codes and its potential implications.

A great deal of that was down to one man, as while Jose Mourinho was a black hole of negativity, an emotional vortex sucking the joy out of the sport on the touchline, Daniele De Rossi shows what the Roma spirit really is.Can you imagine if Mou had been on that bench, would his team have come out fighting like that from the very start, pinning Inter back and forcing the runaway league leaders on the defensive? Even less likely is having the self-appointed Special One using the kind of words that De Rossi did both before and after this match. That is where the true difference lies and why sacking Mourinho was the best decision the Friedkins could’ve made.In the build-up, De Rossi focused not on how decimated his own squad was, on how very strong the opposition seemed, on the practical impossibility of the task they were faced with. Instead, he assured that “every team is beatable” and there was no reason why Roma couldn’t be the ones to prove that against the Inter juggernaut. What a blessed relief to hear words of encouragement and positivity after Mourinho’s endless moaning about the lack of resources, culminating in his plea: “I am not a magician. I am not Harry Potter.”The facts are that this is a good Roma squad, more than capable of challenging for a top four spot now that Napoli are floundering. They have an excellent youth academy to draw upon, plenty of internationals in the side, and must be encouraged to believe in themselves rather than be treated as a millstone around the neck of a legendary coach. No, Mourinho, this Roma side was not holding you back. You were holding them back.Even more refreshing was hearing De Rossi in his post-match press conference assuring that he would not have considered Marcus Thuram’s offside position to be interfering with play on the Francesco Acerbi goal. After almost three years of non-stop sackcloth and ashes at every single refereeing decision – or scheduling choice, or the weather, or anything else that could be blamed rather than his own errors – what a blessed relief to have a Roma coach who did not seek an alibi.De Rossi had his own fair share of red cards as a player and was known to lose his temper on occasion, but he now realises the responsibility of the new role and wants to set that example not just for his squad, but the fans too. Whereas Mourinho’s ranting and raving – which he was still going on about in an unrelated interview just before his dismissal – after the Europa League Final resulted in referee Anthony Taylor and his family getting chairs thrown at them in the airport the next day, De Rossi refuses to tap into the victim mentality that the Portuguese coach instead fuelled with paranoid ravings.What a wonderful sight to have a Roma coach who so clearly and loudly believes in his players, his club, his fans and his future. Mourinho always acted as if he was slumming it at the Olimpico, but De Rossi would rather be nowhere else.","length":3462,"publishedTime":"2024-02-10T22:18:52+00:00","rating":[8,9,8,7,9,7,8],"reason":"The article provides a balanced perspective on the comparison between Daniele De Rossi and Jose Mourinho, highlighting De Rossi as a positive and refreshing figure for Roma amidst Mourinho's negativity.

Our journey began at the very heart of this town, where the Vieux Bassin, a centuries-old harbor, serves as a focal point for both locals and visitors alike.\nThe waterfront is a bustling tapestry of activity, with fishing boats gently bobbing in the water and waterfront cafes lining the quays. As a family, we couldn’t resist the allure of the inviting eateries, and we settled into a charming café with a perfect view of the harbor. Sipping on rich French coffee, we watched the comings and goings of boats and pedestrians.\nWandering through the narrow streets, we discovered hidden gems at every turn. Saint Catherine’s Church, a remarkable wooden structure dating back to the 15th century, captivated us with its unique architecture, a sign of the rich maritime history of the town and a testament to the craftsmanship of its artisans.\nOne of the highlights of our visit was the Eugene Boudin Museum, dedicated to the renowned Impressionist painter who found inspiration in Honfleur’s landscapes. The museum houses an impressive collection of Boudin’s works, showcasing the artist’s ability to capture the ever-changing moods of the sky and sea. As we strolled through the exhibits, it felt as though we were walking in the footsteps of an artistic genius.\nHonfleur’s charm extends beyond its cultural and historical attractions. The town is a haven for art enthusiasts, with numerous galleries dotting the streets. We found ourselves drawn into the vibrant art scene, where local artists showcased their talents in mediums ranging from oil paintings to sculptures. The atmosphere was infused with creativity, and we couldn’t resist bringing a piece of Honfleur’s artistic spirit home with us.\nOur exploration of Honfleur wouldn’t be complete without indulging in its culinary delights. The local seafood, sourced fresh from the English Channel, took center stage on our dinner table. From succulent mussels to delicate sea bass, each dish was a celebration of the region’s maritime bounty. We discovered a charming boulangerie that became our daily pilgrimage, offering an irresistible array of baguettes, croissants, and pastries that fueled our adventures.\nAs the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the harbor, we gathered at the water’s edge to witness a mesmerizing spectacle—the nightly illumination of the Pont de Normandie. The bridge, gracefully spanning the Seine estuary, transformed into a radiant display of lights, reflecting off the water below. It was a fitting finale to our Honfleur experience, a town that had woven its magic into the fabric of our family memories.","length":3424,"publishedTime":"2024-03-06T14:03+00:00","rating":[8,7,9,7,8,9,9],"reason":"The article provides detailed and accurate information about Honfleur, capturing the essence of the town's charm and attractions.

The British singer-songwriter — who studied psychology at University of Greenwich for one year before dropping out to focus on music — sat down to compose and felt inspired by the idea that \"a child is like a blank sheet of paper.\"\n\"I was trying to write a birthday present for my younger brother [Joshua] who was 14, which is why I think the song resonates with teenagers because it's really what you need to hear at that age,\" Bedingfield, now 42, tells PEOPLE.\n\"It's what I wish I heard at that age, that you don't really have to have it all figured out. It's such a stressful question everyone loves to ask you, 'What are you going to be, what are you going to do?' And it's too much to really know the answer to that at that stage. You just have to write it a day at a time,\" she adds.\nNow, 20 years later, \"Unwritten\" has reached new heights after it was featured in the Shakespeare-inspired rom-com Anyone But You, starring Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell. In the film, Bedingfield's hit song plays a pivotal role in the film as Powell's \"serenity song\" and multiple characters sing its memorable lyrics throughout the film.\n\"It really feels like Anyone But You is about 'Unwritten,' like 'Unwritten' is almost a character in the movie,\" she says. \"My publisher and Will Gluck, the director, they were like, 'Look, it's a big moment in the movie.' So, I believed them. But when I watched the movie, I was like, 'Wow.'\"\nThe \"These Words\" singer has also loved watching fans lean in to the fun on social media: \"It's kind of incredible the way that it's lifting everyone up.\"\nA rom-com lover herself, Bedingfield — whose song \"Pocketful of Sunshine\" was featured in the 2010 film Easy A, led by Emma Stone — says she writes about \"real things\" and approaches lyricism like \"comedy writer.\"\n\"I use music to get to the light at the end of the tunnel,\" she says. \"Music connects me to everything that's good and to my higher power and my higher self and to others. And so my music is very optimistic because it's chasing the light.\"\nDespite her natural optimism in music, Bedingfield says she often enjoys listening to \"sad songs\" — and music that \"wakes your spirit up\" like Bon Iver, Damien Rice and Rage Against the Machine.\nAnd since Powell's character's serenity song is \"Unwritten\" — what's Bedingfield's? If she had to chose, she says it's India.Arie's \"Get It Together.\"\nNext, Bedingfield — whose most recent album Roll with Me — plans to release new music and currently feels inspired by \"who we are and the struggle of being who we are.\"\n\"It's the same kind of things, I just see different sides of those issues. Like now, I feel a lot more confident than I was 20 years ago, but I'm also more experienced,\" she says.\n\"The No. 1 lesson is to have fun,\" Bedingfield adds. \"Don't take yourself too serious.\"","length":3264,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,6,8,6,7,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about Natasha Bedingfield, her career, inspirations behind her song \"Unwritten,\" and its resurgence in the movie \"Anyone But You.\" It maintains objectivity by primarily focusing on Bedingfield's quotes and experiences without injecting personal bias.

Drug candidates originally designed to build, preserve or regenerate skeletal muscle for treating muscle atrophy in degenerative conditions or ageing are now being tested in combination with GLP-1 agonists used for obesity to spare lean muscle.Skeletal muscle takes a hit during weight loss. To reduce the impact on muscle mass, biotechs are pairing obesity drugs with exercise mimetics.\n Credit: BSIP SA / Alamy Stock PhotoOne such biotech is BioAge Labs. In February, the company announced a $170-million series D financing, which will allow it to combine its apelin receptor agonist azelaprag (BGE-105) with Eli Lilly’s GLP-1 agonist Mounjaro (tirzepatide) in phase 2 studies. The combination preserved lean body tissue in phase 1 studies and animal models and boosted weight loss by 10–15% compared with Mounjaro alone, effectively “supercharging” weight loss, says BioAge co-founder and CEO Kristen Fortney. “You get a profound, profound synergy,” Fortney says. “We see not only an amplification of weight loss but also an improvement of body composition and function, which is really exciting.”The news came on the heels of Regeneron’s intention to launch a phase 2 trial pairing the company’s muscle-preservation monoclonal antibodies (the anti-myostatin trevogrumab and the anti-activin A garetosmab) alongside Novo Nordisk’s Ozempic (semaglutide). “If you can lose more fat by preserving your muscle, then that’s the best of all worlds,” says David Glass, vice president of research for aging and age-related disorders at Regeneron. “That’s really what we’re trying to achieve.”What used to be a pharmaceutical dead zone is now coming alive, with at least ten compounds in development to improve muscle mass, boost strength or prevent muscle loss, a condition known as sarcopenia (Table 1). “For the longest time, people have talked about skeletal muscle function as being undruggable, but in the last ten years or so, that has changed,” says Daniel Rooks, executive director, musculoskeletal translational medicine at Novartis Biomedical Research. Industry insiders will be closely watching those clinical trials launching in 2024, says Rooks.Table 1 Selected agents in clinical trials for the prevention of muscle lossFull size tableBeginning at age 30, humans lose on average 3–8% of their muscle mass per decade, and this accelerates after age 60. In old age, muscle loss or sarcopenia leads to reduced mobility and is linked to falls, frailty and cardiovascular disease. Nathan LeBrasseur, director of the Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging at the Mayo Clinic, says that the problem with targeting sarcopenia is that it is generally seen as a symptom of aging and prolonged immobility rather than a stand-alone condition. Standard interventions for sarcopenia include strength training and nutritional counseling to ensure adequate protein consumption. In theory, this approach is extremely effective, LeBrasseur says. But the presence of other chronic conditions, inflammation, injuries and mobility challenges can make it hard for people to recover.A prime need is a treatment to help adults hospitalized for hip fractures, says Fortney. The prolonged immobilization needed for bone healing makes it almost impossible for many patients to regain their former strength and physical endurance.Pharma’s early muscle-directed efforts were mostly focused on ramping up testosterone and blocking myostatin, a negative regulator of myogenesis. Mice and dogs that lack myostatin have double the muscle mass of their wild-type counterparts. To pharma, myostatin seemed like the perfect target, says Rooks. But early myostatin inhibitors trialed in adults did not create super-buff humans or even a meaningful increase in muscle strength, and pharma seemed to lose interest.Biotech companies have now cast a wider net, identifying and zooming in on different mechanisms that control muscle mass. One potential approach is to block activin, a protein through which myostatin sends its muscle atrophy signals. It’s the strategy used by Versanis Bio, a biotech acquired by Lilly in July 2023 for $1.925 billion. Academic scientists have shown that the myostatin–activin pathway also has a profound influence on fat accumulation, emphasizing the deep biological links between muscle and adipose tissue, both in humans and in animal models. A team at University of Toulouse in France treated mouse models of chronic kidney disease with a synthetic version of apelin. They found that apelin treatment partially ameliorated the usual muscle loss that accompanies kidney disease.Another potential target is the mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTORC1), a pathway involved in controlling muscle size. mTORC1 activation promotes muscle building, but if constantly stimulated it can also induce muscle breakdown by activating proteasome degradation. Others are looking to promote muscle regeneration by stimulating muscle stem cells, tweaking variables such as the stiffness of the extracellular matrix or engineering extracellular vesicles to deliver therapeutics.Immunis and Juvena Therapeutics are zooming in on the muscle stem cell secretome — the collection of proteins, including growth factors, cytokines, chemokines and extracellular matrix components, secreted by muscle cells. The secretome kicks in to boost proliferation in response to exercise or to enhance cellular interactions to accelerate wound healing, for example, and it declines markedly with age.For Paris-based Biophytis, the focus is on the shared pathways between age-related sarcopenia and neuromuscular disease such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Its lead candidate is ruvembri (BIO101), a small molecule that targets the MAS receptor, which is present in cardiorespiratory and skeletal muscles. MAS activates the AKT and AMPK kinase pathways downstream, stimulating protein synthesis and energy production, respectively.“There is a clear impact not only on skeletal muscle but also cardiorespiratory muscles, both of which are very important for mobility,” says Stanislas Veillet, founder and CEO of Biophytis.Such similarities between skeletal and cardiac muscle will open other crossover uses. “We started our work focused on cardiac muscle, but we very rapidly recognized that what we were doing was applicable to all muscle types,” says Robert Blum, president and CEO of Cytokinetics, a company developing drugs to treat heart failure.BioAge, another Bay Area biotech, has applied its AI-powered platform to identify an oral apelin receptor agonist called azelaprag. It is in phase 2 testing to prevent muscle loss. Apelin has been dubbed an “exerkine,” as it is a peptide hormone involved in glucose and lipid metabolism that is released in response to physical activity. The company is trialing an apelin mimic to replicate these effects in older adults. Results from a phase 1b trial showed that azelaprag significantly reduced muscle atrophy in healthy adults aged 65 and up compared with placebo.Companies with muscle-building drugs are now blazing a trail in obesity studies to counter the skeletal muscle atrophy that accompanies fat-loss treatments. The often dramatic weight loss experienced by people who have undergone bariatric surgery or are taking GLP-1 agonists such as Mounjaro and Ozempic leads to the loss of muscle as well as fat. As a consequence, biopharma companies are on the lookout for drugs to use alongside GLP-1 agonists to preserve lean muscle mass. BioAge has teamed up with Lilly to begin testing its apelin agonist, azelaprag, in people taking Lilly’s weight loss drug. In obese mice, the combination increased weight loss and preserved lean body tissue compared with Mounjaro alone. Apelin increases metabolism and improves glucose uptake by cells, thus improving insulin sensitivity.Biohaven is conducting a phase 3 trial of taldefgrobep alfa, a myostatin inhibitor, to improve muscle mass in spinal muscular atrophy. The recombinant protein works by lowering myostatin directly as well as blocking activin signaling pathways. The drug proved successful in preserving muscle mass during weight loss in an obesity mouse model, prompting Biohaven to test it in combination with Ozempic in phase 2 trials.Muscle-building agents — with a view to combinations — are driving hefty acquisitions. Lilly’s acquisition of Versanis and its drug bimagrumab is an example. The monoclonal antibody was initially developed by Novartis for use in a muscle disorder known as sporadic inclusion body myositis. Trials showed that the drug did not lead to significant differences in muscle function, although it did help adults with a body mass index over 25 reduce body fat, perhaps by increasing metabolic rate. Versanis later licensed the drug and is now taking it through phase 2b trials in combination with Ozempic. For many in the field, the potential applications for sarcopenia therapeutics in the treatment of obesity represents a huge promise — and a huge payoff.“Muscle is critically important for movement and function, but it’s also our largest metabolic organ,” says LeBrasseur.","length":9547,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,8,9,7,8,8,7],"reason":"The article scores high in accuracy as it provides detailed information on various companies testing muscle-building agents to counteract muscle loss due to weight loss and aging.

So far, there have been more than 100 people expressing interest. \n“Community science projects are a great way to get a lot of information,” said Dakota Stankowski, the department’s aquatic invasive species coordinator.\nThe zebra mussel, so named because of its distinct black and off-white striped shell, is a small bivalve, no more than an inch and a half long in adult form.  \nSmall as they are, they can cause big problems, especially in large numbers. Stankowski said they can wreak havoc on local ecosystems by consuming all the nutrients in an area, denying them to other animals such as fish. \nStankowski said they also like to attach to hard surfaces. With sharp edges on their shells, they can be dangerous.\n“When they’re attached to, say, a rock at the bottom of a lake, all of a sudden there’s a bunch of zebra mussels attached. If someone swimming were to walk on that rock, they could cut up their feet,” she said. \nThe mussels can clog equipment intakes too, Stankowski said, making them a nuisance for boat motors, water pipes and filtration systems.  \nElsewhere in the country, such as the Great Lakes and out west, she said, the zebra mussels have even caused problems for hydroelectric dams.\nWildlife officials in Maine first became concerned in 2022, when their counterparts in Canada found the mussels in Lake Témiscouata, in southeastern Quebec. Stankowski said that’s a problem, because the lake connects via the Madawaska River to the St. John River, which runs along part of Maine’s norther border with Canada.\nSo far, Canadian scientists have found trace amounts of zebra mussel DNA in the St. John River but will need another year or so of study to know whether the mussels have migrated out of the lake to the north. \nStankowski said there has been no sign of the pests in Maine yet, but local wildlife officials aren’t taking any chances. The zebra mussel larvae are microscopic, meaning even well-meaning boaters wouldn’t know if they were transporting the mussels into Maine.\n“You’re not going to be able to pick them off of your boat the same you would be able to pick off a big chunk of some aquatic plant,” she said. \nThe only way to be sure, Stankowski said, was to clean the boat while it’s out of the water, then let it dry for several days before moving it into another body of water.\n“It’s really the best preventive measure that we have,” Stankowski said. \nIn the meantime, Stankowski said, officials have asked the public to volunteer to monitor bodies of water, particularly in Piscataquis and Aroostook counties, by installing what she called a “settling plate,” basically a flat plate with a handle. \n“We know that zebra mussels will attach to them if zebra mussels are in the system in that location,” she said. \nThey can be purchased for about $40 new, or volunteers can build them for roughly $35 in raw materials. Volunteers would have to place the plates, then monitor them roughly every 2-3 weeks, from May to October of this year.","length":3460,"publishedTime":"2024-03-06T14:08:00.000-05:00","rating":[8,7,7,6,8,7,6],"reason":"The article scores high in accuracy as it provides detailed and factually correct information about the zebra mussel invasion threat in northern rivers and lakes.

Source: The Catholic Weekly.","textContent":"The Productivity Commission’s draft report on philanthropy represents a major attack on Catholic and other faith-based schools, religious charities and – ultimately – on religion itself, writes Zed Seselja. Source: The Catholic Weekly.\nComing on the back of the Australian Law Reform Commission’s draft report a year earlier which Jacinta Collins, executive director of National Catholic Education Commission, said would “make it impossible for Catholic schools to be Catholic”, it appears to be part of a pattern of attacks on faith-based institutions by different arms of the Australian Government.\nThe report recommends removing tax deductibility for donations to school building funds so that donations to other areas “with greater social benefits” could be prioritised.\nIt is reminiscent of the conditions that led to the famous Goulburn school strike more than 60 years ago – governments imposing obligations on Catholic schools without properly assisting them in meeting these obligations.\nThis strike eventually led to a bi-partisan political consensus that faith-based schools should get their fair share of funding. This consensus would be undermined if the recommendation were adopted by the federal Government.\nIn addition to its attack on faith-based schools, the report also recommends the abolition of Basic Religious Charities (BRC).\nBRCs (which can include parishes and archdioceses) are a category of charity that have lower reporting and governance requirements than other charities, but also have less access to government grants and do not attract tax deductibility for the donations they receive.\nA third recommendation of the draft report would (among other things) take away tax deductibility for donations to organisations providing religious education in government schools. This would be a blow to those thousands of families, including Catholic families who greatly value having this option for their kids.\nFinally, and perhaps most concerning, the draft report recommends expanding tax deductibility for donations to most charity types, while specifically excluding charities registered under the subtype advancing religion.\nThis sends an unmistakeable message that, in the view of the Productivity Commission, religion and religious practice has little or no societal value.\nThis is a shocking misunderstanding of the nature of faith and of Australian history.\nZed Seselja was a minister in the Coalition government from 2016-2022 and now leads a specialist advisory business serving education, corporate and not-for-profit clients.\nZed Seselja: Report sees religion as having little value (The Catholic Weekly)","length":2678,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T19:40:00+00:00","rating":[2,2,3,4,4,3,2],"reason":"The article lacks accuracy as it presents a one-sided view without providing evidence or perspectives from the other side.

Reflecting on the seismic shift in work dynamics during 2020, he recalls, “When the world transitioned overnight to remote work, many found themselves inadvertently marginalized in digital meetings.” This, according to Weishaupt, marked a critical juncture in rethinking meeting structures.\nOwl Labs, under Weishaupt’s leadership, is not just responding to these challenges but is actively reshaping the narrative. “Our goal is to dismantle the ‘out of sight, out of mind’ mindset that pervades many hybrid meetings,” Weishaupt explains. To this end, Owl Labs has developed a suite of innovative hardware solutions designed to ensure remote participants are not just present but are pivotal to the meeting’s discourse.\nThese solutions pivot away from the traditional “bowling alley” setup of conference rooms, where remote participants are often just passive faces on a screen at the end of the room. Instead, Owl Labs’ technology fosters a more democratic and interactive environment. “We’re facilitating a shift from merely watching a meeting to being an active, engaged part of it, regardless of your physical location,” says Weishaupt. This transformation is achieved through state-of-the-art cameras and sound equipment that not only capture the essence of in-room interactions but also elevate the presence of remote participants, making them feel as if they are sitting at the table with their in-office colleagues.\nTechnology, while pivotal, is merely one piece of the puzzle in achieving truly effective hybrid meetings. Frank Weishaupt, CEO of Owl Labs, emphasizes that the real power lies in the intersection of technology and empathy. “The tools we create are conduits, not just for communication, but for understanding and empathy. It’s about ensuring that the person on the other side of the screen feels heard, seen, and valued,” he elucidates.\nWeishaupt’s philosophy is that technology should be a bridge, not a barrier. In this light, cultivating a culture of inclusion goes beyond merely equipping meeting spaces with high-tech gadgets. It’s about reshaping attitudes and approaches toward remote collaboration. “When we interact with remote participants through these digital interfaces, we must infuse our use of technology with the same level of consideration and attentiveness we would show if they were physically present in the room,” Weishaupt advises.\nThis cultural shift requires a holistic approach to how meetings are conducted. It involves training and guidelines that encourage active listening, equitable turn-taking, and a conscious effort to integrate remote contributions seamlessly into the conversation. “It’s about changing our meeting norms,” Weishaupt adds, “such as inviting remote participants to speak first, or having a dedicated person in the room responsible for ensuring remote voices are not only heard but also integrated into the decision-making process.”\nMoreover, this paradigm shift extends to the realm of non-verbal communication. Weishaupt notes the importance of being cognizant of body language, tone, and other subtle cues that can often be lost in virtual settings. “Empathy in this context means being more deliberate in our communication, ensuring our remote colleagues are not just part of the conversation in theory but are actively engaged and feel a genuine sense of belonging,” he explains.\nA significant challenge in adopting these technologies comes from the top. “Leadership, comfortable with traditional office interactions, often resist adopting new technologies for remote work,” Weishaupt observes. This hesitation is not just a matter of technological inertia but is deeply rooted in a pre-digital comfort zone that many leaders have long inhabited.\nThis challenge is not insignificant. Leaders who have built their careers and management styles in a face-to-face office environment may find it daunting to navigate the nuances of a digital workspace. Weishaupt elaborates, “There’s a whole repertoire of non-verbal cues and spontaneous interactions that leaders rely on in a physical office setting. The shift to hybrid models can feel like a loss of control and connection for them.”\nHowever, as the landscape of work undergoes a seismic shift, the role of leadership must evolve accordingly. “Adaptability is key,” Weishaupt urges. “Leaders must transcend their familiar paradigms and explore the potential of digital tools not just as a necessity, but as a strategic advantage.” This evolution involves embracing tools and practices that facilitate remote work, but more importantly, it requires a mindset shift.\nLeaders need to recognize that flexibility and inclusivity are not just buzzwords, but essential pillars of the modern workplace. Weishaupt suggests that leaders should start viewing remote work not as a challenge to overcome, but as an opportunity to harness a more diverse, dynamic, and adaptable workforce. “Inclusivity in this digital age means making every team member feel equally valued and heard, regardless of their physical location,” he emphasizes.\nMoreover, leaders must lead by example in embracing this new normal. “It’s about demonstrating a commitment to learning and using digital tools, showing empathy towards remote employees’ challenges, and actively fostering a culture where every voice, irrespective of how it’s transmitted, is heard and respected,” says Weishaupt.\nIn my consulting practice, I often encounter the resistance to change in hybrid work environments that Weishaupt identifies. This resistance, and associated biased thinking, presents a serious barrier to implementing effective hybrid work models.\nThe reluctance among leaders I encounter is not solely about unfamiliarity with technology, but more profoundly about a reluctance to change established workflows and communication patterns. Weishaupt accurately points out that leaders who are accustomed to face-to-face interactions often find the transition to hybrid models disconcerting. My approach in assisting companies transition to these models involves bridging the gap between traditional leadership styles and the demands of a modern, digital-first workplace. This includes conducting leadership workshops and training to demystify hybrid work models, emphasizing empathy in leadership to understand the challenges of remote employees, and showcasing success stories from other organizations that have effectively embraced hybrid models. These strategies help alleviate apprehension and demonstrate the tangible benefits of flexibility and inclusivity.\nFurthermore, an iterative approach to implementing hybrid work models allows for a gradual adaptation, making the transition smoother for both leaders and employees. Establishing robust feedback mechanisms is also crucial for continually refining the hybrid model based on regular check-ins and surveys. This comprehensive strategy aims not just to adopt hybrid work models but to ensure companies thrive in them, creating a balanced blend of traditional and innovative practices where every employee feels valued and integrated, regardless of their physical work location.\nTreating remote participants as equals in hybrid meetings is not just a technological issue but a cultural one. As businesses evolve, the successful ones will be those that embrace flexibility, inclusivity, and the technology that supports them. As Weishaupt aptly puts it, “We’re in a new era of work, and it’s time for our meeting cultures to reflect that.”\nFollow CEOWORLD magazine headlines on: Google News, LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.\nThis report/news/ranking/statistics has been prepared only for general guidance on matters of interest and does not constitute professional advice.

This condition leads to various health issues like cardiovascular diseases and Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), causing widespread disability and workforce impacts. Pathogenesis theories include persistent viral presence and immune dysregulation, but no effective treatments have been established. Research has identified risk factors such as gender and socioeconomic status, although many patients had no prior conditions. Long COVID's resemblance to other post-viral syndromes underscores the urgent need for research into its mechanisms, risk factors, and treatments to enhance patient outcomes.\nLong COVID triggers significant immune changes, particularly post-mild COVID, marked by T cell exhaustion, reduced effector memory Cluster of Differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8+ T cells, elevated Programmed Death-1 (PD1) expression, and activated innate immune responses. The scarcity of naive T and B cells, alongside sustained high type I and III interferon levels, indicates continued immune dysregulation. An altered immune cell balance, including increased non-classical monocytes, reduced dendritic cells, and low cortisol, highlights a distinct immune profile in long COVID.\nResearch points to autoimmunity in long COVID, highlighted by raised autoantibodies against key receptors like Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Viral reactivations, notably of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Human Herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), which impact mitochondrial function and energy metabolism, play a significant role. The condition's development is initially linked to inadequate immune responses, including poor antibody and T-cell response. Signs of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) persistence across multiple body tissues suggest a potential mechanism for the enduring nature of long COVID symptoms.\nSARS-CoV-2 causes widespread organ damage beyond the respiratory system, affecting the circulatory system through endothelial dysfunction and increased thrombosis risks. Long-term alterations in blood properties and vascular density contribute to the heightened prevalence of cardiovascular diseases post-COVID, demonstrating the virus's systemic and lasting effects.\nLong COVID induces neurological and cognitive issues, such as memory loss and cognitive impairment, with effects comparable to significant aging. Potential underlying mechanisms like neuroinflammation and neuronal damage link these symptoms to Alzheimer's-like pathology, highlighting severe brain impacts.\nThere is a notable overlap between long COVID and ME/CFS, with many patients meeting the criteria for the latter. This relationship underscores commonalities like immune alterations and mitochondrial dysfunction, with dysautonomia commonly co-occurring, suggesting shared pathophysiological mechanisms.\nLong COVID's reproductive effects call for focused research on sex-specific impacts, while persistent respiratory symptoms underscore lasting lung damage. These aspects illustrate the condition's broad spectrum of effects.\nPersistent gastrointestinal issues and altered gut microbiota in long COVID patients emphasize its systemic nature. The diverse onset and duration of symptoms across patients highlight the condition's complexity and the challenge of predicting individual outcomes.\nDiagnostic approaches for long COVID are under development, with existing techniques like tilt table tests and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans often failing to detect the condition effectively. Emerging diagnostics, including microclot imaging, corneal microscopy, and novel Electrocardiogram (ECG) markers, offer hope for more precise identification. Research into biomarkers and unconventional methods, such as scent detection by dogs, highlights the innovative directions being explored to improve long COVID diagnosis.\nCurrent treatment strategies for long COVID are primarily symptom-focused, with some success using methods adapted from ME/CFS management. Innovations such as low-dose naltrexone and anticoagulant therapy show promise, while experimental treatments like Paxlovid and probiotics are beginning to demonstrate potential benefits. Nonetheless, the need for rigorous clinical trials to establish effective treatments remains critical, underscoring the initial stage of long COVID care and the importance of ongoing research.\nVaccination's impact on long COVID varies, showing both minimal and reduced risk. Variants and vaccine doses may affect long COVID chances, with early studies hinting at variant-dependent risks and vaccine efficacy. Reinfections, particularly multiple ones, could heighten long COVID risks, stressing the importance of continuous research and monitoring.\nThe early pandemic's diagnostic challenges, such as limited polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test availability and high false-negative rates, led to widespread underdiagnosis, affecting mainly non-hospitalized individuals. Compounded by unreliable antibody tests, particularly among specific groups like women, children, and those with mild infections, these issues have significantly hindered long COVID research and patient care. Misclassification and study exclusion have clouded our understanding of the condition. A comprehensive approach incorporating insights from ME/CFS and dysautonomia is essential to improve long COVID research. Emphasizing clinical trials, diverse participant inclusion, and engaging patient communities, alongside updated healthcare training, will enhance patient outcomes and advance our knowledge of long COVID.Journal reference:\n\tDavis, H.E., McCorkell, L., Vogel, J.M. et al.

As a recent immigrant, these strong role models had a huge impact on my life in developing a positive mindset and a desire to thrive.\nThey provided career guidance, support and advocated for my progression. When faced with doubt or discouragement, I reminded myself of their key to success, self-belief, which was crucial for my personal and professional growth.\nHeather: I'm really inspired by what I see and hear from young women I meet.

That line could shift after June's European elections. #EuropeNews","textContent":"For years, the centre-right EPP group has drawn a red line on the eurosceptic, far right forces in the European Parliament. That line could shift after June's European elections.\n There was confidence in the air as the European People’s Party kicked off its pre-election campaign in Bucharest on Thursday. The group is projected to scoop up almost a quarter of the vote to win June’s ballot, and remain the European Parliament’s biggest faction. But with its vote share stagnating as the far right surges - and with its fellow mainstream parties in demise - questions are mounting over whether the EPP will flirt with populist partners it previously considered off-limits. Especially as its member parties have already done so in some EU capitals.Its lead candidate Ursula von der Leyen has vowed to only build bridges with pro-European, pro-NATO and pro-Ukrainian parties after the vote. For decades, the group has formed a ‘grand coalition’ with the centre and centre-left.But as voters tilt sharply to the right, the EPP is not ruling out new alliances with members of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), giving a foothold to eurosceptic forces in Brussels.The president of the ECR party, Giorgia Meloni, has rowed back on the anti-EU rhetoric that saw her elected Italy’s Prime Minister in late 2022, and has forged a close relationship with von der Leyen. Speculation is rife that members of her Fratelli d’Italia party in the European Parliament could reach an informal agreement to cooperate with the EPP in the next legislature.The Czech delegation of the ECR is also considered a moderate partner compatible with the centre-right, several EPP delegates told Euronews.“Right-wing parties are very different across the EU’s member states. We cannot put Germany’s Alternative for Germany (AfD) in the same basket as, for example, ODS in the Czech Republic, who were previously eurosceptic but are now clearly not,\" German MEP Peter Liese told Euronews.But with the likes of the notorious Finns Party, Spain’s Vox and France’s Reconquête! also belonging to the ECR, opposition groups to the left of the political spectrum are blasting their centre-right counterparts’ willingness to play footsie with hard-right conservatives.Responding to a question from Euronews, Italian foreign minister and EPP vice-president Antonio Tajani - whose centre-right Forza Italia party is in government with far-right groups - clearly expressed the EPP's willingness to form new alliances that would replace the grand coalition.\"I hope that we can work with ECR, that we can work with the liberals. We certainly cannot think that there are only socialists in the EU institutions,\" Tajani said.\"There are other forces, other realities, among them the conservatives and the liberals, so we will see what the electoral results will be,\" he went on. \"If the conservatives, as they have recently demonstrated, take the side of Europeanism, take the side of Atlanticism, we are ready to dialogue and discuss (these choices) with them.\"In capitals, far right moves into mainstreamSigns that the far right is marching into Europe’s political mainstream are not new. But whilst these have been proven overblown in previous European elections, in 2024 the threat seems real.In the Netherlands, Geert Wilders is in coalition talks after a stunning victory in last year’s national elections. Marine Le Pen’s National Rally is comfortably topping the polls in France. A new far-right challenger is upsetting the two-party dominance in Portugal. Alternative for Germany is a comfortable second in German polls, despite factions of the party being deemed extremist by the courts.Far-right or anti-European parties are predicted to come first in nine member states - including France and Italy - and second in a further nine, in June’s ballot.Mainstream conservatives in several EU member states have already transgressed the ‘sanitary cordon’ designed to keep fringe groups in check.EPP member parties are governing in a coalition or with the support of far-right or eurosceptic parties in the Czech Republic, Finland, Italy and Sweden. In a further handful of countries, including Austria, Portugal and Spain, coalition deals between the centre and far right have become commonplace at regional level.But the EPP says Europe must also be vigilant to both right- and left-wing forces on the fringes.\"Our peaceful and united Europe is being challenged like never before by populists, by nationalists, by demagogues, whether it's the far-right or the far-left,\" von der Leyen told the congress in Bucharest.But many of the EPP group's policy priorities, outlined in its electoral manifesto, suggest that the group is embracing hard-right ideologies to prevent an exodus of voters to far-right challengers.It includes a proposal to outsource asylum applications for those seeking refuge in the EU to so-called \"safe\" third countries, based on the UK-devised Rwanda model.Questioned about the legality of the idea, von der Leyen assured reporters: \"It is absolutely clear that whatever we do will be in full respect of our obligations under EU and international law,\" adding that the concept of safe third countries is already enshrined in EU law.","length":5241,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[5,6,7,6,7,6,7],"reason":"The article provides a factual overview of the current political landscape in the EU focusing on the centre-right EPP group's stance towards populist forces.

Drawings. Writings. What seemed important was to show an intimacy to their work, while also showing how impersonal it is. It may sound contradictory, but Agrest and Gandelsonas have always played with oppositional binaries. Individual-Collective. Building-City. Memory-Amnesia. Fabric-Object. Like the flip-flop reversibility of their axonometric drawings (think El Lissitzky Proun,) architecture appears as something and an inversion of that thing. They love design. They love non-design. Architecture is autonomous. Architecture relies upon the city. And so on. Maybe this is because there are two of them. With two, and is inevitable. Or perhaps their work is simply a product of its time, a collection of 1968 Pre-Post-Structuralist desires (think Barthes, Saussure, Kristeva, Lacan, etc…) brought into Architecture, ideas like Language as a Model (and Speech as a Model and Text as a Model,) Dialectical Opposition, Semiotics, Typology, Rejection of Authorship/Individualism, and so on.

Board of Education desegregation decision. Academically “gifted” children, as measured by IQ scores, became a focus of national concern. In April 1958, for instance, Life magazine warned of the “waste of fine minds” in a profile of young geniuses like the eleven-year-old Iowan with an IQ of 162 who was bored out of his mind at school—all while the Soviets were beating our pants off in the Space Race! To meet Cold War challenges, schools needed to be systematically restructured to provide for what James Bryant Conant, in his much-ballyhooed study The American High School (1959), called the “native ability” of students.In Brown, the NAACP’s lawyers presented evidence that segregated education psychologically harmed Black children. Advocates of high IQ students gave this SCOTUS-successful argument a spin of their own: the “academically talented” (the top 15 percent according to Conant) and especially the “gifted” (the top 2–3 percent) were in danger of being psychologically damaged by isolation and neglect in schools that taught to the average.With the launch of Sputnik in October 1957, all this was perceived as a matter of national security.Historian Jim Wynter Porter explores how the effort to reform high school and expand science education through the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) of 1958 meshed with white anxiety about the desegregation of schools. Advance placement, college prep, and other gifted and talented programs would turn out to be filled with students who were overwhelmingly white and wealthy—yet this was viewed as separation by “intelligence,” not segregation by race.Indeed, race went studiously unmentioned by advocates of gifted students and the testing required to identify them. After all, the race “science” and IQ testing of the 1920s and 1930s had been murderously discredited by the Nazis. Prewar obsessions over “subnormality” were replaced with postwar fascinations over “supernormality.” Intelligence was now defined as an individual, not a group or racial, trait. Any boy or girl could be an academic superstar, so schools could and should be legitimately divided by natural ability, with the top 15 percent in college prep and the rest tracked into “more appropriate” channels.The Reds, after all, had to be caught up with and overtaken in science and technology—even as American schools were reorganized to “structure inequality.”“Given the cultural biases of tests and starkly racial disparities in educational opportunity,” writes Porter, “systematic expansion of school testing could still accomplish (but now, in the name of a science race with the Soviets, one individual at a time) the work of ‘race’ without ever having to say its name.”Southern states in revolt against Brown quickly grasped the implications of IQ-based gifted programs. (Porter’s book on this topic, in press, is tellingly entitled Safeguarding Whiteness). The state of Virginia’s “massive resistance” to desegregation included closing public schools completely for years rather than integrating them. Virginia was also the first state to adopt the Educational Testing Service (ETS) National Guidance Testing Program in 1959. Georgia also pioneered another new ETS testing regime in 1960. (Porter points to the networks linking boosters like Conant and ETS, nominally a nonprofit but also a monopoly.)The “call to reorganize schools around talent” wasn’t just heard in the South. It was taken up in places where residential segregation resulted in de facto school segregation. The “discourse on ‘academic talent’ could carry ‘race’ as a stowaway within in it,” writes Porter. The reformulation of “intelligence” in the post-WWII era entangled “race and individualism and all the other social identities that individuality could subsume.” (Although outside the scope of his article, Porter suggests the same moment may have reinforced already male-dominated professions in the sciences and engineering.)Notably, Porter writes, all the concern about isolating the talented and gifted vanished as they were separated from their school mates into special classes and programs.The legacy of the Brown/Sputnik/NDEA era continues to this day, writes Porter, “with disproportionate numbers of whites and affluent students enrolled in rigorous college prepatory curricula” while other school systems are characterized by “chronic underfunding, inequitable funding, and an unhealthy, indeed extravagant overreliance on standardized tests.”\n This article appeared on JSTOR Daily, where news meets its scholarly match.","length":4683,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T16:52:31-05:00","rating":[null],"reason":"rating:","conclusion":"7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 6]\r\nreason: The article provides a historical perspective on the concept of gifted children and the impact of the Brown v.

This is a gamy picaresque for the age of the notes-app apology: a cutting novel of ego and its death, Freudian yearning, Randian Hollywood, scatological epiphany and the vileness of the pursuit of a career in letters.By the end of the first paragraph Freiman has already dropped the anvil of cancellation on her protagonist, Anna, whose aforementioned satire is panned in The New York Times as “classist.” Since the age of 3 Anna has compulsively used off-off-off-color humor to blunt life’s miseries, painting the walls of her parents’ room with feces in an attempt to massage the grief over her infant brother’s death. The joke didn’t land, but that hasn’t stopped Anna from fouling up her life ever since. “I was just trying to write humorous fiction,” she says of her voyeuristic poverty porn that loudly mocks the whole concept of trauma; “trying to bring a little slapstick to the ongoing national tragedy.”Guillotined as a “narcissist” by the paper of record, Anna finds herself lured toward the “numb leap of provocation,” tearing through the few remaining social events on her calendar hunting for trouble. After being all but removed from a clitoridectomy awareness luncheon for asserting that the clitoris is actually “privileged,” she smacks into an Ayn Rand tour paused on the sidewalk to watch a hawk tear the head off a pigeon. Anna gently asks the group what Ayn might’ve said about cancel culture; breathless, they tell her.Anna reads up on Ayn and grows “giddy with my new heresy”; like a naughty joke, Rand’s Objectivism strikes her as “true because it’s wrong.” To her best friend, Vivian, a second-and-a-half-wave feminist who considers Rand’s philosophy “something rich psychopaths use to justify their greed,” she replies that the author “thought women could do literally anything … except be the president.” At a “dissident soiree” of “centrists” in the West Village, she evangelizes Rand to two podcasters who troll the “Victim Caliphate” by making pasta for war criminals. A venture capitalist connects her with his son, a scrabbling talent manager who predicts that “cancellation was about to become cool” and who suggests she write a TV show about her new god.

As a result of the four convictions, he was additionally charged with being a habitual domestic violence offender, a class 5 felony, and sentenced to three years in prison.He has since been released.Villarruel, 52, appealed that habitual offender conviction, and persuaded a different three-judge panel of the appeals court that his second underlying convictions in 2014 wasn’t proven beyond a reasonable doubt.That court remanded the case back to the district court with orders to see if that conviction had merit, which it did.Villarruel appealed again, saying the district court should not have used transcripts from that 2014 trial, that there was insufficient evidence supporting upholding his conviction as a habitual offender, and that the court violated his Sixth Amendment rights because he couldn’t cross-examine a transcript.A new three-judge panel rejected each argument.“The prosecution offered the transcript as evidence that Villarruel pleaded guilty in (2014) to criminal mischief that included an act of domestic violence,” Judge Grant Sullivan wrote in the ruling, which was joined by Judges Stephanie Dunn and Neeti Pawar.“On appeal, the people argue that the transcript was admissible under the hearsay exception for public records and reports,” Sullivan added. “Here, however, the transcript was admitted for the limited purpose of showing that Villarruel pleaded guilty to a specific charge involving domestic violence in a previous Mesa County proceeding. The prosecution did not offer the transcript to prove the truth of any witness’s testimony.”The court also wrote that because the transcript was used for that purpose only, there was no witness to cross-examine.The court also rejected Villarruel’s argument that the court shouldn’t have re-adjudicated him as a habitual offender, saying its remand to the lower court was simply to establish if the 2014 conviction was proven and did involve domestic violence.“In his first appeal, Villarruel challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the domestic violence finding in (the 2014 conviction) only not his other two misdemeanors,” Sullivan wrote.“Agreeing with Villarruel, the (first appellate court) instructed the district court to hold further proceedings on the prior conviction … only,” he added. “Contrary to his arguments, the (previous appeal) did not wipe the slate clean by rendering his entire (habitual) adjudication a nullity.”Villarruel had been arrested in 2016 at the Mesa County Justice Center that could have led to separate assault and obstruction charges, but didn’t, when he allegedly yelled at court deputies that he was “glad” that Mesa County Deputy Derek Greer was shot to death, according to his arrest affidavit at the time.","length":3262,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[null],"reason":"rating:","conclusion":"6, 7, 3, 7, 5, 4]\r\nreason: The article provides factual information about the legal proceedings regarding the appeal of a habitual domestic violence offender designation, earning it a score of 3 for accuracy.

In its final report on Thursday, the institute revealed that audio picked up by an Al Jazeera video camera at the scene showed the reporters also came under fire from 0.50 caliber rounds of the type used by the Browning machine guns that can be mounted on Israel's Merkava tanks. \n\"It is considered a likely scenario that a Merkava tank, after firing two tank rounds, also used its machine gun against the location of the journalists,\" TNO's report said. \"The latter cannot be concluded with certainty as the direction and exact distance of (the machine gun) fire could not be established.\" \nReuters could not independently determine if the Israeli tank crew knew it was firing on journalists, nor whether it also shot at them with a machine gun and, if so, why. \nNeither of the two surviving Reuters reporters or another AFP journalist at the scene remembered the machine gun fire. All said they were in shock at the time. \nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond to requests for comment about any aspect of the attack on journalists. Asked to comment on TNO's preliminary findings in December, the IDF said: \"We don't target journalists.\" A day after the Reuters investigation was published, it said the incident took place in an active combat zone. \nInternational humanitarian law bars attacks on journalists as those in the news media have the full scope of protection granted to civilians and cannot be considered military targets. \n\"We condemn, in the strongest terms, the attack on a clearly identifiable group of journalists, working in the open. The attack killed our colleague Issam Abdallah and injured several others. We reiterate our calls on Israel to explain how this could have happened and to hold those responsible to account,\" Reuters Editor-in-Chief Alessandra Galloni said. \nAFP Global News Director Phil Chetwynd reiterated his call for a thorough and transparent investigation by the Israeli military. \n\"If reports of sustained machine gun fire are confirmed, this would add more weight to the theory this was a targeted and deliberate attack,\" he said. \nIhtisham Hibatullah, Al Jazeera's manager of international communications, urged the Israeli government to disclose the findings of its own investigation. \n\"This incident strongly indicates intentional targeting, as confirmed by investigations, including by TNO,\" he said. \nLebanon's Minister of Information did not respond to a request for comment. \nTo read the 70-page TNO report, which explains how the independent research institute in The Hague triangulated the firing point of the tank rounds and analyzed the audio of the machine gun fire, click here. \nTNO noted that the seven journalists were wearing blue flak jackets and helmets, most with \"PRESS\" written on them in white letters. They had been filming cross-border shelling from a distance in an open area on a hill near the Lebanese village of Alma al-Shaab for nearly an hour before the attack. \nVideo footage of the aftermath of the attack also showed a black car belonging to Reuters marked \"TV\" in large yellow letters made out of tape on both the hood and the roof. \nTNO said there was a clear line of sight from where the tank rounds were fired to the scene of the attack. In the live TV feeds ahead of the attack, one or more drones can be heard and an Israeli helicopter was also visible overhead in some footage. \nThe institute was able to determine exactly where the two tank rounds came from because it had video of the second round's muzzle blast and flight, in addition to audio files recorded at the scene of the incident. \nTNO's analysis of the machine gun fire showed that the \"only reasonable match\" was for a 0.50 caliber weapon fired from 1.34 km away - the same distance as the tank rounds - but the audio recordings were not sufficient to determine the firing point. \nHowever, the fact the bursts of bullets came so quickly after the tank rounds, coupled with the analysis, led TNO to conclude it was \"likely\" they came from the same place. The independent institute did not offer any other scenario for the origin of the machine gun fire. \nAbout 30 seconds after the second tank round, there was a burst of some 25 shots from a machine gun, followed by bursts of nine and 12 shots. Just over 30 seconds later, there were three shots, then a single shot and a metallic ping, which may have been the bullet hitting a low wall near the camera, TNO said. \nReuters photographer Thaier Al-Sudani, 47 cameraman Maher Nazeh, 53, as well as two journalists from Al Jazeera and another from AFP were also wounded in the attack. \nSeveral of the experts who reviewed the TNO report at the request of Reuters expressed divergent views about whether the tank crew had deliberately targeted journalists. \n\"The TNO report does conclude that it was likely, in addition to the two tank rounds, that machine gun fire came from the same location, and that adds to, or compounds the, deliberateness with which they seem to have been targeted, directly,\" said Jessica Dorsey, an expert in international humanitarian law at Utrecht University. \n\"And I think that that, from a legal perspective, if this ever got to a courtroom, makes even more of a compelling argument that this was indeed a war crime,\" she said. \nHowever, Nick Kaufman, a British-Israeli lawyer who served in the IDF Military Advocate General's Corps and has defended high-profile clients against war crime charges at international criminal tribunals, said it was still unclear why the tank had fired on the reporters. \n\"On the basis of the TNO report alone, it's not possible to conclude that this was intentional targeting of journalists as opposed to the pursuit of a legitimate military objective which went awry,\" he said. \"One would need to have a full inquiry and understand the military intelligence which underlay the deployment of the two rounds.\" \nThe day after the attack, Israel's military said it had visuals of the incident and it was being investigated. No results have been made public.","length":7010,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,8,7,9,7,7],"reason":"The article provides a thorough and detailed account of the incident where a Reuters reporter was killed in Lebanon.

Europe too is moving in this area and crackdowns move around the world.\nThe US trade watchdog has decided that browsing and location data should be considered sensitive, and that – despite the absence of allegations about personally identifiable information (PII) within the datasets of the above businesses – what makes this stuff sensitive is what can be inferred from it.\n\"Years of research shows that datasets often contain sensitive and personally identifiable information even when they do not contain any traditional standalone elements of PII, and re-identification gets easier every day – especially for datasets with the precision of those at issue in the FTC's proposed complaints against Avast, X-Mode, and InMarket,\" the commission declared.\nTwo weeks ago, the agency resolved its complaint against security vendor Avast for $16.5 million based on allegations that the firm used a \"a unique and persistent device identifier\" with its Jumpshot analytics business to track internet users' activities – including \"each webpage visited, precise timestamp, the type of device and browser, and the city, state, and country.\"\nDespite the crackdown, data brokers continue to sell advertising data that threatens people's privacy.\nMeanwhile, in Europe last week, privacy activist organization Open Rights Group filed legal complaints with data protection authorities in the UK and in France challenging data broker LiveRamp's \"pervasive identity surveillance for marketing purposes.\" The org has asked data protection authorities to review LiveRamp's practices under Europe's GDPR and UK data protection legislation.\nLiveRamp, when it was known as Acxiom, was one of the three data brokers that \"openly and explicitly advertise data on current or former US military personnel,\" according to a 2021 report from the Cyber Policy Program at Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy.\nEven while helping to target visitors to Planned Parenthood with anti-abortion ads, selling data on US citizens to foreign companies, or selling data on US military personnel, these firms claim they don't sell personal information.\nNonetheless, data brokers – with the help of technology platforms like Apple and Google that provide location data – implement identifiers that can be used to infer personal information.\n\"The ad tech industry has been clinging to an unsustainable, narrow interpretation of what constitutes personal information,\" Arielle Garcia, privacy consultant with ASG Solutions, told The Register. \"Given that this data is used to target, track, and profile consumers, there is a fundamental incompatibility between the use of identifiers and the concept of de-identification.\n\"Once someone interacts with an ad, for example, the alleged 'deidentification' is null and void. For example, one could purchase an audience segment of individuals likely seeking treatment for an illness, advertise to them, and have the ad drive traffic to a landing page (which [also contains a tracking pixel]), and a form where they are prompted to enter their name, and other personal information.\"\nA report accompanying the Open Rights Group complaints looks at LiveRamp's identity graph system which, according to Wolfie Christl, a security researcher at Cracked Labs and report co-author, includes identity records on 250 million people in the US, 45 million in the UK and 25 million in France.\n\"It assigns everyone a unique personal identifier, the 'RampID', which is tied to their name, home address, previous addresses, email, phone numbers, device IDs (referring to their smartphones, tablets, TVs, browsers etc), account IDs at large platforms and IDs referring to digital profiles stored by other data brokers,\" wrote Christl in a post to LinkedIn.\nRampID, the report alleges, allows businesses \"to recognize, track, follow, profile and target people across the digital world.\" It further states that until recently \"the terminology used by LiveRamp was misleading or could even be considered as deceptive,\" because it referred to RampID as an anonymous identifier. Presently, the company calls RampID a pseudonymous identifier – which is counted as personal data under GDPR, according to the report.\n\"Pseudonymous identifiers are identifiers, such as known identifiers that have been pseudonymized or device identifiers (such as a mobile device ID or cookie ID), that can't be directly tied back to an individual,\" LiveRamp's documentation states.\nBill Budington, senior staff technologist for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, argues otherwise.\n\"Ad IDs provide a specific persistent identifier over multiple data points, so any data broker with a set of Ad IDs and location points can 'connect the dots' and trace an individual's movement over time,\" Budington told The Register. \"Using that location data, further inferences can be made as to a person's home address, their workplace, who they have romantic relationships with, where they go after hours, etc.\n\"Any effort at anonymizing data has to adhere to rigorous standards,\" Budington added. \"Just removing traditional identifiers such as name or SSN from a dataset isn't nearly enough. In fact, unique IDs which are assigned to an individual may be more identifying than a person's name.\"\n\"In combination, data sets that are linked with a device can be incredibly revealing and identifiable to a person, leading to pinpointing their location over time, sensitive locations they may have visited, and behavioral habits associated with location over time.\"\nEU-turn! Now Apple says it won't banish Home Screen web apps in Europe\nCops visit school of 'wrong person's child,' mix up victims and suspects in epic data fail\nWhite House goes to court, not Congress, to renew warrantless spy powers\nApple and Google implement a mobile advertising identifier, which is intended to be unique, user-resettable, and user-deletable, and can be used for geo-targeted marketing.\nTechnically non-persistent and notionally pseudonymous, these ad identifiers don't provide direct access to user profiles. But they can be linked to data profiles and can be used to target mobile devices with personalized ads based on location data.\nAd firms may or may not consider mobile IDs to be PII – depending on whether they can be used to identify the device user. Google's definition of PII, for example, is situational.\nThe ad giant doesn't consider pseudonymous cookie IDs, pseudonymous advertising IDs, IP addresses, or other pseudonymous end user identifiers to be PII for the purposes of its contracts and policies – even though laws in Europe, the UK, and the US may have different definitions that may apply and those definitions leave room for interpretation.\nRyan Paterson, president of privacy-focused mobile phone biz Unplugged, told The Register that he could approach a data broker and ask for all the advertising IDs in several geo-bounded regions – like the areas around a specific house, a school, and a restaurant – over a period of time.\nArmed with this data, an individual or organization can build a map of a particular ad identifier's movements, which can often be used to identify the person using the device. If, for example, a particular identifier is often at a particular house in the evening, it's probably associated with that household. And if it also shows up often at a particular place of business during work hours, that person is probably employed there.\nPaterson provided The Register with an example map of location data over time, using dummy data so as not to harm anyone's privacy.\nScreenshot from Google Earth Pro showing location data – Click to enlarge\nZach Edwards, security and privacy consultant with privacy research house Victory Medium, told The Register that while Apple and Google allow people to disable their advertising IDs, most people don't do that.\nMobile advertising IDs, he explained, apply to native iOS and Android apps – but not websites, which historically have involved different identifiers like HTTP cookies and IP addresses. But these often get combined.\n\"The IP address is often the join key,\" Edwards explained. \"You have an IP address and an advertising ID on the mobile app side. On the website side or in-app browser side, you have lots of basically IP addresses. With in-app browsers, you also sometimes have the advertising ID [because the in-app browser exists within a native app]. Certain entities can buy lots of data appended to data that they have, and then really develop robust profiles for people. That's how a lot of the advertising segments are built. All the data brokers are exchanging data and building the best profiles they can.\"\nEdwards also observed that there are advertising IDs beyond those offered by Apple and Google. Connected TV – content streaming through apps on smart TVs and set-top boxes – also comes with advertising identifiers.\n\"Apple and Google are the only two companies that have even a remote level of control and transparency around this,\" he noted. \"The Tizen IDs and all these other TV IDs, these are on by default, hard to find how to turn it off, and the user is never prompted to turn it off. And that's becoming a bigger problem when every TV you can buy is like a big Android device.\"\nFurther compounding the problem, Edwards continued, is the fact that it's not obvious what the SDKs built into apps do with the data they handle.\n\"Neither Google nor Apple requires disclosure of SDK company names,\" explained Edwards. \"So before you download an app, you may know what the permissions are. You may see their privacy label, but you don't know who their partners are.\"\nIt used to be that relatively few people knew how to exploit data effectively for identification and targeting. But now, once obscure gray-hat marketing techniques have become standard practice.\nA decade ago, said Edwards, \"only the highest level of government people were using ads for targeting people, serving malware to one person, like real pure fuckery on the ad networks. But now, there are large numbers of data brokers whose core offering is to track people as a service.\n\"We've basically crossed the Rubicon where every data scientist with even a little bit of experience with location data has in some way seen or is aware of these types of invasive practices.\" ®\nIn a statement to The Register after this story was published, a LiveRamp spokesperson told us:","length":10851,"publishedTime":"2024-03-05T08:28:05Z","rating":[null],"reason":"rating:","conclusion":"7, 7, 9, 8, 8, 7]\r\nreason: \r\n- Accuracy: The article provides detailed and accurate information regarding the recent enforcement actions by the US Federal Trade Commission and Europe on data brokers like Avast, X-Mode, and InMarket.

Better than well, in fact – the 25-year-old Dutchman was feeling “exceptionally good” in the early kilometres of the French one-day race, describing it later as one of his best days ever on the bike.But with around 100 km to go, with Van den Berg well-positioned ahead of an important descent, things suddenly took a turn for the worse. “Suddenly I got a strange feeling in my legs and my head also became very light,” Van den Berg said this week on his podcast, Cycling Inside. “I felt bad and put my hand in the air to drop through the peloton, because I wanted to stop.”Moments later, Van den Berg collided with a rider on his left and then, without warning, the lights went out.“It went black before my eyes,” he said. “Just before I fell, I panicked and thought: ‘This is really going wrong.’”Van den Berg lost consciousness while still on the bike, and crashed at somewhere between 35 and 40 km/h. When he came to, moments later, he was surrounded.“Before you know it, you wake up and there are 10 people above you, watching you,” he said. “That was quite a shock.”Among those to stop was Van den Berg’s compatriot and former teammate at the Metec-TKH Continental team, Sjoerd Bax (now with UAE Team Emirates).“He stopped, he saw that something was wrong,” Van den Berg said. “He waited until the race doctor was there. I saw him on Sunday and thanked him, because not everyone does that for you.”While Van den Berg didn’t suffer any serious injuries in his fall – “I came away with a few scrapes, but that was the only thing” – he knew something wasn’t right. “I lay on the floor in a panic and felt terribly bad throughout my body,” he said on Cycling Inside. “Then it finally dawned on me and I was taken by ambulance to the hospital.”There, Van den Berg underwent an ECG and a heart ultrasound, but there was no sign of anything abnormal. After a long day in hospital, Van den Berg was discharged at around 11:30pm and taken back to the team hotel. He’d been due to start the Faun Drôme Classic the following day but, understandably, sat the race out. There was talk of Van den Berg undergoing further tests in France but ultimately he came home to the Netherlands on Tuesday and went straight to hospital in Amsterdam. He underwent further investigation and has since been “constantly monitored by the cardiologists”.At this point, though, the 25-year-old still doesn’t have any concrete answers about what happened.“We are busy trying to find out what it is,” he said. “It looks like there will be a definitive answer in the short term. I don’t have an answer yet.“You would think that you felt bad all day or that you felt it coming, but it was one of my best days on the bike. That you suddenly become unwell makes it all the more confusing.”Understandably, Van den Berg isn’t in a rush to get back to racing right now. But he’s certain he will be back, when it’s safe to do so.“I am positive that I will return,” he said. “Health now comes first. You want to be 110% fit again before you participate in top sport again. I feel a lot of support from family and team and will come back stronger.”What did you think of this story?Lars van den Berg","length":3342,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T22:46:41+00:00","rating":[8,9,7,6,8,8,7],"reason":"The article provides factual information about Lars van den Berg's scary crash during the Faun-Ardèche Classic race, detailing his sudden loss of consciousness while on the bike, the aftermath of the crash, and his medical evaluations.

In  2021, a dangerous cyclist who jumped a red light and killed a 72-year-old pensioner was jailed for two years for his irresponsibly driving.   The threat posed by aggressive cyclists is becoming a growing concern for people in recent years. A poll of over 2,000 motorists in 2023 found that 60 per cent believed aggressive cyclists are a bigger threat than three years ago. A further 61 per cent of respondents would not support a law assuming drivers are always responsible for collisions with cyclists or pedestrians in urban areas. The director of policy and research at the IAM RoadSmart charity stressed there was 'no quick-fix' to the 'daily conflicts' between motorists and cyclists.Neil Greig said: 'The Government has introduced a range of laws in recent years in an effort to fix the daily conflicts we see between motorists and cyclists.'However, if our research is anything to go by, this has largely been to no avail, with the majority of respondents still reporting aggression and conflict among road users.'There is no quick-fix to this issue, but our research sheds light on the urgent need for the Government to maintain its education campaigns on the new Highway Code, and continue to invest in safe road markings for more vulnerable road users to minimise the chance of conflict wherever possible.

And do they fit in the culture of the organization? If they fail on either one, you're going to be in trouble.\"Culture is more important than raw talent, Cuban said. Most of the workforce agrees: 56% of workers rank a strong workplace culture as more important than salary, with more than 75% of employees saying they'd consider a company's culture before applying for a job there, according to a 2019 Glassdoor survey of more than 5,000 adults in the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany.Young millennials and Gen Zers consider company culture a particular priority, the Glassdoor report noted — meaning Cuban's observation many prove more true over time, as those workers increasingly rise through the ranks.Cuban does value employees who complete tasks correctly and efficiently — that's the competency part. But searching for the perfect worker to fix your company's problems, a \"home run hire,\" without properly vetting their cultural fit is \"probably the biggest mistake I've seen my portfolio companies [make],\" he said.To find employees who check both boxes, Cuban said he asks specific job interview questions like:What's one thing you've failed at and one thing you've succeeded at?Tell me about a time you took a chance at work.Why did you leave your last job?What's the best culture of a company that you've ever worked in?Who's the best manager you've ever worked for?\"I want to get them talking about their positive or negative experiences, so I can understand whether or not they're going to be a fit,\" he said.For Cuban, the right fit doesn't mean a carbon copy of himself: He looks for employees and partners who \"complement\" his skill set, but are unafraid to speak up when they disagree with him, he noted.\"I think one of the biggest problems an entrepreneur [or] CEO can make is they hire people who are like them,\" Cuban said. \"You don't need to hire people like you. You've got you.\"\"I don't need people to tell me yes,\" he added. \"I can tell myself yes ...

both her constituents and the House of Commons will miss her.

(CJ Smith/The Battalion) \n With 16:57 left, it looked Like Texas A&M men’s basketball would be easily on its way to winning its second-straight game, as the Aggies grabbed a 23-point lead with a graduate G Tyrece Radford and-1.\nThe Bulldogs went on a 33-13 run over the next 12:55 minutes, cutting the once-comfortable A&M lead to just 3 with 2:21 left, with the potential to catastrophically end any chance the Maroon and White had at postseason play.\n“The house was on fire,” Radford said. “Like, ‘What’s going on? How do we put this out?’ Because when the team is coming down just scoring, and we’re not scoring, it’s an emergency. We’ve got to find out how to put that fire out.”\nJunior G Manny Obaseki gave the Aggies a momentary two-possession lead the following possession, but the Bulldogs cut it back to 3 with a quick dump-off dunk to senior forward Cameron Matthews.\nWith the clock winding down the next possession, junior G Wade Taylor IV — who was 3-7 from beyond the arc — put up a 3 that clanked off the front iron. However, sophomore F Solomon Washington grabbed his third and most important board for the Aggies, getting the ball back to Taylor who then hit a runner off the backboard to push the lead to 5.\n“I get yelled at when I don’t go rebound,” Washington said. “So, I didn’t want to get yelled at and coach Buzz was looking at me with that little stare. So yeah, I had to grab that one.”\nThen freshman Bulldogs G Josh Hubbard brought the ball to the top of the key, pulled up and missed, with Washington grabbing another board to all but seal the Aggies’ victory on Senior Night.\nA&M ends its home schedule, and Tyrece Radford’s last game at home, on a high note\nIt’s hard to match what the Aggies did at home last season, only giving up one home loss in an upset to Wofford with wins over Tennessee, Auburn and Alabama to cap off a historic season.\nDespite the dropoff this year with home losses to Memphis, LSU and Arkansas, A&M finished off its last game at Reed Arena on a high note against the Bulldogs. With the win, the Maroon and White finish the year with big wins over Kentucky, Tennessee, Florida and now Mississippi State at home.\nArguably for Aggies fans, this win means more in regards to getting one player a final victory in College Station in Radford.\nAfter Buzz Williams left Virginia Tech for A&M, Radford, who followed Williams, has been a staple in the Aggies’ starting lineup, averaging over 30 minutes a game since arriving in College Station.\nThe Baton Rouge, Louisiana native has provided A&M with veteran experience and tough guard play, hence the nickname, “Boots.” Poetically, the win over the Bulldogs was Radford’s 100th game as an Aggie.\nNo matter what happens the rest of the season, Radford has been a consistent figure that has helped lead A&M to an NIT final and an NCAA tournament berth. Aggie fans will have to get used to not seeing him in Reed Arena come next year.\n [My final home game] was amazing. I’m still kind of soaking it in, thinking that it’s really my last game here. All of the feelings haven’t hit me yet.”\nAll season, the list of names on A&M’s offensive scouting report has been short: Radford and Taylor.\nThis has led to multiple feast or famine situations for the Aggies all year, as when the backcourt duo is clicking, they can be a nigh-unstoppable force. But when they’re off, it can spell doom.\nAgainst the Bulldogs, Obaseki and Washington provided big minutes and big buckets for the Aggies, taking weight off of the star’s shoulders.\nObaseki, who started just his second game this season, led all A&M scorers with 17, only his second time hitting double digits in conference play.\nWashington on the other hand was a force both scoring and on the glass, racking up 15 points to go along with nine rebounds.\nWith the most crucial stretch of games the Aggies have faced up ahead, they need all the help they can get from everyone involved. If A&M can get two more consistent scorers to compliment Radford and Taylor, the Maroon and White could end up making things interesting.\nThe conversation between A&M and the NCAA tournament may seem ludicrous to some, but it’s not completely out of question with the win over Mississippi State.\nThe Aggies, now at 17-13, still have a front-loaded resume with Quad-1 wins over teams like Iowa State, Kentucky and Tennessee. Now, A&M has another win over a projected tournament team after taking down the Bulldogs.\nThe win over Mississippi State is a Quad-2 win, giving the Maroon and White 10 Quad-1 and 2 victories. The Aggies get another opportunity to grab another quality win this weekend on the road against Ole Miss before the SEC tournament.\nFor A&M, it seems like the magic number is 20. Finishing the season 5-0, with multiple Quad-2 and potential Quad-1 wins, would put the Maroon and White at 20-13 with one of the better resumes in the country, excluding the collection of ugly Quad-3 losses that are the reason A&M is not being considered in the tournament right now.\nIt’s a long shot, but for Aggie fans, there’s still hope yet. It’s March. Anything can happen.\n\t\tYour donation will support the student journalists of Texas A&M University - College Station.

Lefty bottom: Explore chief executive Jenny Layfield (Image: Supplied)COUNCIL bosses in York have been challenged to say exactly where they expect library cuts to fall - and whether library staff will be made redundant - after the authority approved a £300,000 cut in the Explore York budget in each of the next two years.Explore, the city’s independently-run library service, operates 15 libraries and the city archives under a 15-year funding contract with the council.The Labour-run authority approved a budget last week which would see the library service’s annual council funding cut from £2.6 million to £2.3 million in the year beginning in April – and then to £2 million the year after.Opposition Liberal Democrat councillors - who voted against the cuts to library funding - today demanded to know which areas of the city library service the council now expected to see cut.Cllr Darryl Smalley, who was executive member responsible for libraries under the previous Lib Dem/ Green administration, said: “Under the Liberal Democrats, funding for York’s libraries was protected every single year. It’s shameful that Labour’s first act is to cut their budget.York Press: Cllr Darryl SmalleyCllr Darryl Smalley (Image: Supplied)“We now must have urgent answers from the Labour administration about exactly which libraries services will be cut, which staff are going to be made redundant and if we will see the closure of any libraries.”Cllr Smalley said his party had ‘put forward a simple amendment to stop the cut to our libraries’ at last week’s budget.The plan would have involved using £1.5 million of extra government cash earmarked for the council by Whitehall just before the budget was set, Cllr Smalley said.Explore chief executive Jenny Layfield, who spoke against the cuts at last week’s meeting, said she was ‘disappointed’ they had been voted through and that a way could not have been found to protect libraries.She said her organisation’s board of directors would meet with council representatives to discuss changes to the funding contract – but only after the authority has issued a notice clarifying exactly what library services it thinks should be cut.York Press: Explore York chief executive Jenny LayfieldExplore York chief executive Jenny Layfield (Image: Supplied)She said: “Initially they need to issue us with a change clause notice stating what services they want us to reduce. We will then enter in discussions with them in good faith as we have stated all along.”She said the council would also, at some point, need to consult on proposed library cuts.Ms Layfield said she would ‘continue to campaign for our Libraries and the communities who use them’ but added: “I appreciate the challenges that the City of York Council is facing and that, in the current climate, there are no easy choices to be made.”Pauline Stuchfield, the director of customer and communities at City of York Council, said: “The council will continue to monitor and review all aspects of Explore York’s business and financial information, within its client remit and responsibilities, before and after issuing a contract change notice, and during the necessary following negotiations that will take place.\"We are committed to a partnership approach between the two parties aimed at ensuring York’s libraries continue to flourish long into the future. The council will honour its contractual obligations until any changes are made”.","length":3512,"publishedTime":"2024-02-28T12:10:31.000Z","rating":[5,6,7,4,6,5,4],"reason":"The article provides a comprehensive overview of the situation regarding library cuts in York.

The musician has come to represent many things: the second coming of Manhattan’s pre-millennial-pink “indie sleaze” heyday; the type of debauched, lip-biting horniness that provokes both QAnon death threats and finger-wagging Pitchfork reviews; the nihilistic urgency of post-quarantine hedonism. But when you go beyond the discourse, when you get offline and into the club, he’s simply a guy in a Gucci suit who can throw and soundtrack a really fun party. So naturally, when I heard Harrison Patrick Smith was holding his Freakquencies party at the newly-opened New York outpost of Silencio (“the Chicest Club in Paris,” according to Vogue), I volunteered coverage and hightailed it to my nearest thrift store in search of a vintage teddy to mutilate with scissors and safety pins. I hadn’t been to Freakquencies since the early days, during the year after “Girls” came out—when I spent my Wednesday nights at Old Flings’s We Take Manhattan party and my Thursday nights at Home Sweet Home on Chrystie, downing whiskey gingers and stumbling over Kevin Carpet in the bathroom line—and I was excited to see the nightlife industry’s latest attempt to make midtown happen. Silencio NYC’s numerous glowing writeups, fuzzy red interiors, and associations with David Lynch and Studio 54 were promising enough that I didn’t mind taking three trains from Bushwick in 30-degree weather. I came away from the night with two major conclusions: The first is that Freakquencies is Freakquencies in any venue; whether you’re in the Lower East Side or the upper reaches of Hell’s Kitchen, the music is good and the crowd energetic, eager, and dancey. The second is that downtown’s reign over Manhattan nightlife is safe. I brought along a couple of disposable cameras and handed one to the Dare to capture the party from his perspective. Read ahead for my diary of the night and photos by the Dare, myself, and other attendees.7:33 PM: Naptime. Going out during the week is a lot easier when you don’t go into the office.9:47 PM: Successfully got out of bed and into my new party “dress.” Wanted to go shorter, so I cut it while it was still on my body. Super uneven; I won’t do that again. 10:50 PM: Began the hour-long journey uptown with my roommate/DJ partner/ride-or-die Sarah. At some point in the mustard glow of the N train, I microdose. This is my trick for when I party and I have work the next day—no hangover and it gives me enough energy to dance. 11:39 PM: We spot the line in front of an unassuming door. The median age looks to be about 21 and a half, and the bouncer is confiscating a fake. Sarah and I don’t recognize anyone. The bouncer is shocked and complimentary when he checks my ID—I am both flattered, embarrassed, and a little annoyed that there has never, and probably will never be, a time in my life when my age is simply a neutral fact. 11:45 PM: Behind the door is a covered stairway leading down a narrow alleyway lit with strands of red LED lights. Coat check is outside at the end of the alley and is cash only. Two girls in front of me ask if they can Venmo me for $10, but there’s no service. They promise to Venmo me when later in the night, and I give them the money. I need the karma! Courtesy of Maraya Fisher11:55 PM: We enter Silencio. It’s striking at first—the red velveteen walls lined with the same LED lights as outside and the disorienting feeling of carpet under my kitten heels. The room is pretty small, a rectangle with a red velvet-curtained cutout nook on each of the two long sides, one behind a large DJ booth. Thoom is DJing fun 2000s classics like Yelle’s “Je veux te voir” and “Hung Up” by Madonna.12:07 AM: After a quick lap, Sarah and I peek behind a curtain, step up into the alcove, and find a few spindly bistro tables, one of which has bottle service. The walls in this area are padded and covered in gold vinyl that stretches over deep bench seating. In one corner, three girlies take advantage of the metallic backdrop with a quick photoshoot. Harrison is in the opposite corner with a few friends. I give him a disposable camera, we make a few comments about the space, and he is promptly swept away into another conversation. 12:11 AM: Sarah and I introduce ourselves to the girls in the corner. One says the club is giving fashion pop-up, and now I can’t unsee it. The design and concept by Harry Nuriev are excellent, but the execution makes the space feel oddly temporary. The alcove walls are hollow and feel like a set, and one has strips of black masking tape to cover a power cable. Drinks are served in plastic cups, and there’s a visible outline of brick under the carpet. I can’t help but wonder how long it will stay that pristine with all the fluids that end up on nightclub floors. None of this is all that bad; it just undermines the air of exclusive luxury promised by the hype. 12:31 AM: Jackson Walker Lewis is on the decks, and the set is starting to hit hard. There’s a fair amount of acid house, and he plays “Mothers,” the debut single from his project Fcukers. Sarah and I run into our friends Serge Neborak, founder and creative director of Drink More Water, and Angelina Hazzouri. 1:06 AM: the Dare is DJing “ADD SUV” by Uffie and the place is going nuts. Sarah and I end up packed against strangers in the alcove behind the booth. I see my boyfriend Avi Henig in the packed crowd, and a benevolent photographer pulls him onto the platform (karma, is that you?) The mood is pretty euphoric, and there is a line of girls and more photographers pressed against the DJ booth.1:36 AM: the Dare plays the new Charli XCX single “Von Dutch” that’s been teased on TikTok. The people love it. 2:14 AM: A man who looks like he’s there alone asks us if we have coke and lingers after we say no. Why is there always one of these??Courtesy of Maraya Fisher2:23 AM: Avi and I step into the alley for a cigarette. While we’re outside, we hear a chorus of girls scream, which can only mean one thing: the Dare is playing the song that started it all. I catch producer Cahtayah and artist Valley Latini on their way out. 2:47 AM: The crowd has thinned. The carpet is littered with shooters, along with a lone, abandoned shoe insole. There is still a large group around the booth, however. I collect the disposable from the Dare, who honestly looks like he could go on DJing for another four hours or so. Avi, Sarah, and I agree to spend the $15 each on an Uber back to Brooklyn.","length":6569,"publishedTime":"2024-03-06T22:10:03Z","rating":[8,7,6,7,8,7,8],"reason":"- Accuracy: The article accurately describes the atmosphere, the venue, and the events of the party, providing a detailed account of the experience without factual inaccuracies.\r\n  - Objectivity: The article maintains a balance between personal experiences and objective descriptions of the party, attendees, and music.\r\n  - Clarity and Coherence: The article is well-structured, describing the events of the party chronologically, making it easy for the readers to follow.\r\n  - Depth of Analysis: The article provides a thorough analysis of the party, offering insights into the music, venue, crowd, and overall experience.\r\n  - Language and Presentation: The language used is engaging, lively, and descriptive, enhancing the reader's experience.\r\n  - Readability: The article is written in a way that is easy to read and comprehend, with a good balance of sentence structure and vocabulary complexity.\r\n  - Attractive: The writing style is captivating, engaging the readers with vivid descriptions and personal experiences.","conclusion":"1"},{"lang":"en","siteName":"TREND HUNTER Inc.","link":"https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/the-skinny-confidential","title":"Pre-Shower Body Brushes","byline":"Kanesa David","excerpt":"the skinny confidential - The Skinny Confidential has unveiled its latest innovation: The Butter Brush, available for $79.

But what if the emotions are huge from the get-go?That’s the challenge and, it turns out, the glory of “Illinoise,” a mysterious and deeply moving dance-musical hybrid based on Sufjan Stevens’s similarly named 2005 concept album. (The title has acquired an extra “e.”) Exploring the hot zone between childhood and adulthood, when emotions can be at their most overwhelming, the show dispenses with dialogue completely and leaps directly to movement and song.But not together: Among a thousand other smart choices, Justin Peck (who directed and choreographed) and Jackie Sibblies Drury (who, with Peck, wrote the story) have delaminated the songs from the characters, thus avoiding the jukebox trap that diminishes both.Instead, in the show, which opened on Thursday at the Park Avenue Armory, Stevens’s wistful and sometimes enigmatic numbers, set in various Illinois locations, are performed by three vocalists on platforms high above the action, wearing butterfly wings as if to stay aloft. Below, the 12 acting dancers (or are they dancing actors?) perform a parallel story without being forced into overliteral connections.Or rather, they perform an anthology of stories, a kind of exquisite corpse of late adolescence. As they collect around a clump of lanterns that suggest an urban campfire — the poetic set, including upside-down trees, is by Adam Rigg — they engage in what seems to be a rite of passage: the sharing of deep truths with sympathetic friends. The truths are often traumas, of course: first love, first loss, first disillusionment, first death. They are “read” (that is, danced) from notebooks decorated, again, with butterflies, suggesting the privacy of cocoons and the fragility of emergence.ImageTwelve acting dancers (or are they dancing actors?) perform a story that’s parallel to the one told in Sufjan Stevens’s wistful songs set in various Illinois locations.Credit...Sara Krulwich/The New York TimesThank you for your patience while we verify access.

(Photo: Latest Sightings/YouTube)A video of wild dogs trying to free their \"brother\" from the clutches of a lion has surfaced online. The scene was captured by Nhlanhla Nkuna, a guide at Balule Nature Reserve in South Africa. Nhlanhla recorded a video of the scene and shared it with Latest Sightings, who further posted it on their YouTube channel in the previous week. Narrating the incident, Nhlanhla said, “We found a huge lion that was relaxing in the shade of some shrubs when something caught his attention. A steenbok! He jumped up, but before realising what was happening, the little buck had disappeared into the bushes.”Witnessing the scene, Nhlanhla wondered why the steenbok had fled. Soon, the answer became apparent as a pack of wild dogs emerged, sprinting full speed in pursuit of their prey. The pack of wild dogs were unaware as danger lurked nearby as the lion lay concealed in the bushes. As the first wild dog appeared, the lion swiftly pounced, catching it off guard and seizing it by the throat. \"The wild dog let out a squeal and a whimper. He was caught, and there was no way he could do anything about it,” Nhlanhla said. The other two members of the wild dog pack, upon hearing the distress calls, rushed to the scene. Faced with the grim reality that one of their own was captured, they resorted to intimidation, barking and growling at the imposing lion. Despite their efforts, the lion remained unfazed, maintaining a firm grip on the captured wild dog.“The huge male, who knew that the dogs could not harm him, just kept his grip firm on the wild dog’s throat. At that point, the wild dog gave his last kick, and a small whimper of its last breath came out, and his life came to an end. The other dogs, clearly defeated, just stood and watched on,” Nhlanhla added.Watch the video here: The video garnered over 2 million views while wildlife enthusiasts expressed their opinions in the comments section of the post.\"The way he just grabbed him with one paw. This lion is such a force,\" a user commented. \"I'm shocked that the wild dogs didn't at least attempt to nip the lion. They were so scared to get near him,\" another user said. \"The expression on the lion's face is classic,\" another person said.

Based on the Bethesda video game franchise, Prime Video's adaptation is set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland ravaged by nuclear war where some survivors have taken refuge in fallout bunkers known as Vaults. The Fallout TV show cast includes Ella Purnell, Walton Goggins, Aaron Moten, Kyle MacLachlan, Moisés Arias, Johnny Pemberton, Dale Dickey, and Michael Emerson.\nDuring a press conference that Screen Rant attended, held after the release of the new Fallout trailer, Nolan, Wagner, and Robertson-Dworet detailed how key elements from the games were adapted into live-action. The show's developer and co-creators discussed everything from the Power armor, tone, scope, production design, themes, and factions. Read their full comments below:\n: We talked a lot about the Power Armor. The tone was a big thing. I think the tone was maybe the most challenging and the most intimidating thing for me. But working with Geneva and Graham, you knew that we were going to be in a really good place with that incredibly ambitious story. On a technical level, the scope of the world and the Power Armor in particular was one of those things you go, \"Oh, how on Earth are we going to do that?\" But we got there.\n: This is a small thing. But if you saw in the trailer, Chet, who gets splattered in blood, they got the Brylcreem just right. I know that's not as ambitious as the Power Armor, but when they got the Brylcreem in his hair just right, I was like, \"Nailed it.\" I guess we could have done that on a smaller show. [laugh] That's the kind of thing I'm keeping my eye out for.\n: Oh, God, it was everything. And we couldn't be more grateful to our incredible production designer, Howard Cummings, who just poured his whole soul into this. Truly, arriving on set every day was like Christmas morning. That I think is something that Jonah has brought to all of his projects is just this incredible eye for meticulous detail. Every detail has to be perfect, and so much of it, we made physically. It's not just effects. So, I was really just grateful for that.\nI think it's not just the incredible tone, which is, as people have talked about, this unbelievable blend of action and comedy and just weirdness. But I think it's these incredibly prescient themes, factionalism, being maybe the most obvious. When you play the game Fallout, you go from settlement to settlement or from faction to faction. And that was something that we were really excited to manifest with our heroes. You know, Ella being the Vault Dweller, Aaron being the Brotherhood of Steel member, and Walton being sort of the character that nobody really cares about, the Ghouls in the wasteland. But in a way that makes them, of course, the most empathetic.\n: I don't think you really can set out to please the fans of anything, or please anyone other than yourself. I think you have to come into this trying to make the show that you want to make it and trusting that as fans of the game, we would find the pieces that were essential to us about the games and try to do the best version of those that we can. I think it's kind of a fool's errand to try to figure out how to make people happy in that way. You gotta make yourself happy. And I've made myself very happy with the show.\n show was co-created by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Graham Wagner and developed by Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy​​​​​​.\n How Key Elements From The Fallout Games Were Adapted For The Show \nAs Nolan and Wagner allude to, Power armor was one of the most important and ambitious elements from the Fallout games for the show to get right. Power armor acts as an iconic symbol of the Fallout series and is often associated with the Brotherhood of Steel. Its distinctive design, including its helmet and bulky frame which protect against radiation, made it difficult to adapt to live-action. However, with attention to detail and incredible production design, the Fallout show appears to have pulled it off with Power armor that looks accurate to the games.\n Related Fallout Show's Power Armor Suit Is A Big Sigh Of Relief For The Live-Action Adaptation Amazon Prime Video's Fallout show has revealed a first look at its power armor, and it should be a good sign for cautiously optimistic fans. \nAnother key element from the Fallout games that was successfully adapted for the show is the factions. As Robertson-Dworet mentions, each of the main characters in the show is representative of one of the main factions from the games.

Perry played an instrumental role during RCB’s 23-run triumph over UP Warriorz at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. In the 19th over, the Australian star smashed the window of the display car in Deepti Sharma’s over, producing a sight that spectators don’t see quite often. After the game, she talked about her window breaking six and said, “Not sure I have insurance here to cover that.” RCB’s win saw them complete their home-leg fixtures with an important win. Perry talked about the atmosphere of the stadium and the support that the team received from the home crowd. “All five games here have been amazing. Best atmosphere without doubt I have played in my whole career. It’s such a cool feeling to have such support,” she added. Perry throughout her innings backed skipper Smriti Mandhana who was leading the assault on the opposition bowlers. Perry defined her role during the 95-run stand which guided RCB to a mamoth total of 198/3. “Have played a lot of cricket in the last two months. It’s just the nature of the format, sometimes it clicks. My role was to support Smriti initially and then I could release. Really trying to pride ourselves with our fielding, it’s tricky when there’s a left-right combination. We put in a great effort. It was really great from the girls tonight. Great to finish on a high in front of our home fans,” she concluded. Coming to the match, after an impressive display with the bat, RCB bowlers managed to take wickets at regular intervals which ensured Warriorz ended the night on the losing side. Alyssa Healy (55) played a captain’s knock but the constantly increasing asking rate got the better of her. Sophie Molineux cashed in and claimed the captain’s wicket. Deepti Sharma and Poonam Khemnar managed to put up a meaningful 41-run stand but eventually, their efforts went in vain as RCB comfortably emerged victorious.","length":2195,"publishedTime":"2024-03-05T16:42:50.000Z","rating":[6,8,7,6,8,7,8],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the incident involving Ellyse Perry breaking the display car's window during a cricket match.

Israel did not send a delegation to the latest round of talks.\nMeanwhile, Israel wants Hamas to hand over a list of captives who are alive, as well as the captive-to-prisoner ratio it seeks in any release deal.\nSenior Hamas leader Bassem Naim told the AFP news agency on Monday that the group did not know “who among [the captives] are alive or dead, killed because of strikes or hunger”, and that the captives were being held by numerous groups in multiple places.\n“So there are two completely different perspectives and two different sticking points here on what the other side is not willing to compromise on,” Salhut said.\nAt US-Qatar Strategic Dialogue talks on Tuesday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Hamas to accept the ceasefire plan.\n“It is on Hamas to make decisions about whether it is prepared to engage in that ceasefire,” the top US diplomat said as he met Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani in Washington, DC, in the US.\n“Qatar, the United States and our partners will be always persistent to make sure that this deal happens,” said Al Thani, standing next to Blinken.\nWith the latest round of discussions having come to an end, Hamas has presented a proposal that mediators will discuss with Israel in the coming days, two Egyptian officials said, according to The Associated Press news agency.\nAt least 1,139 people were killed and about 250 captives were taken in Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on October 7. More than 100 captives were released during a weeklong ceasefire in November.\nIsrael’s retaliatory offensive on Gaza has killed more than 30,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry.\nThe nearly five months of fighting have left much of Gaza in ruins and created a worsening humanitarian catastrophe, with many, especially in the devastated northern region, scrambling for food to survive.","length":3814,"publishedTime":"2024-03-05T20:12:07Z","rating":[2,4,3,4,3,4,3],"reason":"The article scored low in Accuracy due to some potentially misleading information, such as the number of casualties being overstated.

This is how to find the kinder, more uplifting side of the internet | Chris Anderson","byline":"Chris Anderson","excerpt":"It is easy to see the world in a pessimistic light, but by tapping into our innate generosity we have the power to change it, says Chris Anderson, the head of TED","textContent":"As a determined optimist, I never thought I’d be saying this, but it’s true: the world is mean and getting meaner. Instead of bringing us together, the internet seems to have fuelled our divisions by empowering those who are best at sowing fear, mistrust and outrage. We’re angry with each other over migrants, gender identity, climate catastrophe, wokeness and so much more.A recent survey by King’s College London found that for the first time a majority (52%) of the UK population believes that culture wars are a serious problem for society and politics. I’m sick of this. I suspect you are too. I’ve spent the last few years looking for an antidote. Just possibly, it can be found in a pair of human instincts wired deeply inside us: generosity, and our response to it. At the start of the pandemic lockdown, stories of death, chaos and grocery-hoarding filled the media. Like many of us, an Australian woman, Catherine Barrett, felt on the edge of tears much of the time. One day, one of her neighbours put a box of tissues on the communal table in her building with just a simple note: “Please take if needed.”Barrett was deeply touched by the act. It gave her an idea. She created a new group on Facebook and posted a picture of the box of tissues and the neighbour’s note. She wrote: “I’m setting this group up to spread kindness … to restore our faith in each other.” She called her group the Kindness Pandemic. The group quickly grew to more than 500,000 people, with members from all over the world telling stories of kind acts they had witnessed or done themselves.Barrett’s group proved that simple acts of human kindness are happening around the world every moment of every day. But they are largely invisible to us, drowned out by headline-grabbing nastiness. Why do we do this to ourselves?It’s not as if the dark stories somehow reveal a deeper truth. Yes, it’s awful that 100 people died in a violent incident today. But is that really more significant than the fact that more than 20,000 children’s lives were saved today, and every day this year, thanks to the tireless efforts of tens of thousands of invisible public heath workers over the last three decades? Their remarkable generosity has led to the global infant mortality rate falling by 59% since 1990. By succumbing to the allure of the dramatic and the recent, we are inadvertently feeding ourselves a poisoned worldview. No wonder we feel sick.What would it take for tales of kindness to eclipse tales of violence and fear and division? Here are three of the catalysts that can help nudge acts of kindness across that chasm.The first is simply emotion. Sometimes, the positive stories we share are told in the dry language of statistics or generalisations. The statistic above about the spectacular fall in preventable childhood deaths may have connected with you intellectually, but I doubt that it moved you. Yet if you were to sit down and watch the Carter Center YouTube video that shows what childhood Guinea worm disease looks like and how it is being eradicated, you would feel intense emotions – including dismay, disgust and deep gratitude. The numbers are incredible – a reduction from 3.5m cases in 1986 to just 13 in 2022 – but seeing for yourself a 2ft worm being pulled out of a screaming child is what will make you care. It’s no wonder then that this video has been seen 18m times and has done as much as anything to alert the world to the incredible story of a horrifying disease being consigned to history.Second, courage. Dylan Marron is used to haters on the internet. As a proudly progressive content creator, he made a series of social justice-oriented videos, covering topics such as police brutality and the controversies surrounding transgender people’s use of public bathrooms. As the number of views soared, however, so did the aggressive comments from strangers.Reeling from the barrage of hate, Marron developed an unexpected coping mechanism. He messaged a few of his trolls, asking if they would like to get on the phone with him. The result? He was able to find common ground. One 18-year-old troll who had told him he was a moron and that being gay was a sin turned out – like him – to have been bullied in school and to share Marron’s love of the movie Finding Dory.Third, creativity. The bolder, the better. A group of friends in Japan were sick of the litter on the streets of Tokyo. But instead of just going out there and tidying up, they decided to do so in a way that would get noticed. They dressed up as samurai warriors and used their acting skills to pick up the trash with drama and panache, grabbing discarded bottles with tongs, and flipping trash into the baskets on their backs. It’s easy to understand why the videos of them in action have been seen by millions and attracted many to join the group.We live at an incredible moment in history. It’s possible today to give away knowledge, creativity, connection and enchantment at unlimited scale. It’s also possible to amplify stories of other people’s kindness like never before. Everyone can do this. Next time you are on social media, look for someone somewhere who’s sharing something positive – anything from a kind comment to a gift of creative, uplifting content. There are so many of them out there. Like them. Repost them. Follow them. It will start to teach the algorithms controlling your feed that you are not the person they thought you were. And it may help lift this content into other people’s feeds. The ripple begins.\n Chris Anderson is the founder of Future Publishing and the head of TED.

Fourth over of the second morning of a Test match. A bowler who has 698 wickets - more than any other fast bowler in the history of the game - is running in with the hope of using the early freshness of the surface, perhaps even to check if there is any reverse on offer. What does the batter do? He charges down the track to hit the legendary bowler straight over his head for an 85m six. The times are changing in Test cricket. Actually, they have changed, we, the admirers of the game, just have to get accustomed to it. Shubman Gill charges down he track to hit Anderson for a six Not that it needs much brainstorming for cricket fans but the bowler in question was England's Jimmy Anderson and the batter, India's Shubman Gill. This has been a difficult series for Anderson. Not because he has bowled poorly, he rarely (never) does but because his wickets column hasn't changed much and he hasn't quite got the respect that he deserves from India's young batters. The second part would hurt Anderson more. Hindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now. It was Yashasvi Jaiswal, who took him to the cleaners by hitting him for a hat-trick of sixes on Day 4 of the third Test in Rajkot. on Day 2 of the fifth and final Test in Dharamsala, it was Gill's turn. The right-hander was not as severe as his teammate but the shot that he hit in the second ball of the 34th over of the Indian innings would be talked about for long. India vs England 5th Test Live ScoreAnderson was looking for reverse swing. The field was set for a line straighter to the stumps. Gill anticipated that. Just when Anderson was about to release the ball he took a couple of steps straight down the wicket. Took the ball on the half-volley and it straight over Anderson's head for a six. It was classy. It was audacious. It was giving Bazball a taste of its own medicine. The expression of England captain Ben Stokes said it all. Watch: Shubman Gill charges down the track to hit James Anderson for a straight six Did Gill plan for this? We would never know but the way he held the pose, tracking the ball's trajectory into the stands would always make the fans wonder. That six somewhat rattled Anderson. He dragged his length back a couple of balls later and Gill pounced on the width, flat batting the ball to the right of point for a boundary. It was a statement of sorts from India in the first session of Day 2. This has been an unlike Gill innings. He shed the watchful tag and looked positive right from the onset. His first six came on the last over of Day 1. Yes, you read that right. He is the same batter who took 120 balls to hit a boundary in the second innings of the fourth Test. Batting situation and all that. He reached his fifty off just 64 balls, one of his fastest in Test cricket. Earlier, India took the honours on Day 1 courtesy of Kuldeep Yadav. The left-arm wrist spinner ran through England's top and middle-order with a record-breaking spell of bowling before Ravichandran Ashwin, in his 100th Test, made light work of the lower order. India bowled England out for 218 after Ben Stokes opted to bat. In reply, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Rohit Sharma gave India a rollicking start, which they have done so often in this series. Jaiswal became the second Indian batter after Sunil Gavaskar to score more than 700 runs in a series. The left-hander was out for 57 off 58 balls while trying to hit Shoaib Bashir for a lofted shot. Rohit (52*) and Shubam Gill (26*) made sure there were no further losses as India reached 135/1 at stumps.

He’s been going through the “Terrible Twos,” and as you can imagine, it’s been terrible. His thing right now is that he will throw a fit, and then when he’s done, he will wrap his arms around me and say, “I love you, Mommy!”Well, my husband’s aunt has rolled around after her partner died suddenly and left her with nothing. She is pretty rude sometimes, in my opinion. She regularly tells my son that he’s mean or he’s bad. She never really praises him when he’s good. I’m not a fan of telling him he’s mean or bad all the time. It does nothing to help his behavior; he’s only 2, and he’s got those big feelings he can’t express yet.Besides, when he understands that she’s telling him he is mean or bad, he will start acting that way more. I lost it the other day. She told him again he’s mean and I said, “He’s 2!” And she said, “That’s no excuse! He is just flat-out mean!” I took my son upstairs to get away from her since he is “flat-out mean.”This woman, I should add, did not stick around for her kids. She blames other people for her reasons for leaving and has absolutely nothing good to say about them. She also tells me all the time he only throws tantrums because I’m here. I’m also not trying to excuse his behavior; she just needs to quit talking to him that way because it does nothing but makes things worse. What can I do? — Mama BearDear Mama Bear: You can establish boundaries for yourself and your son. That boundary is with your aunt. The boundary is as follows: If she insults your son again or criticizes your parenting or him in any way, she is not allowed to see him. Period. She has no right to place her own adult judgments on a 2-year-old child. Her words, “He is just mean,” sound a lot like what she is being to you and him. Until she stops projecting her own negative feelings about herself onto you and your son, she is not allowed to be around you. That is toxic behavior and cannot be tolerated.Dear Annie: I’m a 67-year-old woman and dating a 70-year-old man.We live an hour apart. He lives on a farm and is divorced. He told me he enjoys his own company. He is very bright and funny. I have only physically seen him four or five times in the past year. He had an extremely painful divorce, and I am widowed. He calls me every night at the end of his day, and we talk and laugh for an hour or two.But he never invites me over. I have suggested we cook together or listen to music for a few holidays. Each time I ask to get together, he puts me off. I’m quite smitten with him, but sometimes I feel like I’m really not that special to him. He is a very sweet talker; we hug at the end of each date and share a brief kiss. — Fizzling Out AffectionDear Fizzling Out: I don’t blame you. It is going to be really challenging to have a relationship with someone that you never physically see. The nice long phone conversations are great. You can keep those, but by no means make him your number one. He can just be a friend if he doesn’t want to physically spend time with you.“How Can I Forgive My Cheating Partner?” is out now!

A residence in resonance with the landscape has become the model for a tourist accommodation scheme","textContent":"Daichi Isumi is a villa set on an elevation that overlooks a bend in the Isumi River, in the Japanese prefecture of Chiba, at a point where the countryside meets the watercourse. It is the work of the architect Makoto Tanijiri, founder of Suppose Design Office as well as an agency specializing in rental or time-sharing residences. The idea took shape during the pandemic, when Tanijiri started to explore this area between the river and the ocean, imagining new ways of living in nature that would not renounce the comforts of contemporary architecture. “I wanted to create an interesting and resistant setting, where it would be possible to go on living in a way that we like even in the case of a new pandemic,” explains Tanijiri. Thus Daichi Isumi was born as a prototype of a residence in resonance with the landscape, serving as a model for what is going to become a wider scheme of tourist accommodation. \nThe building is very simple, a regular structure surmounted by a pitched roof. But, once across the threshold, the spectacular nature of the views and the rigorous minimalism of the spatial organization generate a strong effect of surprise. The living room occupies most of the space. Laid out on more than one level and sloping down towards the forest, its distinctive character derives from the presence of two adjoining elements: the sculptural table of rough-cut wood and the large opening that frames the river, screened only by elegant sliding doors in the shoji style, a reference to traditional Japanese architecture. The living room also extends outside, where a concrete platform ends at the infinity pool, reaching out towards the river bank. The kitchen area is embedded in one of the steps of the living room, with the worktop almost on the same level. The layout of the villa is completed by three sober bedrooms, with windows opening onto the landscape and ceilings traversed by long strips of wood that have the optical effect of expanding the perception of the space. Below the main volume of the house, in the basement, a Finnish sauna faces onto an ample sundeck, offering an unusual and intimate view of the river. \nThe living area integrates the kitchen into one of the steps that characterize the space. Long strips of wood run across the ceiling, with the optical effect of expanding perception of the space. (ph. Kenta Hasegawa)\nThe dark tone of the finishes and the warm one of the wooden furniture have been chosen to blend in with those of the forest, creating a perceptual continuum between natural and artificial, while the sliding walls, the arrangement of the windows and the construction materials function as means of climate control. Thanks in part to the natural cooling provided by the river there is no need for air conditioning and the spartan woodstove in the living area is sufficient for heating. With artificial systems of cooling and heating, says Tanijiri, there would have been a risk of the occupants shutting themselves up inside the house as if it were a hotel, losing the magic of the forest that sways gently with the breeze and the timeless music of the babbling water.","length":3247,"publishedTime":"2024-02-20T06:30:00+00:00","rating":[null],"reason":"rating:","conclusion":"9, 8, 7, 9, 8, 9]\r\nreason: The article provides a detailed description of the Daichi Isumi villa designed by architect Makoto Tanijiri.

But some say these tools could harm research. Scientists are already using image-generating models to jazz up papers and presentations. But some say these tools could harm research.","textContent":"Tools such as Sora can generate convincing video footage from text prompts.Credit: Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools that translate text descriptions into images and video are advancing rapidly.Just as many researchers are using ChatGPT to transform the process of scientific writing, others are using AI image generators such as Midjourney, Stable Diffusion and DALL-E to cut down on the time and effort it takes to produce diagrams and illustrations. However, researchers warn that these AI tools could spur an increase in fake data and inaccurate scientific imagery.Nature looks at how researchers are using these tools, and what their increasing popularity could mean for science.How do text-to-image tools work?Many text-to-image AI tools, such as Midjourney and DALL-E, rely on machine-learning algorithms called diffusion models that are trained to recognize the links between millions of images scraped from the Internet and text descriptions of those images. These models have advanced in recent years owing to improvements in hardware and the availability of large data sets for training. After training, diffusion models can use text prompts to generate new images.What are researchers using them for?Some researchers are already using AI-generated images to illustrate methods in scientific papers. Others are using them to promote papers in social-media posts or to spice up presentation slides. “They are using tools like DALL-E 3 for generating nice-looking images to frame research concepts,” says AI researcher Juan Rodriguez at ServiceNow Research in Montreal, Canada. “I gave a talk last Thursday about my work and I used DALL-E 3 to generate appealing images to keep people’s attention,” he says.Text-to-video tools are also on the rise, but seem to be less widely used by researchers who are not actively developing or studying these tools, says Rodriguez. However, this could soon change. Last month, ChatGPT creator OpenAI in San Francisco, California, released video clips generated by a text-to-video tool called Sora. “With the experiments we saw with Sora, it seems their method is much more robust at getting results quickly,” says Rodriguez. “We are early in terms of text-to-video, but I guess this year we will find out how this develops,” he adds.What are the benefits of using these tools?Generative AI tools can reduce the time taken to produce images or figures for papers, conference posters or presentations. Conventionally, researchers use a range of non-AI tools, such as PowerPoint, BioRender, and Inkscape. “If you really know how to use these tools, you can make really impressive figures, but it’s time-consuming,” says Rodriguez.AI tools can also improve the quality of images for researchers who find it hard to translate scientific concepts into visual aids, says Rodriguez. With generative AI, researchers still come up with the high-level idea for the image, but they can use the AI to refine it, he says.What are the risks?Currently, AI tools can produce convincing artwork and some illustrations, but they are not yet able to generate complex scientific figures with text annotations. “They don’t get the text right — the text is sometimes too small, much bigger or rotated,” says Rodriguez. The kind of problems that can arise were made clear in a paper published in Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology in mid-February, in which researchers used Midjourney to depict a rat’s reproductive organs1. The result, which passed peer review, was a cartoon rodent with comically enormous genitalia, annotated with gibberish.“It was this really weird kind of grotesque image of a rat,” says palaeoartist Henry Sharpe, a palaeontology student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. This incident is one of the “biggest case[s] involving AI-generated images to date”, says Guillaume Cabanac, who studies fraudulent AI-generated text at the University of Toulouse, France. After a public outcry from researchers, the paper was retracted.\n This now-infamous AI-generated figure featured in a scientific paper that was later retracted.Credit: X. Guo et al./Front. Cell Dev. Biol.\nThere is also the possibility that AI tools could make it easier for scientific fraudsters to produce fake data or observations, says Rodriguez. Papers might contain not only AI-generated text, but also AI-generated figures, he says. And there is currently no robust method for detecting such images and videos. “It's going to get pretty scary in the sense we are going to be bombarded by fake and synthetically generated data,” says Rodriguez. To address this, some researchers are developing ways to inject signals into AI-generated images to enable their detection.Why has there been a backlash from some fields?Last month, Sharpe launched a poll on social-media platforms including X, Facebook and Instagram that surveyed the views of around 90 palaeontologists on AI-generated depictions of ancient life. “Just one in four professional palaeontologists thought that AI should be allowed to be in scientific publications,” says Sharpe.AI-generated images of ancient lifeforms or fossils can mislead both scientists and the public, he adds. “It’s inaccurate, all it does is copy existing things and it can’t actually go out and read papers.” Iteratively reconstructing ancient lifeforms by hand, in consultation with palaeontologists, can reveal plausible anatomical features — a process that is completely lost when using AI, Sharpe says. Palaeoartists and palaeontologists have aired similar views on X using the hashtag #PaleoAgainstAI.How are publishers adapting to the popularity of these tools?Journals differ in their policies around AI-generated imagery. Springer Nature has banned the use of AI-generated images, videos and illustrations in most journal articles that are not specifically about AI (Nature’s news team is independent of its publisher, Springer Nature). Journals in the Science family do not allow AI-generated text, figures or images to be used without explicit permission from the editors, unless the paper is specifically about AI or machine learning. PLOS ONE allows the use of AI tools but states that researchers must declare the tool involved, how they used it and how they verified the quality of the generated content.","length":6399,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,8,6,8,7,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed overview of artificial intelligence tools that generate images and videos from text prompts, including their rapid advancements and potential impact on research.

But as Germany’s debate on immigration harshens, this far-right party is becoming a powerful electoral threat.","textContent":"When Martin Sellner visited Chemnitz, eastern Germany, on February 23, around three hundred demonstrators summoned by the Nazi-Free Chemnitz group ensured the Austrian agitator knew he was unwelcome. Sellner, former spokesperson of the radical-right Identitarian Movement Austria, has become infamous in Germany in recent weeks.\nIn January, independent investigative platform Correctiv reported that Sellner had presented his racist theses during a secret meeting organized by two businessmen in Potsdam. In attendance were members of the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). The CDU attendees were low-ranking figures, and the party is working on their expulsion. But the AfD participants included Roland Hartwig — at that time a personal aide to party coleader Alice Weidel, until the Correctiv revelations forced them to part ways — and Ulrich Siegmund, who is the AfD parliamentary leader in Saxony-Anhalt state.\nSellner’s presentation in Potsdam revolved around the concept of “remigration.” The term is not new but became ominously specific in the Potsdam meeting. According to the Austrian anti-immigration campaigner, a far-right government in Germany should plan the deportation of asylum seekers, non-Germans with residency rights, and “non-assimilated” German citizens. The Correctiv revelations have led to massive demonstrations in Germany against the far right. In the protest against Sellner in Chemnitz, one chant specifically countered his plan: “Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here.”\nAccording to polling conducted soon after the Correctiv revelations, the AfD slipped from 22 percent of the vote to 19 percent in a month. This still placed it in a comfortable second place nationally, trailing the CDU alone — and above all three parties in the current federal government. The ruling coalition, made up of the Social Democrats, the Greens, and the neoliberal hawks of the Free Democrats, is deeply unpopular.\nI spoke to Dr Johannes Kiess, a sociologist and deputy director of the Else-Frenkel-Brunswik-Institute at the University of Leipzig, which researches antidemocratic movements. He noted that parts of German civil society needed a moment such as the Correctiv revelations to further mobilize against the far right. The sociologist added that the news about the Potsdam meeting represents a good starting point for a campaign against the AfD. A different question is whether such a campaign should include a call for a ban on the AfD by the German constitutional court. This topic has been hotly debated in recent weeks, with positions for and against a ban cutting across party lines. According to Kiess, one argument in favor of proscribing the AfD is that it would send a strong message to the CDU that reaching any agreement with the far-right party is unacceptable.\n Such a message would be particularly important in the current context. As concerning as polls for the next German federal elections are, they won’t be held until late 2025. The more immediate danger is this September’s elections in the states of Saxony, Thuringia, and Brandenburg. In the three eastern Länder, the AfD is polling in first place, at around or above 30 percent support. The CDU’s official position is that it will not enter any coalition government with either the AfD or the left-wing Die Linke. Although this could be possible in Saxony and Brandenburg with the repetition of the current “Kenya” coalitions (named after the respective party colors of the CDU, Social Democrats, and the Greens), things are different in Thuringia.\nThere, Die Linke is stronger — it has held the presidency of the region almost uninterruptedly since 2014, with Bodo Ramelow at the helm. Although Die Linke is now polling third-placed in Thuringia, absent a major change before September the CDU will be faced with the dilemma of aligning itself with either the AfD or Die Linke. There are strong reasons to doubt that the CDU will choose the left-wing option. In the Thuringian parliament, the CDU has already voted together with the AfD, and the same applies to many subregional parliaments in the Eastern Länder.\nThe AfD in Thuringia is particularly extreme. Its leader, Björn Höcke, has openly used Nazi terms such as “racial suicide,” “Lebensraum” (living space), and “cultural Bolshevism.” He has, moreover, been a key factor in the general radicalization of this party at various tipping points, such as the party congresses of 2015 and 2017 and the election of candidates for the regional elections in eastern Germany in 2019. Höcke achieved this through Der Flügel (The Wing), a grouping within the AfD that formally dissolved in 2020 but which is in truth increasingly powerful. Höcke and his allies, like the former AfD member and party leader in Brandenburg state Andreas Kalbitz, have managed to move the AfD even further to the Right while rising in the polls.\nIt was also Höcke’s Flügel, explains journalist Eva Kienholz in her book Ihr Kampf (Their Struggle), that cemented close contacts with the Identitarian Movement Germany, i.e., this country’s branch of Sellner’s organization in Austria. In 2017, members of the German Identitarians, together with other right-wing extremists from France and Italy, hired a ship to prevent NGOs in the Mediterranean from helping boats in distress. After running into technical problems, the racist agitators had to be helped by Sea Eye, a German NGO they had previously demonized.\n Although the AfD bears a major responsibility for the portrayal of migrants and asylum seekers as threats, the problem runs deeper. In a late 2023 poll for the public broadcaster, Germans were asked to name the two most important problems their country is facing. An astonishing 44 percent mentioned migration — as much as climate change, social inequality, or the economy added together. Germany has recently experienced a considerable increase in the number of migrants and asylum seekers arriving, and the number of asylum applications reached 334,000 in 2023. Although the absolute numbers are high, per capita applications are far lower than in countries like Cyprus or Greece, and only a bit higher than in Spain. None of these countries is nearly as wealthy as Germany.\nRegional and local governments in Germany have expressed reasonable concerns about their difficulties in managing the new arrivals, and the federal government has gone some way into addressing the issue. The zeitgeist at the different levels of governance, however, is not one of improving the conditions for people reaching Germany. In January, the German government approved measures to facilitate the incorporation of new arrivals into the workforce — but it will also accelerate the deportation of unsuccessful asylum seekers. The police will be allowed to carry out searches in the residences of migrants or deport them without prior notice.\nThe current trend is toward making Germany less attractive for noncitizens, in the rather questionable belief that this will reduce numbers arriving. This is the motivation behind the introduction of a paying card for asylum seekers, who will soon receive only a fraction of their monthly allowance in cash. The rest will have to be spent in the shops near their place of residence, where payment with a card will be allowed. In Germany, especially in rural areas, payment via credit card is often not possible. The independent organization Pro Asyl describes the payment card as an “instrument of discrimination” that will only complicate asylum seekers’ lives.\nFurthermore, the CDU is advocating for a so-called Rwanda Plan to prevent migrants from reaching Germany in the first place. The idea, modeled after the British project to fly irregular migrants to Rwanda right after their arrival and process asylum requests in the African country, contradicts the most basic human rights legislation. The UK Supreme Court also saw things this way when it felled the proposal made by Rishi Sunak’s government. Austria and Denmark have also been toying with the idea.\nIn Germany, the possibility of processing asylum requests in African countries is not only an idea among the right-wing opposition; indeed, the Interior Ministry is reportedly studying similar options. As in many European countries, in Germany there is a widespread call for controlled migration flows, often focused on the need for migrants to fill jobs as the German population ages. This can be seen in many business leaders’ support for the anti-AfD demonstrations, as well as in the citizenship law recently approved in parliament.\nThe new legislation speeds up the citizenship process for people with a migration background, provided that they do not rely on social welfare. Yet, the process is now more complicated for those who do need state support and for those who cannot work full-time because they have disabilities or are raising children by themselves. There are theoretical provisions for hardship cases, but it’s not clear how they would work in practice.\n When I spoke with two members of Nazi-Free Chemnitz, which organized the protest against Martin Sellner, they told me about the increasingly hostile climate for migrants and asylum seekers in Germany. They explained that the current migration debate is utterly at odds with reality — describing how new arrivals are often accused of not being willing to work, when it is actually legal hurdles that prevent them from doing so. As for the complicated path to German citizenship for people reliant on social welfare, the activists note that “people should not have to earn their right to be treated as human beings.”\nThe Nazi-Free Chemnitz group’s activism against the far right is no easy task in a city where the AfD captured 21.6 percent of the votes already in the last federal elections in fall 2021 — twice the party’s national average, at the time. But the situation, they explain, is even more complicated in rural areas, where activism for human rights and democracy meets with serious threats. In the electoral district that includes the towns surrounding Chemnitz, the AfD received more than a quarter of all votes in 2021.\nAs if the presence of the AfD and the Identitarian Movement in Chemnitz was not enough, the region also features two other far-right movements, Free Saxony and Pro Chemnitz. The latter organized the protests, also joined by AfD members, that led in August 2018 to massive attacks against people with a migration background in Chemnitz. The scenes of violence followed the death of a Cuban German in a fight with two migrants in the city center. Faced with the passivity of police, who are generally more concerned to investigate nonviolent left-wing groups than right-wing extremists, attacks against people perceived as foreigners went on for two days.\nIn eastern Germany, the AfD and other radical-right movements have a stronger presence than in other parts of the country, and this is most likely to be reflected in the regional elections next September. This notwithstanding, eastern Germany also has a civil society that has long known about the dangers of letting right-wing radicalism grow, and which takes to the streets in the same towns where the stakes are highest. Even faced with difficult odds, this seems more urgent than ever.","length":12098,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[5,7,6,6,7,6,5],"reason":"The article provides detailed information about the rise of the far-right in Germany and the actions taken against it.

The servers are always great here, so we have no problem giving them our money as well as the restaurant because the food is great,\" he said. \n\"I love it.

A customer's check will also reflect suggested additional tip amounts of 8%, 10%, and 12%, which are not required. The server or bartender keeps 100% of the additional tip. Matthew Loder, CEO of Crabby Bill's Seafood, said the new service fee allows him to keep up with the rising cost of business.\"So it prevents us from having to short portions. We don’t have to keep raising prices because I can only pay so much, my guest can only pay so much so we’re very sensitive to that,\" said Loder.

In January, ABC Action News reported on other Tampa Bay restaurants implementing a similar model. Southern Fresh on 3rd Avenue North in Safety Harbor adds a 20% service charge to every check for customers who dine at the restaurant. The fee does not apply to takeout orders.

Senedd Members will decide on March 13 whether to accept the recommendation that Mr ab Owen should be suspended.\nThe committee’s lengthy report into the matter, published on March 6, is critical of Plaid Cymru’s handling of the issue. It states: “The evidence gathered by the Commissioner shows that the complainant in this case and witness A [who was also touched inappropriately by Mr ab Owen] raised the matter that day (1 July 2021) within Plaid Cymru. The account of the internal party process in the Commissioner’s report shows that the processes then undertaken by the party in dealing with this matter, were in the committee’s view, inadequate and ineffective.\n“The Commissioner outlines in his report: ‘I had no power to investigate the processes under which the concerns expressed by the complainant and by witness A were handled by Plaid Cymru. It was, however, apparent, as was confirmed by the then chief executive, that they were very far from satisfactory.\n“Lest similarly ineffective processes exist in other political parties, I have written to the leaders in Wales of all other parties represented in the Senedd asking them to satisfy themselves that appropriate processes are in place and known to all staff employed by their party and by all support staff employed by Members of their party.’\n“The complainant and witness A reported the incident to their line managers, and this was then escalated to the chief whip [Sian Gwenllian], who spoke with them and the Member. As a result of these conversations the Member agreed to apologise for his behaviour – the Member was provided at this point with the complainant’s telephone number and subsequently called her to apologise. The Committee does not consider the provision of a phone number in these circumstances to be an appropriate step to have taken in a complaint of this nature.\n“The extensive paperwork that was produced by the complainant and Plaid Cymru as evidence to the Commissioner shows that there was insufficient support provided for those involved. There is no evidence that there was a proper process in place, and that if there was this was not communicated to anyone involved.\n“Matters such as these need to have a clear and equitable process which is understood by all; it is not sufficient to try and deal with these matters extemporaneously. Alongside a lack of clear procedure, it also appears that there was no process for checking in with those involved to ensure that they were satisfied with the steps taken. The lack of a clear procedure and accompanying paperwork means that it was more difficult to establish what the Member was told when about the complaint, or indeed whether the Complainant was formally complaining to the party.”\nThe matter was kept out of the public domain by Plaid Cymru and only taken forward a year later when a formal complaint about the incident was made to the Standards Commissioner.\nMeanwhile in July 2020, Jonathan Edwards, the Plaid Cymru MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, had been suspended from the party for 12 months after accepting a police caution for assaulting his wife.\nHe was put through the party’s disciplinary process and suspended by a panel of senior party members. They took into account the fact that he was given a caution rather than charged with an offence, reflecting the fact that the assault was a one-off incident rather than part of an ongoing pattern of domestic violence and that in terms of gravity it was at the lower end of the scale.\nThe panel told Mr Edwards that he would be free to make an application to rejoin the party a year later on condition that he undertook a course about domestic violence, which he did. Although the disciplinary panel said Mr Edwards could rejoin the party, Plaid’s National Executive Committee overruled the panel and said he should not return.\nHe continues to sit as an Independent MP. The events involving Mr Edwards were all conducted in the public domain.\nReflecting on the differences in the way Plaid Cymru treated him and Rhys ab Owen respectively, Mr Edwards said: “It is clear that Adam Price, as leader of Plaid Cymru, and Siân Gwenllian, as chief whip, sat on the allegations against Rhys ab Owen for a year and effectively engaged in a cover-up.\n“Plaid Cymru did nothing and the matter was only investigated properly after a complaint was made to the Standards Commissioner. Meanwhile they supported Plaid’s National Executive Committee in overturning the proportionate findings of a disciplinary panel in my case and forced me out of the party. This is pure hypocrisy.”\nMr Edwards went on to refer to Prosiect Pawb, a review of Plaid’s approach to allegations of bullying and sexual harassment undertaken on the party’s behalf by former MS Nerys Evans. She concluded that the party was riddled with a toxic culture of bullying, harassment and misogyny. Her findings led to the resignation as leader of Adam Price and his subsequent replacement by Rhun ap Iorwerth.\nMr Edwards said: “If Plaid’s Prosiect Pawb has any meaning, sanctions should be imposed on Adam Price and Siân Gwenllian in particular. This is a serious test of Rhun ap Iorwerth’s leadership. If he is serious about Prosiect Pawb, he must remove the whip. Will he cover up a cover-up or act with honour?”\nOn March 6, when the Standards Committee report into Mr ab Owen was published, Plaid Cymru issued a statement that said the party was taking “swift and appropriate action in response” to the report and Rhys ab Owen had now been suspended from the party as well as the Senedd group.\nThe statement added: “In light of the conclusions of the report, Rhys ab Owen MS’s membership of the party has been suspended pending the outcome of an internal process that will commence immediately. The report follows a lengthy investigation and comes to a series of conclusions regarding the behaviour of the Member.\n“It also references shortcomings in the party’s processes which pre-dates Prosiect Pawb – a wholesale review of Plaid Cymru’s practices and culture. Decisive action has been taken to implement the recommendations and strengthen the party’s governance.”\nAsked to respond to Mr Edwards’ comments, a Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: “We have nothing to add to the statement [quoted above] we issued yesterday.”\nFor the price of a cup of coffee a month you can help us create an\nindependent, not-for-profit, national news service for the people of Wales, by","length":7098,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T19:23:29+00:00","rating":[5,6,7,5,6,6,6],"reason":"- Accuracy: The article provides a detailed account of the alleged cover-up incident involving former Plaid leader Adam Price, chief whip Sian Gwenllian, and MS Rhys ab Owen, based on the findings of the Senedd’s Standards Committee and the investigation by Standards Commissioner Douglas Bain.

Offenders can be brought to justice and we can have answers for Marc's family and friends.\"Police want to speak to:Anyone who knows something about Marc refuelling his white ute on January 18, 2000 at the Shell service station at Gympie, or the passenger with him.Anyone who remembers seeing Marc at the Booyal Roadhouse using the payphone on January 26.Anyone who knows anyone in Booyal or Childers who drove a brown Ford sedan with a bull-bar in 2000.Last call from GympieKris Mietus, previously said his son appeared to be out of cash and rang from a Gympie petrol station before he went missing, asking for money. In 2017, Kris Mietus told the ABC he said to his son that the then-21-year-old had made the decision to leave and was \"on his own now\". Marc Mietus moved from Melbourne to Queensland in early January 2000. (Supplied)That same week, the 21-year-old sold his car and bought a motorbike. On the last day he was seen, Marc arrived at the Booyal property at 6:30am. Several hours later he was seen with a group of people leaving the address. Police believe Marc was murdered that same month. Look back at how ABC readers and other Australians responded to this live moment.Wondering what this is?

Here are 10 easy meal ideas using products from the chain.\n As a dietitian and former employee, I love to shop at Trader Joe's for ingredients for some of my go-to meals.\n This sweet-potato gnocchi with spinach and sausage is both sweet and savory.\n The sweetness of Trader Joe's gnocchi contrasts with the saltiness of the sausage.\n This meal takes 10 minutes to come together and it's truly satisfying.To make, just follow the instructions on the back of the gnocchi bag, then add in some precooked cut-up chicken sausage and a handful of spinach. Let the spinach wilt and top with grated Parmesan for some added fat and flavor.I love how the sweetness from the sweet-potato gnocchi contrasts with the savory garlic chicken sausage.I view meals from a gentle-nutrition standpoint, which is about choosing foods that satisfy your cravings while still honoring your health. From that perspective, this meal is completely optimized as it includes all the macronutrients: carbohydrates (gnocchi), protein (chicken sausage), fat (chicken sausage and cheese), and fiber (sautéed spinach).\n With intuitive eating, you get to choose salad or fries depending on what your body is asking for on any given day.\n Diet culture often deems burgers and fries as \"junk food,\" but as an intuitive-eating dietitian, I help my clients remove the moral value of food. A burger is not morally inferior to a salad.They are both just foods that offer different amounts of micro and macronutrients. In fact, a burger can actually be an optimized and satisfying meal. This meal includes all the macronutrients — carbohydrates (bun), protein (burger), fat (cheese), and fiber (arugula and onions).Most of the time, I enjoy my burger with Trader Joe's frozen sweet-potato fries on the side, but sometimes, I find my body is craving more roughage and I prefer a salad on the side instead. \n There's a reason burritos with chips and salsa were my go-to lunch.\n When I was working at Trader Joe's, I'd often eat this exact meal on my lunch break. It has lots of staying power, so I'm full and energized for a long time.The bean-and-cheese burrito is an optimized meal on its own as it has carbohydrates (tortilla), protein and fiber (beans), and fat (cheese). From a gentle-nutrition perspective, the burrito would be filling by itself, but I find that it doesn't actually satisfy me unless I add something.It's important to remember that being full means your body got enough energy and nourishment from the meal, though being satisfied means the dish was fulfilling on an emotional and sensory level. If you don't consider your satisfaction, you'll find yourself still searching for more at the end of the meal, even if you're full.To increase the satisfaction of this eating experience, I add some crunchy tortilla chips and salsa, and sometimes avocado slices.\n Spaghetti, meatballs, and green beans can be a deeply comforting meal.\n As an intuitive eater, I ask myself what I can add to a meal to increase the satisfaction of the eating experience. In this case, I like incorporating a vegetable to contribute some freshness and contrast the rich flavors of the pasta and sauce.Adding a vegetable also gives this meal a little more fiber, which helps to slow the absorption of the food into your bloodstream, allowing you to extract more nutrients and feel full for longer. I also like adding grated Parmesan for extra fat.Although diet culture has taught many of us to fear fat, our bodies need it for several reasons, such as providing the body with energy and supporting cell function.Plus, fat contributes to the satisfaction of an eating experience. This meal has carbohydrates (pasta), protein (meatballs), fat (meatballs and cheese), and fiber (green beans).\n Soyaki tofu with rice and broccoli is perfect for busy weeknights.\n The Soyaki sauce from Trader Joe's pairs well with tofu and vegetables.\n For this dish, I typically let the tofu drain for at least 30 minutes to help get some of the water out so that it easily crisps in the pan.In a pan, heat up a bit of oil and brown your tofu on both sides. Then add your sauce — the Soyaki from Trader Joe's pairs well. Once the sauce thickens and your tofu pieces are coated in it, it's ready to serve.This microwave rice only takes three minutes to cook, making it perfect for busy weeknights. You can also roast fresh or frozen broccoli in the pan or sauté it on the stovetop.This meal covers carbohydrates (rice), protein (tofu), and fiber (broccoli) and has a little fat from the oil that the tofu is fried in. You could also add a drizzle of sesame oil or some avocado slices to increase the fat content and satisfaction of this meal.\n Frozen pizza with salad is an incredibly simple dish to prepare.\n I love having a fresh salad as a side dish when I eat pizza.\n When I lived in the diet mindset, I'd force myself to eat a salad with pizza because it made me feel less guilty. Since becoming an intuitive eater, I've realized I actually enjoy the experience of eating pizza and salad together.I love how the fresh greens contrast the richness of the cheese and dough and how the crunchy, hydrating mouthfeel of the lettuce goes along with the salty pizza.The fiber from the salad gives this meal more staying power, keeping you fuller for longer. The pizza contributes carbohydrates (dough) and fat and protein (cheese).The best part about this meal is that it couldn't be simpler to prepare — all you have to do is pop the pizza in the oven and mix the salad-kit components in a bowl.\n After working at Trader Joe's for three years, I can confidently say I've tried most items in the store, but I only recently felt called to try its many ravioli options. Turns out these ravioli are delicious and so easy to cook — they quickly became a part of my weeknight meal rotation.These ravioli offer carbohydrates (pasta) and some protein and fat (cheese filling). Texturally, it would be a little boring to eat a plain bowl of ravioli. I add sun-dried tomatoes, goat-cheese crumbles, and fresh arugula to make the meal more satisfying.The sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese compliment the flavors in the ravioli nicely while also adding unique textures. The arugula adds an element of freshness to contrast the more decadent pasta components.\n Mac and cheese with broccoli and chicken sausage is a delicious and filling option.\n As a dietitian, people are sometimes surprised that I eat Trader Joe's boxed mac and cheese.\n People are often surprised when they find out that I am a registered dietitian who eats boxed mac and cheese, but there is nothing wrong with consuming a packaged meal like this. The guilt that diet culture inflicts on you for consuming packaged or \"processed foods\" can be worse for your health than any food will ever be.When you experience guilt, your body goes into a stress response that increases your cortisol levels. If you are chronically feeling guilt or stress about your food choices, then your cortisol levels will be high, which can lead to various negative health outcomes, like blood pressure and fatigue.I love pairing this mac and cheese with some steamed or roasted broccoli because their heads soak up the cheese sauce like little sponges, which I find texturally appealing.Adding broccoli and chicken sausage gives the meal more fiber and protein, which optimizes the staying power of the meal.\n Trader Joe's Mandarin-orange chicken is high quality and easy to prepare.\n Trader Joe's frozen Mandarin chicken has been voted the favorite product from the store for years, and I can see why.It tastes like it could be from a restaurant and it's so easy to whip up on your own. I love how the tangy orange sauce coats the rice and broccoli when I mix it all up.This meal hits all the macronutrients, making it an optimized eating experience — carbohydrates (rice), protein (chicken) fat (chicken and oil it's fried in), and fiber (broccoli).\n Even though I've eaten meat for years, it sometimes feels intimidating to cook it at home. Luckily, preparing this chicken shawarma is so straightforward because the package says exactly how long to bake it in the oven. I love this chicken shawarma because it's already seasoned to perfection. I like to serve it shredded in a pita pocket with tons of toppings and sauces. I could see this going well with fresh onion, bell peppers, cucumbers, shredded romaine, tomatoes, feta, a drizzle of tahini, a scoop of hummus, olives, pickled cabbage, or tzatziki.This meal is also optimized — carbohydrates (pita), protein (chicken), fat (feta, tahini, and olives), and fiber (fresh vegetables). Click to keep reading Trader Joe's diaries like this one.","length":28684,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T15:08:20Z","rating":[8,7,8,6,7,7,6],"reason":"The article provides accurate meal ideas and nutritional information, drawing on the author's expertise as a dietitian.

Stowe","excerpt":"Plenty of movies have explicitly religious themes, but some of the most interesting examples of faith or transcendence on screen are much more subtle.","textContent":"In some movies, religion hits viewers over the head – including films that take home the industry’s biggest prizes. No one could miss religion’s importance in “The Exorcist” or “Jesus Christ Superstar,” both nominated for Oscars 50 years ago. Martin Scorsese, whose “Killers of the Flower Moon” is up for 10 at the 2024 Academy Awards, is working on a new project on the life of Jesus. \nAnyone can find a religious meaning in “Kundun,” Scorsese’s epic about the Dalai Lama’s youth, or “Fiddler on the Roof,” the story of life in a Russian Jewish shtetl at the turn of the 20th century. Cinematic Christ figures are a dime a dozen.\nBut for scholars of religion and popular culture like myself, movies that engage religion less directly are often more intriguing. \nTake the hugely influential science fiction franchise “The Matrix.” Depicting characters caught in a diabolical computer simulation, held prisoner to AI, the film feels particularly timely in 2024.\nSeeing past illusions to a deeper cosmic reality, as the film’s protagonists must do, is of course a theme of many faiths. “The Matrix” is peppered with many other allusions to religion and mythology. Main character Neo, referred to as “the One,” is killed and resurrected. A hacker even tells him, “You’re my savior, man, my own personal Jesus Christ.” One central character is named Trinity. Another is called Morpheus, after the Greek god of dreams.\n Carrie-Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves as Trinity and Neo in ‘The Matrix.’\nMore specifically, religion scholars see explicit themes of Gnosticism, a variant of Christianity that flourished during the faith’s first few centuries. A central focus of Gnostic texts is attaining liberation from worldly illusion through direct inner knowledge of truth. Its teachings include stark dualism – light vs. dark, mind vs. body, good vs. evil – and belief in a hidden God operating in a hostile cosmos, both of which have analogues in “The Matrix.”\nBuddhist themes are also unmistakable. The film begins with Neo waking up, both literally and figuratively, as he discovers the truth: Machines have trapped humanity in pods to harvest their energy. The world in which humans believe they are living is actually “the matrix,” an illusory world created to distract them.\n“Buddha” means “awakened one,” and many viewers have drawn comparisons between Keanu Reeves’ character’s journey and Buddhism. Once awakened to reality, Neo is no longer bound to the illusions of ignorance and desire. Just as importantly, he must help other humans awaken and escape the cycle of suffering.\nEven apart from specific allusions like these, cinema shares something important with religion. \nReligion scholar R. Brent Rodriquez-Plate argues that films can function something like religions in the lives of their audiences, “playing God” by creating imaginary worlds – worlds that may make viewers see their real lives in a different light.\n Visitors gaze at a clay model of Hayao Miyazaki’s film ‘Ponyo’ at an exhibition in Tokyo in 2008.\nThat power is nowhere more evident than in animated films, which create vivid realms that live action can only dream of. In films like “Spirited Away” and “Howl’s Moving Castle,” legendary anime director Hayao Miyazaki creates his own mythic worlds populated with fanciful “yōkai”: creatures that are inspired by Japanese legends but not quite Shinto or Buddhist.\nMany of Miyazaki’s films also include spirits that inhabit inanimate objects, which he associates with Japanese tradition. “In my grandparents’ time … it was believed that spirits (kami) existed everywhere – in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything,” he once said. “My own religion, if you can call it that, has no practice, no Bible, no saints, only a desire to keep certain places and my own self as pure and holy as possible.”\n“Princess Mononoke,” Miyazaki’s 1997 film set in medieval Japan, tells the story of a young prince drawn into an epic struggle between forest gods and humans who exploit natural resources. It’s a challenge religions have often ignored but are increasingly trying to engage: how to live responsibly in the natural world. \nWhile the movie has an environmental message, it avoids oversimplifying the struggle to “good nature” besieged by “bad humans.” San, a human girl who leads an army of wolves, tries to kill the prince, while Iron Town provides support for lepers and outcasts, even as it degrades the environment.\nWhat about comedy, though? Can a religious film be funny? Could a romantic comedy have religious overtones? \nEach February, many Americans celebrate Groundhog Day, waiting to see if the famous Punxsutawney Phil will see his shadow. But for some, Feb. 2 is a day to celebrate “Groundhog Day” – the film about the moral evolution of an arrogant Pittsburgh weatherman sent to report on the groundhog but forced to live the same day over and over again until he gets it right.\nGiven “Groundhog Day’s” cult-classic status, it evidently speaks to followers of many religions and none. But it’s hard to think of a film that better captures the concept of samsara: the Sanskrit term for the tedious human condition, with its endless cycles of birth and rebirth. Helping people find release from samsara is central to both Hinduism and Buddhism. Phil, the weatherman stuck reliving Feb. 2 over and over, is caught on such a treadmill. \nOnly by gradually transforming himself into a more virtuous person – performing acts of merit among the people of Punxsutawney – does he finally escape from the nightmare of recurring Groundhog Days.\nDirector Harold Ramis was brought up Jewish but became a Buddhist who carried a laminated card, “The 5 Minute Buddhist”: a kind of cheat sheet of core ideas of Buddhism. So it’s not surprising to find them in his movie.\nOne is “pratītyasamutpāda,” another Sanskrit term: the idea that everything in the cosmos is linked by causal chains. All causes and effects are connected; nothing stands wholly apart on its own. By the end of “Groundhog Day,” the prideful Phil has fully connected with people in the quaint Pennsylvania village – and won his love, Rita – having learned how his own well-being depends on the well-being of everyone around him. \nThere’s one more way to think about religion in film. Apart from specific spiritual themes, a powerful movie can offer an almost religious experience. \nNathaniel Dorsky, an experimental filmmaker influenced by Buddhism, writes of cinema as a devotional experience. The act of sitting in darkness, watching an illuminated world flicker by, Dorsky says, may be as close to approaching the transcendent as many of us will come – getting a glimpse of something beyond our normal range of experience.\nOf course, all these films can be enjoyed fully without reading them on this religious level. Some movie fans would object that these interpretations spoil the fun, and they may have a point. But part of the excitement of studying religion in popular culture is to be aware of its many permutations, hidden in plain view.","length":7689,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,8,9,7,8,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the intersection of religion and popular culture in films, citing examples like \"The Matrix,\" \"Princess Mononoke,\" and \"Groundhog Day.\" It maintains objectivity by presenting different perspectives on how religion is portrayed in these films and how viewers interpret them.

Beijing still refuses Taiwan visits by Chinese tour groups, and unilaterally altered flight routes over the Taiwan Strait, causing safety concerns.\n While fully booked tours of China could still go ahead between March 1 and May 31, from June 1, no Taiwanese groups can head for the other side of the Taiwan Strait, the Tourism Administration said Wednesday (Feb. 7).\n Tour operator associations visited the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) headquarters on Thursday to express their displeasure at the change, Radio Taiwan International (RTI) reported. Some travel agencies had already received deposits from travelers planning trips as far away as August.\n The tour operators also questioned the legal basis for the ban. The COVID-19 pandemic is over while sending travelers to China did not amount to investing in the country, so there did not appear to be a basis in law to stop the trips, the tour operators said.\n Before the pandemic, about a third of the 17 million overseas trips by Taiwanese had China as their destination, with tour groups occupying half the total. If there is a ban, many companies in the travel industry will find it hard to recover, while facing compensation claims from disgruntled customers.\n If the government does not provide a reasonable explanation for its change of heart, the tour operators said they might stage a protest on May 20, the day of President-elect Lai Ching-te’s (賴清德) inauguration, per CNA.\n The KMT accused the government of fooling voters ahead of the Jan. 13 presidential and legislative elections with its promise of opening group travel to China. Barely a month later, the Tourism Administration went back on its word, harming the local travel sector, opposition lawmakers said.","length":3048,"publishedTime":"2024-02-08 13:54:00","rating":[5,6,7,6,7,6,5],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the halt of tour groups to China by the Taiwanese government and includes statements from representatives of the travel sector and KMT lawmakers.

It’s too expensive to own investment properties here.”Doyle has hit back at Aussies who think landlords are just money-hungry Baby Boomers trying to squeeze as much cash as possible out of tenants.“We’re the ones being demonised. It’s unfair that the government is taxing my generation,” he said.Do you have a story to tell? Email me at stew.perrie@yahooinc.comDoyle’s property headache has been caused by the Victorian government’s COVID debt-repayment plan, which has seen homeowners hit with an average $1,300 extra in land tax after the tax-free threshold was cut from $300,000 to just $50,000.Nearly 400,000 property owners have been stung by this new plan, which is estimated to raise around $4.7 billion. Doyle reckons these fees, as well as others associated with owning a home, have cost him upwards of $100,000.Many landlords are ‘mum and dad’ investorsLandlords and tenants are often pitted against each other, but both face financial impacts from changing economic conditions.Improving the rights of Australian renters - who make up about a third of the population - has been at the core of the discussion, with many expressing they feel trapped with no power as property prices are pushed out of reach and rents hit record highs, while the number of available homes hit record lows.But landlords have been battered by the most aggressive interest-rate-hiking cycle in a generation.RELATED:Landlords' 'impossible' reality as record rents defendedRenter shocked by landlord's 'dodgy' moveLandlords are having a harder time than we thinkDomain’s chief of research and economics, Dr Nicola Powell, told Yahoo Finance the idea that the majority of landlords were sitting on huge property portfolios and raking in cash wasn’t quite right.“Australia's rental market is quite unique in the fact that the largest portion of rentals are provided really by mum and dad investors,” she said. “And these aren't mum and dad investors who have a giant portfolio. They may have one or two rental properties and the sensitivities to changes in interest rates are actually quite evident.“You can understand why we saw that trend of people having to offload an investment property and we know that type of investor is much quicker to offload an investment property than an owner-occupier is because, obviously, it's your primary place of residence.”The vast majority (71 per cent) of the 2.2 million landlords in the country own just one investment property, according to data from the Australian Tax Office. A further 19 per cent own two properties.Aussies have been told to go easy on landlords who might be struggling during cost of living pressures. (Source: Getty)Kochie begs Aussies to ditch the ‘greedy’ landlord imageDavid Koch believes landlords are being “unfairly targeted as the scapegoat” by angry Australians and has called on the public to put down their pitchforks.“You probably have one in your family, or among your friends, and I bet they have increased the rent to cover rising loan repayments,” the Compare the Market economic director said in an opinion piece for The Nightly.“But vilifying property investors is going to make the crisis a whole lot worse. The reality is many of those landlords are now saying it’s simply not worth it and are selling up, which just adds to the problem.”Kochie said the three levels of government had been “derelict in not foreseeing and planning to avoid this rental crisis” and he said there was “no silver bullet solution” to curtail rising rental payments.“They aren’t property moguls, they’re ordinary Australians trying to build a nest egg,” Koch said.Calls for a cap on rental pricesGreens MP Max Chandler-Mather is asking the government to introduce measures to cap rental prices and build more public housing while Aussies battle inflation and other cost-of-living pressures.During a passionate speech at the National Press Club, he said 30 per cent of the population rented and not enough was being done to make sure they could survive until the next paycheque.“This is such a serious crisis,” Chandler-Mather said. “And all we're doing is tinkering around the edges. What? More powerful property developers? Keep the tax handouts? Don't cap rents? Don't build any more public housing - or certainly not as much as the Greens are proposing?“I think, over the next few years, the entire political class is going to find out what happens when you ignore the one-third of this country getting screwed over by a housing system that funnels billions of dollars into the people that don't need it right now … the banks and property investors.”He accused property investors - who are expected to get “$39 billion in tax handouts this year” - of using “the capital gains tax discount to bid up the price of housing”.Chandler-Mather also used the address to announce a Greens plan that would see homes built and rented out below market prices to help struggling Aussies.","length":6012,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T01:31:37.000Z","rating":[5,6,7,4,5,6,5],"reason":"The article provides a firsthand account of a landlord's experience in Australia, shedding light on the challenges faced by property owners in the current economic climate.

Thompson\n          \n   \n            ProPublica","excerpt":"Commissioner Paul Graves’ collaboration with GOP leaders to block his own work is a local example of larger attacks on the Voting Rights Act.","textContent":"With the balance of power in Washington up for grabs, he launched a covert attack. He consulted powerful state Republicans. He reached out to national Republicans, including the most influential conservative redistricting lawyer in the country, to discuss funding a lawsuit and get strategic advice. He conferred with a Seattle law firm. And he found a Latino congressional hopeful to act as the face of the lawsuit.\nA countersuit was filed — against Graves’ own work. This suit made the opposite argument from the Latino group’s. Yes, the map that Graves and his fellow commissioners had created discriminated. But it had disadvantaged white people and other voters.\nSure enough, as Graves had foreseen, in August of last year the judge sided with the Latino plaintiffs. He determined the Yakima Valley map violated the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 civil rights law that has been the bedrock of voting discrimination cases for over half a century. Section 2 of the VRA prohibits the creation of election districts that deprive voters of color of their full rights. The judge said the maps needed to be redrawn.\nHaving handed Latinos a win, the judge tossed the lawsuit that Graves had helped generate as moot. Undeterred, the legal team of Benancio Garcia, the Latino congressional hopeful, appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to block the new maps until it had weighed the merits of his claim. The court declined to take the case earlier this month, and it is unclear whether lawyers will now appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nGraves told ProPublica he wanted legal action that would slow down the court because he believed the plaintiffs were about to push through “a naked partisan gerrymander.”\n“My singular goal, once a lawsuit was filed, was to defend the maps,” he said in a statement. His work is described in sworn depositions and court documents, including emails and other communications introduced as exhibits.\nThe Washington state salvo is merely one part of a yearslong national legal assault on laws and policies intended to prevent discrimination. In 2013, in a victory for right-wing activists, the conservative-majority Supreme Court overturned a key aspect of the VRA, lifting federal oversight over maps in areas that had historically discriminated against people of color. Last year, plaintiffs succeeded in getting the high court to make affirmative action illegal at private universities. Conservatives have also targeted school desegregation efforts and diversity initiatives at myriad organizations, including corporations and universities.\nThe activists are not done. By taking aim at the remaining pillar of the VRA, Section 2, they could substantially reshape U.S. elections. Despite a recent setback at the Supreme Court in an Alabama case, a sprawling, multipronged effort to get the high court to change course continues, supported by key national Republican figures. The Washington state case is one of 38 in 12 states that seek to roll back protections against discrimination by either attacking Section 2 directly or arguing that the constitutional protections of the 14th Amendment, which was passed after the Civil War and extended full citizenship rights to all Americans, trump Section 2.\nThe underlying premise animating these legal efforts is, in the famous words of Chief Justice John Roberts in another major ruling, that “the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.” The argument, which conservatives have been developing for years, flips what has been traditionally seen as the original intent of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Instead, they argue, the amendment can be read as prohibiting taking racial and ethnic composition into account — period. Section 2, however, requires states to ensure that voters of color are fairly represented.\nRepublicans say that these competing mandates confuse state legislators as they try to draw fair maps. Democrats are taking advantage of Section 2 to draw as many districts as possible that will elect Democrats, according to Adam Kincaid, who directs the National Republican Redistricting Trust and its nonprofit affiliate the Fair Lines America Foundation. “That was not what Congress intended and is not what the Constitution permits,” he said.\nVictory over Section 2 could stifle the voting power of nonwhite groups nationwide, striking fear in legal experts and activists who say that the country remains scarred by centuries of discrimination and racism.\n“Even after serious damage by the Supreme Court, the Voting Rights Act remains one of the country’s most effective civil rights statutes. Every attempt to limit its impact is really an attempt to limit our ability to protect against racial discrimination,” said Justin Levitt, a former Justice Department civil rights official who is now a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School.\nTracking the course of mapmaking fights is vital to understanding the likely results of the 2024 elections. In Washington state, where partisan gerrymandering is forbidden, Graves and his fellow Republican commissioner came to believe the Democratic members were pushing a map that was overly favorable for their party.\nAt issue was how to divide Yakima Valley, a rural area that’s home to many of the state’s vineyards and historically has voted Republican. In recent years, the Latino population in the valley has boomed.\nBy the Democrats’ read of Section 2, the commission was required to create a district that gave Latinos in Yakima a fair chance to elect the candidate of their choice. The commission couldn’t reach a consensus on whether it should hire a consultant to do a racial voting analysis, so Democrats hired their own. He concluded the district needed a 60% Latino voting population to comply with the VRA.\nMost Latino voters lean Democratic, so drawing such a map could diminish Republican political power.\nConcerned, Graves and another Republican member convinced Republicans in the state Senate to pay for an opinion from a Seattle law firm it used for legal work. It concluded that drawing lines to comply with Section 2 racial mandates could give grounds for a 14th Amendment lawsuit.\n“I don’t read Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to say one party gets to win over another,” Graves later testified.\nPartisan arguments dragged on during an all-night meeting the commission held on Nov. 15. Graves at one point asked Democrats what would be a “fair trade” if they got a majority Hispanic district in the Yakima Valley. If Republicans gave up voting strength there, he argued, the GOP should get an adjustment elsewhere.\nWith all of the haggling, the commission blew its midnight deadline but continued working through the night to reach an agreement that it could forward to the state Supreme Court. Worn down, Democrats finally agreed to the Republican proposals for the new 15th Legislative District.\nGraves was in charge of plugging final numbers into computer mapping software. Democrats later complained that his final map put the Latino voter percentage a tad lower than they had expected, at just over 50%. Graves said Democrats were consulted on every mapping adjustment.\nThe Washington Supreme Court allowed the commission’s work to stand despite its tardiness, and the maps were used in the 2022 elections.\nLatino plaintiffs filed the Section 2 lawsuit in January 2022. The commission was not a named defendant, but the panel’s work was at the heart of the case. All the commissioners were expected to be state witnesses.\nGraves and some other commissioners were upset when the office of the Democratic attorney general declined to defend the map and told the commission to hire its own attorney. Commission Chair Sarah Augustine resigned in March 2022, criticizing the state’s lack of legal support.\nGraves believed that the state’s refusal to defend the map could lead the judge to render a judgment that would invalidate the map, which would have been “a disaster,” he testified.\n“I was faced with the prospect of having to raise private funds to defend a public map,” he testified. Graves, a former lawmaker who ran the legal department of a trucking firm, urgently worked the phone. He got in touch with his state and national Republican contacts, including Kincaid, the director of the NRRT and its foundation, whom Graves had reached out to soon after his appointment. Graves said he wasn’t sure at first what the appropriate legal strategy should be, but he knew he had to move expeditiously.\nThrough a GOP contact, Graves connected with Garcia, an Iraq combat veteran and prominent Latino Republican who wanted to run for Congress. Garcia testified that they talked by phone about the map and whether it could be a “racial gerrymander” drawn to favor Latino Democrats. They discussed whether Garcia would quickly file a lawsuit challenging the map, and Graves connected him with two Seattle lawyers and Kincaid. Graves also urged him to bring on a national Latino GOP group as a co-plaintiff. (The group never signed on.)\nGraves emailed Garcia that Kincaid’s foundation “can serve as a funding vehicle for this work.” Kincaid declined to comment on foundation spending.\nAs a commissioner, state ethics rules restricted what Graves could share with outside parties about private commission deliberations. Plaintiffs’ lawyers introduced texts and emails that showed Graves guiding Garcia and questioned how Graves “found it appropriate — as a lawyer — to coordinate the filing of a lawsuit he believed to be meritless in order to interfere with a separate ongoing federal proceeding.”\nGraves called the accusations made by plaintiffs’ lawyers false and “scurrilous.”\nIn a statement, he told ProPublica his “singular goal, once a lawsuit was filed, was to defend the maps.”\nFor his part, Graves said he never believed his map was an illegal racial gerrymander, as Garcia’s lawsuit asserts. But Graves testified that he thought a 14th Amendment challenge “would at least meet the immediate goal” of delaying a default judgment.\nGarcia’s testimony was also damaging. He said in his deposition that he knew little about the case brought by Latino voters until he talked with Graves and that he rarely spoke with his own lawyers. Asked who was paying his legal fees, he could only say, “I don’t know.” The legal team Graves helped arrange included state Rep. Andrew Stokesbary, the new House minority leader and a friend of Graves, and the national law firm of Jason Torchinsky, the NRRT’s chief counsel and a leading GOP redistricting litigator.\nGarcia’s deposition harmed the suit so much that his lawyers later tried to have much of it corrected to reverse many of his assertions, including his testimony that his lawyers rarely talked with him. The judge would not allow the corrections.\nStokesbary, Torchinsky and Garcia did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nWhile the Garcia case was in motion, Stokesbary and Torchinsky agreed to represent three GOP intervenors in a parallel effort to derail the plaintiffs in the original case. This new effort sought to preserve the commission’s map. The intervenors, including a GOP lawmaker and the brother of an aide to a GOP redistricting commissioner, argued that Graves’ map did not violate Section 2 and no remedial map was needed.\nThe attorney general’s office asked the judge to investigate possible conflicts by Stokesbary and Torchinsky, who were representing clients arguing two opposite legal positions. As a leading Republican in the House, Stokesbary had voted to approve the plan Garcia was challenging. Plaintiffs’ lawyers argued that the conflicts traced back to Graves and his effort to “conjure up nonmeritorious and competing legal claims.” The judge allowed the attorneys to continue after their clients signed waivers.\nAfter a four-day trial, the judge ruled in August 2023 that the Yakima Valley map must be redrawn before the 2024 election. Then a three-judge panel said the decision in the case brought by Latino voters rendered the Garcia case moot.\nGraves took the stand during the trial and offered a convoluted defense. He described his fear that the commission’s map would be thrown out and his frantic effort to stop that. “I was trying to make sure the maps have a full-throated legal defense,” he testified.\nHe argued that the commission did not intentionally violate Section 2. The federal law, he said in a deposition, is “not crystal clear.”\nAs the battle against Section 2 has continued, Torchinsky has emerged as one of the most significant GOP lawyers in fights over election mapmaking.\nA fierce litigator, Torchinsky and his firm, Holtzman Vogel, have represented Republican congressional and Senate fundraising committees, the Republican National Committee and a long list of leading GOP candidates and PACs. In Texas, his efforts to shield Kincaid from demands that he give a deposition and produce documents in a Section 2 lawsuit brought by Latino plaintiffs dragged on for more than a year. An appeals court is still weighing GOP claims of legislative privilege in the case.\nIn Florida, Torchinsky worked for more than 100 hours with the staff of Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022 to create an alternate congressional redistricting map that would be more favorable to Republicans. A circuit court judge ordered the map redrawn, saying it diminished Black voting strength, but an appeals court overturned the decision. The Florida Supreme Court has said it will hear the case.\nThat same year, Torchinsky weighed in on a Section 2 case before the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that many legal experts expect to become the next Supreme Court showdown. The case involves a challenge from the Arkansas NAACP to the state’s 2021 redistricting plan. In a major ruling questioning decades of precedent, a three-judge panel said private parties lack standing to bring Section 2 lawsuits because the law gives enforcement power only to the U.S. attorney general.\nTorchinsky had filed a brief on behalf of GOP Sen. Tom Cotton arguing that the courts should not allow private parties to bring lawsuits. The law is specific, he said, and to “infer otherwise would be an act of judicial lawmaking incompatible with the power of the federal judiciary.”\nThe appeals court recently declined to rehear the case, and the Arkansas NAACP and other plaintiffs are weighing an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nTorchinsky’s clients had a setback in June 2023 when the Supreme Court issued an unexpected 5-4 decision upholding Section 2. The case involved a challenge to congressional maps brought by Black voters in Alabama. Representing the GOP congressional delegation in a solidly Republican state, Torchinsky urged justices to reverse the lower court’s order that the map be redrawn. “The Voting Rights Act was never intended to guarantee the success of one political party given the coincidence that the minority group prefers that political party,” he wrote.\nTorchinsky explained his reasoning a few weeks later in a podcast interview. He reflected a view shared by the NRRT’s Kincaid, who told ProPublica in a statement that lawyers for the left, funded by vast sums of “dark money,” are turning the VRA “into a vehicle to elect more Democrats rather than to elect minority candidates.”\nTorchinsky described the difficulties in many states of separating race and politics. As he put it, “When an African American can’t win a statewide election in Alabama, is it because they are Black? Or because they are running as a Democrat? And I think that is some of what the courts should be trying to untangle in these cases.”\nTorchinsky predicted “substantially more litigation” as state legislatures wrestle with tensions between Section 2 and the 14th Amendment.\nLevitt, the former Justice Department official, said several justices have clearly expressed opposition to Section 2, so Republican lawyers in recent years have been appealing any case that might raise a new issue and have a chance to win over the Court’s conservative supermajority.\n“You put enough bait in the ocean, and sometimes you catch a fish,” he said.\nThe remedial map-drawing process is close to completion in Washington, with a judge’s decision expected this month. A court-appointed special master is considering five possible fixes. Republican leaders have condemned all the plans as Democratic gerrymanders that could disrupt four to eight GOP districts and change the election districts of hundreds of thousands of residents.\nIn recent months, GOP state Sen. Nikki Torres has joined the lawsuit brought by Latino voters as a third party with a personal stake in the outcome, arguing that the maps do not need to be redrawn to give Latinos a greater voice. She won election as the first Latina senator from Central Washington in 2022 with about 68% of the vote under the 15th District map drawn by the commission.\nPlaintiffs’ lawyers consider her entry into the case just another delaying tactic that, if successful, will leave challenged maps in place for the 2024 election cycle.\nErnest Herrera, of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said: Lawyers for the intervenors are “trying every way they can to delay the Latino plaintiffs from having a map in which they can elect or have the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.”\nThis story was originally published on Feb. 28, 2024, by ProPublica.","length":17568,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[5,6,7,6,6,5,4],"reason":"The article provides a detailed account of the complex dynamics surrounding the Washington redistricting process, detailing the involvement of various political actors and the legal battles that ensued.

I hope this gives the foreign ministers convening in Rio de Janeiro a reason to reflect on what their countries have or have not done to stop this.\nTo say that the war in Gaza is pitiless and is an example of utter humanitarian failure is not news. There is no need to restate the obvious. Instead, allow me – on behalf of my humanitarian colleagues – to warn you not just about today but what I fear for tomorrow.\nWhat has been unfolding in Gaza for the past 138 days is unparalleled in its intensity, brutality and scope. Tens of thousands of people killed, injured or buried under the rubble. Entire neighbourhoods razed to the ground. Hundreds of thousands of people displaced, living in the most abject conditions even as winter sets in. Half a million people on the brink of famine. No access to the most basic needs: food, water, health care, latrines. An entire population is being stripped of its humanity.\nThe atrocities befalling the people of Gaza – and the humanitarian tragedy they are enduring – are there for the world to see, documented by brave Palestinian journalists too many of them have been killed while doing so. No one can pretend not to know.\nNo one can pretend not to know either that humanitarian agencies are doing their best: Nearly 160 of our colleagues have been killed, yet our teams continue to deliver food, medical supplies and safe drinking water. We are doing everything we can, despite the security risks, the collapse of law and order, the access constraints and the personal tragedies. Despite the defunding of the largest UN organisation in Gaza. And despite the deliberate attempts to discredit us.\nThe humanitarian community which I represent has just released a plan outlining what we need to increase the flow of aid into and across Gaza. None of it is unreasonable: security guarantees; a better humanitarian notification system to reduce risks; telecommunication equipment; removal of unexploded ordnance; use of all possible entry points.\nBut although I have often said that hope is the currency of the humanitarian, I have little hope that the authorities will give us what we need to operate. I want nothing more than to be proven wrong.\nWe know without a shadow of a doubt that humanitarian agencies will be blamed – we are already being blamed – for the lack of aid in Gaza, despite the courage, commitment and sacrifice of all our teams there.\nBut make no mistake: The deprivations that the people of Gaza have been enduring are so severe that no amount of aid is enough.\nThe obstacles we are facing every step of the way are so enormous that we can only provide the bare minimum.\nThe October 7 attacks on Israel are horrific – I have condemned them repeatedly and will continue to do so. But they cannot justify what is happening to every single child, woman and man in Gaza.\nSo my message to the G20 foreign ministers this week is clear: We have been pleading with Israel, as the occupying power in Gaza, to facilitate aid delivery – to little or no avail.\nWe have been calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages – to little or no avail.\nWe have been urging the parties to abide by their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law – to little or no avail.\nWe have been exhorting countries which have stopped funding UNRWA to reverse their decision – to little or no avail.\nToday, we implore you, G20 members, to use your political leadership and influence to help end this war and save the people of Gaza. You have the power to make a difference. Use it.\nYour silence and lack of action will only lead to more women and children thrown into the open graves of Gaza.\nThe views expressed in this article are the author’s own and do not necessarily reflect Al Jazeera’s editorial stance.","length":4222,"publishedTime":"2024-02-21T13:00:47Z","rating":[8,7,8,7,8,7,8],"reason":"The article scores high on accuracy as it presents factual information about the situation in Gaza and the efforts of humanitarian agencies.

Ministers exchanged their views on the basis of a document prepared by the Belgian presidency. The main points of discussion were the choice of the legal instrument (directive or regulation) and the binding 30 day payment periods (whether they should be fixed or adapted to the situations in which businesses operate).\nThe late payment regulation proposal is part of the ‘SME relief package’, a series of initiatives presented by the Commission on 12 September 2023 to address the main needs of small and medium enterprises in the current economic environment.\nThe legal text proposed by the Commission changes the current legislation (late payment directive) into a regulation and addresses the current shortcomings, including the lack of sufficient preventive measures and suitable deterrents whose enforcement and redress mechanisms are insufficient.\n European Commission proposal of a regulation on combating late payment in commercial transactions\nMinisters held an exchange of views on the 2024 annual single market and competitiveness report (ASMCR) which was published by the Commission on 14 February. The annual single market and competitiveness report responds to a request of the March 2023 by the European Council to monitor the state of the single market and its competitiveness. Compared with previous editions, this year’s report includes new competitiveness indicators, in line with the 2023 Commission’s communication: ‘Long-term competitiveness of the EU: looking beyond 2030’. The report analyses the situation of the single market based on the nine competitiveness areas: the functioning of the single market, access to private capital, public investment and infrastructure, research and innovation, energy, circularity, digitalisation, education and skills, and trade and open strategic autonomy.\nThe discussion was structured around a paper prepared by the Belgian presidency which invited ministers to reflect on four topics: main drivers for competitiveness, how to improve the ASMCR in the future (i.e. with new key performance indicators), how to strengthen the EU's open strategic autonomy without creating distortions in the single market, and main objectives of the single market enforcement taskforce (SMET).\nThe presidency informed member states about the state of play of the different legislative initiatives that are currently under discussion. In particular, the presidency debriefed ministers on the state-of-play regarding three important proposals:\n Council and Parliament strike a deal to ban products made with forced labour (press release, 5 March 2024)\n Corporate sustainability due diligence: Council and Parliament strike deal to protect environment and human rights (press release, 14 December 2023)\n SMEI / IMERA: Council and Parliament strike a provisional deal on crisis preparedness (press release, 1 February 2024)\nThe presidency and the Commission informed ministers about the progress on the ‘European agenda for tourism 2030’ and the informal council of tourism ministers that the Belgian presidency held in Louvain-la-Neuve on 19-20 February.\nThe German, Dutch, Danish, Spanish, Finnish and Portuguese delegations informed ministers about the need to update the strategy for the maritime sector at the European level. The current strategy, the so-called ‘LeaderSHIP 2020’, was adopted in response to the economic crisis in the shipbuilding sector in 2013 and has not been changed since. Germany and the Netherlands called on the Commission to publish a new maritime strategy and asked the Belgian presidency to consider the specific needs of the maritime industry in the forthcoming draft Council conclusions on industrial policy.\nAt the request of the Swedish delegation and 10 other member states, ministers were informed about the impact of state-aid rules for long-term competitiveness. The Swedish delegation proposed a long-term approach to state-aid instead of the current short-term relaxation measures.\nAt the request of the French delegation, ministers had a point in the agenda about ways in which to improve the security of medicines supply in the EU. The French delegation pointed out  that Europe is highly dependent on imports of critical medicines manufactured in Asia, as revealed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The delegation stated that, on 2 May 2023, 22 member states signed a non-paper highlighting the need to improve the security of medicines supply in Europe, by promoting a legislative initiative in the form of a ‘critical medicines act’ in order to strengthen Europe's production capacities as well as Europe’s resilience and strategic autonomy.\nDuring lunch, ministers held a debate on the future of EU’s industrial policy, The debate was framed by a note prepared by the presidency in which ministers were invited to consider the sectors in which the EU already has a competitive advantage, as well as the key indicators used to identify them.\n‘Strengthening our competitiveness’ is one of the six priorities of the Belgian presidency. It calls on the EU to prioritise its long-term competitiveness and industrial policies, in a changing world with new geopolitical realities and disruptive technologies, such as artificial intelligence. One of the specific outcomes of this priority will be the adoption of the Council conclusions on the future of EU industrial policy in the COMPET Council of 24 May. The exchange of views during the lunch will feed into the debate on the future of EU industrial policy and will contribute to these Council conclusions.","length":8541,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,6,6,8,7,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed overview of the discussions and exchanges that took place during the Competitiveness Council meeting on 7 March 2024.

That play, set in the awful clench of Reagan and AIDS, is haunted by older matters—Bolshevik revolution, pogroms, and the government purges of 1950s McCarthyism. The new mini-series Fellow Travelers (Showtime, October 29) brings the latter era to the foreground, as two men begin an affair while perilously close to, well, the sinister ministrations of Roy Cohn.The series is based on the novel by Thomas Mallon, which spans decades but mostly stays zoomed in on the scary persecutions of Joseph McCarthy. Hawkins Fuller (Matt Bomer) is a suave, handsome, war-hero Washington wheel-greaser, an eligible bachelor who prefers to spend his private time having rough sex (he’s always the dom) with men he meets at gay speakeasies and other cruising spots. He’s quite good at living a secret life, though of course a certain amount of recklessness is always in play.Hawk is a good enough mentor to wide-eyed Tim Laughlin (Jonathan Bailey), a devoutly Catholic rube from the Midwest who wholeheartedly supports anti-Communist efforts and, through Hawk’s help, finds himself working for McCarthy. As their career positions grow ever more compromised, the two men begin a lusty, push-and-pull affair; Hawk is the pragmatic, emotionally distant foil to Tim’s earnest longing. Though we watch as Hawk and Tim move from the furtively carnal toward something like a genuine relationship, the show’s multiple-timeline device tells us pretty early on that this relationship does not endure. In the 1980s, Hawk is in a long marriage to a senator’s daughter while Tim is dying of AIDS in San Francisco.Fellow Travelers is a weepy, a star-crossed love story about people torn asunder by forces political and personal, by shame and fear and stubbornness. As the series unfolds, the intriguing Washingtonian-thriller trappings of early episodes—notes covertly passed, betrayals done out of ruthless self-preservation—give way to more familiar, plodding melodrama. Creator Ron Nyswaner expands the scope of the story beyond that of the novel, reaching to incorporate a whole history of gay struggle as the movement lurches its way to the progresses of the 1990s and 2000s, amidst the bitter devastation of a plague.Worthy as those topics are, they feel tacked onto what might otherwise be a shrewd, sad story of head and heart at war during a charged American moment, a sort of gay Graham Greene tale. Had Fellow Travelers not felt the urge to coax the easiest won tears out of its audience, its characters might have maintained more specificity, more intricate depth. Instead the series gradually flattens these men into clichés: Hawk is the tragic old-schooler who only accepts himself when it is too late, Tim the younger idealist who becomes a martyr to the cause. We come to bitterly miss the cold savvy of the series’s beginning, the moody mid-century air of suspense and high-wire discretion.What is constant throughout is the sex, which Fellow Travelers presents in blunt abundance. A clear power dynamic is established in the many scenes of Hawk and Tim in the heat of passion—one that should be more palpable in the scenes in which they’re clothed. Other lovers enter the picture, particularly during a fraught expedition to 1970s Fire Island, but Hawk and Tim are at the white hot center of the show’s depiction of gay male sexuality. (Which involves a perhaps anachronistic amount of pecs and abs.) It’s appreciated that the show goes there, but these scenes also act in strange discord with the mushier, blander aspects of the series. The show clearly wants to confront the audience with something real and visceral, but then it swings wildly back to broad sentimentalism and didactic point-making.It’s an imbalanced series, one trying to do too much at once. The show attempts to diversify its purview by introducing a side plot involving an ambitious Black reporter, Marcus (Jelani Alladin), contending with D.C. racism and some of his own femme-phobia as he falls for a drag performer, Frankie (Noah J. Ricketts). That’s an interesting story to tell, but can only get so much attention when Hawk and Tim are occupying most of the narrative space. Similarly, Hawk’s wife, Lucy (Allison Williams), is given focus toward the end of the series, but that feels like too little too late—if she was going to be a major player in the story, her perspective needed to be introduced sooner.All the actors involved do their best to flesh out what the writing doesn’t. Bomer is particularly striking, using his matinee-idol looks to both seduce and repulse. He’s slickly convincing as a shifty political operator, even when he has to say clunky lines like, “Looks like I finally have a date with Mr. Right. Or should I say, Mr. Right Wing.” Bailey is tasked with mapping Tim’s shift from dutiful conservative to lefty radical, forever contending with his compromised faith. The writing renders Tim too nice, too besotten, too unquestionably good to be a terribly interesting character, but Bailey at least sells the sweetness of first love and the hurt of its ending.

Directness isn't just about punching holes because if we do that into a white wall, we'll be going backwards.\"England, by contrast, still look uncertain in their game management for all their side features experienced campaigners in captain Jamie George, as well as fly-half George Ford.Red Rose boss Steve Borthwick has given a first Test start to Immanuel Feyi-Waboso but doubts remain over whether the rest of a side featuring fit-again scrum-half Alex Mitchell and a reshuffled shuffled pack, with Ollie Chessum moving from lock to blindside flanker, can get the ball to the 21-year-old wing in an attacking position.\"This is a team that is growing fast,\" said England coach Borthwick, who insisted they had learned from their Murrayfield mistakes as he lauded Ireland.\"We know we're going against the world's best team right now but I also think that's a challenge the players are relishing. \"I've seen the England team in recent times going into situations where the opposition were fancied ahead of us and I've seen them jump at the challenge and I sense that from them now.\"","length":4874,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T04:33:07+00:00","rating":[7,8,8,6,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the upcoming Six Nations clash between Ireland and England, covering details about the teams, key players, and their form in the tournament.

It was a massive moment for the New Zealand cricket team as Kane Williamson and Tim Southee featured in the 100th Test match of their careers, and also walked out onto the pitch with their kids ahead of the first session. The Black Caps are currently hosting Australia in a two-match Test series, with the second fixture having begun on Friday in Christchurch. Josh Hazlewood spoiled Kane Williamson's party. Both veterans walked out, carrying their children. Meanwhile, Williamson received a standing ovation by the Hagley Oval crowd but failed to live up to the expectations. The batter was dismissed cheaply, registering only 17 off 37 balls. Receiving a full delivery by Josh Hazlewood, in the middle, Williamson played down the wrong line to get hit on the pads and the umpire gave him LBW.

Mitchell Starc was also in good form and took three wickets. Meanwhile, Southee showed some good batting form in his 100th Test.

Dubai's long-term participation is one of the major topics up for discussion. According to sources, a vote is expected to determine their entry into next year's competition. The most likely scenario involves the new team in Dubai starting from the EuroCup in the upcoming 2024-25 season. This period is seen as a potentially transitional year to prepare for the team's EuroLeague debut in the following 2025-26 season. The meeting in Barcelona is not expected to discuss other potential EuroLeague wild cards for the immediate future, as these discussions are anticipated to occur in the next meetings. Partizan's General Manager, Zoran Savic, actively building its case for a long-term license for Belgrade's team, previously indicated that such discussions might occur in April. Another central question concerns the continuity of Paulius Motiejunas in his role as CEO. There is an expectation that EuroLeague shareholders will aim to define his long-term future in this position. Motiejunas and EuroLeague president Dejan Bodiroga were appointed to be in charge of the competition for a one-year agreement. Motiejunas, after assuming the role, expressed his intention to introduce the CEO's tenure and terms to ensure stability in the crucial managing position of the EuroLeague. While the specific project defining the term for the CEO's position remains unclear, it is anticipated that Motiejunas will continue, given the satisfaction of most shareholders with his work this season, sources tell BasketNews. Motiejunas' success in uniting EuroLeague shareholders and gaining their trust has been highlighted as a significant achievement. This cohesion is crucial for establishing consistent leadership moving forward, particularly in light of expansion and impending IMG contract negotiations, with the current deal expiring in 2026. Furthermore, the shareholders are expected to be introduced to the idea of presenting Abu Dhabi as a potential host for the EuroLeague Final Four for three consecutive years. With Berlin confirmed to host the EuroLeague Final Four in 2024, the hosts for the following events remain unclear. EuroLeague is also set to discuss the latest developments in the ongoing discussions with FIBA regarding potential closer cooperation, including the EuroCup and Basketball Champions League merger. In addition to the main topics, the meeting is expected to address other internal regulation processes that have been under consideration for an extended period. One such consideration is a financial fair play project that could potentially implement so-called luxury tax rules in the future. Midway through the season, Motiejunas mentioned that he wants to approve the financial fair play guidance and provide clear directions already this season, aiming to allow clubs more time to prepare for its establishment in the coming years.

Indians from the country’s vast northeast region, which borders China, Bangladesh and Myanmar, may appear more east Asian than their compatriots elsewhere.\n Hsu’s remarks have been criticized by lawmakers from both the ruling and opposition parties in Taiwan. On Monday, the island’s foreign ministry expressed its “sincere apologies over this situation.”\n “Taiwan will welcome any Indian worker who meets conditions for recruitment and satisfies industry demand, regardless of their ethnic background,” the ministry said in a statement.\n In a separate apology, Taiwan’s labor ministry said Hsu implied “absolutely no discriminatory connotation when she mentioned ‘similar skin color’ in the interview. ”\n “Taiwan respects India’s diverse and rich culture and will use this as a basis in the future to promote labor cooperation between the two sides,” it added.\n CNN has reached out to India’s Ministry of External Affairs for comments.\n Hsu’s remarks come at a time when business ties between New Delhi and the democratically-governed island are warming up. Taiwan’s Foxconn, one of Apple’s largest suppliers, has been expanding its operations in India after suffering severe supply disruptions in China during Covid lockdowns.\n “India is a country with a large population,” Young Liu, the company’s chairman and CEO, said after visiting India last year. “My trip this week supported Foxconn’s efforts to deepen partnerships … and seek cooperation in new areas such as semiconductor development and electric vehicles.”\n Liu was awarded the Padma Bhushan, one of India’s highest civilian awards, earlier this year.\n In February, Taiwan said it will hire migrant workers from India to ease its labor shortage, but did not share any other details.\n Like its East Asian neighbors — including China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea — the island has a stubbornly low birth rate.\n Known for producing advanced semiconductors, Taiwan is projected to become a “super aged” society by 2025, with elderly people accounting for more than 20% of the total population, according to a forecast by its economic planning agency.\n By 2028, the working age population, defined as people between the ages of 15 and 64, will account for less than two thirds of the total population, the agency said.\n But hiring foreign workers in large numbers may not be easy. In November, Bloomberg reported that Taiwan could “hire as many as 100,000 Indians to work at factories, farms and hospitals.”\n That report, which cited unnamed sources, triggered heated online debate among Taiwanese, with some racist comments being shared.\n Taipei currently allows migrant workers from Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines to work in the island, according to the labor ministry.","length":4344,"publishedTime":"2024-03-05T11:31:09.665Z","rating":[2,5,6,4,7,5,4],"reason":"The article is rated low on accuracy as it highlights the controversial comments made by Taiwan's labor minister, which have been met with criticism and led to apologies from the government.

She emphasizes the significance of psychological safety and suggests that establishing open dialogue requires skilled leadership, both in formal and informal communication channels.  While stress is a normal reaction to excessive work, Dr. Pennie Blackburn points out that it’s important for the maritime industry to take care of its seafarers by reducing stress and fatigue as much as possible. She suggests that using stress risk assessments can help companies strike a balance. This means helping people develop healthy ways to deal with stress while also tackling the reasons why they are feeling stressed in the first place.SAFETY4SEA: From your perspective, what should be industry’s key priorities for healthy living while onboard?Pennie Blackburn: I advocate for good communication between shoreside and seafarers. During Maritime Mental Health Awareness training, the conversations that shoreside and seafaring staff have about their respective roles in crew wellbeing are enormously fruitful. Seafarers identify the challenges they face and what they need, it’s often simple things like tasty food and timely supply of spares, but there seems little opportunity within routine operations for these conversations to take place. Consultation with seafarers improves perception of a culture of care. Of course, this does need some action responses for it to be effective, but active consultation with seafarers would be a great start. At Waypoint Maritime CiC, a not-for-profit organisation for maritime mental health, we offer assistance to evaluate wellbeing risks within the organization’s specific operational context and provide customised recommendations based on this assessment.S4S: What are your suggestions to minimize health related issues and improve occupational conditions among seafarers, enhancing their mental wellness? Do you think there is need for regulatory update or best practices?P.Bl.: The consideration of mental health into the regulations is very topical. A good principle is to aim for parity of mental health with existing physical health provisions. Although Title 4 of the MLC does already apply to mental as well as physical health, I would advocate for simple clarification of this, within the primary regulations. Whilst regulations ensure minimum standards, they may not promote optimal conditions on board.  Guidelines that collate successful initiatives from the industry, those that make a tangible difference to seafarer wellbeing and demonstrate a return on investment, could incentivise a race to the top. Ideally a nuanced regulatory approach that combines minimum standards with aspirational best practice could drive a collective effort to enhance industry standards and continuous improvement, wherein companies are not just meeting minimum requirements but are motivated to excel.S4S: In your view, has the industry handled the Mental Wellness effectively so far? What needs to be further done to support the mental dimension of wellbeing?P.Bl.: The crew change crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic was a catalyst for interest in and awareness of the unique challenges of life at sea. While this is praiseworthy, responses have been varied. All too often we see industry reinventing solutions. I would urge all stakeholders in the maritime industry to treat mental health and wellbeing with the same rigorous due diligence as other areas of operational and safety management. As a minimum:  Safeguard the principle of Do-No-Harm.Collaborate with an accredited mental health professional to ensure expertise from both mental health and maritime are combined. This will ensure that initiatives are both safe and effective.Always check the credentials of consultants and service providers to ensure they have appropriate skills. Ask them to provide details of their qualifications, professional accreditation, and critically legal liability insurance.It can be challenging for industry partners to know which services and providers represent best practice in the field of mental health. At Waypoint Maritime CiC, a not-for-profit organisation for maritime mental health, our mission is to support the maritime industry, navigate these complexities.S4S: Collaboration is the new fuel: How can industry stakeholders best collaborate in support of mental wellness? What is your advice?P.Bl.: I am a huge advocate of collaboration; the best ideas often come from sharing diverse knowledge and experience. At Waypoint Maritime CiC, we aim to work alongside industry experts to leverage professional expertise in mental health and wellbeing to adapt what we know works in promotion, prevention, and response to fit within the unique context of the maritime industry. The exchange of challenges, insights, and successful initiatives amongst stakeholders, be they seafarers and their professional bodies, shipowners, operators, welfare support organisations or mental health professionals, are an exciting way to collate best practice guidelines. Waypoint Maritime CiC has an open invitation for all industry partners to work with us and we would be delighted to host best practice seminars in a spirit of continuous learning.S4S: Why is psychological safety considered vital in the maritime sector? How can the maritime industry prioritize psychological safety to create a work environment where individuals feel safe to express themselves?P.Bl.: The reporting of safety concerns, near misses as well as issues of wellbeing all rely on a culture in which everyone is able to speak up or speak out. Assertiveness, saying something which might be considered criticism or raising concerns about unsafe situations, and problems is vital to safe operations. Different cultures have varying norms and communication styles that impact how people express themselves in the workplace, particularly within a strict hierarchical structure. Psychological safety is not something that can be taught, imposed, or mandated; it’s an outcome or a metric which points to the culture of a company and the vessel. Establishing a culture in which open dialogue is encouraged, requires skillful leadership on board, options for formal and informal channels of communication and company policies which not only assure people that no negative repercussions will follow; but also demonstrates the value that raising concerns add to improving safety and wellbeing.S4S: According to studies, fatigue and stress are considered as major areas of concern with regards to seafarers’ health. What is your feedback? How can we address these issues to support seafarers’ wellness?P.Bl.: With stress linked to various physical and mental health problems, reported average levels of stress among seafarers is concerning. Studies also indicate that about 66% of people with a diagnosable mental health problem believe that work related stress contributed. Imagine what proportion we could prevent if we addressed the causes of stress. Promoting good coping skills and strategies is valuable, Waypoint Maritime offers training and other services for this purpose. However, it’s important to remember that stress is a normal response to excessive demands or perceived threat. It’s crucial for the industry to exercise duty of care through mitigating the causes of stress and fatigue wherever practicable. The stress risk assessments we offer can support companies to achieve this balance. A balanced approach, cultivating good coping skills combined with addressing the root causes is key to an effective strategy.  S4S: What is your key message to industry stakeholders and people onboard to foster their resilience?P.Bl.: Seafarers are professional problem solvers, often demonstrating considerable resilience. This can mean it’s hard for seafarers to acknowledge they are also human and recognise that life stress and operational demands can take their toll. If we remember that we all have limits, then we look at what conditions support seafarers to thrive on board. From what seafarer’s tell me, operational demands seem to keep increasing with less and less opportunity for rest, recuperation, social interaction, and shore leave and that living and recreational facilities and spaces on board have been progressively sacrificed to maximize cargo space and prioritise efficiency and productivity. To remain sustainable, we also need to prioritise crew welfare and wellbeing. There is plenty of evidence in other sectors that a focus on staff wellbeing delivers considerable return on investment, so a balanced approach can be a win-win.The views presented are only those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of SAFETY4SEA and are for information sharing and discussion purposes only.","length":9004,"publishedTime":"2024-03-06T09:43:49+00:00","rating":[8,9,7,6,7,8,7],"reason":"- The article scores high in Accuracy as it provides insights from Dr. Pennie Blackburn, a Consultant Clinical Psychologist, directly, ensuring the information is credible.

Ironically, they still believe, deep in their hearts, that even in 2024 where social media rules the world, they can push their narrative onto others, no matter how silly it sounds.\nTake this example: Nara Lokesh, who is number 2 in the Telugu Desam Party and has raised a formidable force within the party, was absent at the TDP-Janasena big event last night.\nIt’s understandable that the event belongs to Pawan Kalyan and Janasena, and as expected, Pawan Kalyan stole the limelight, though Chandrababu Naidu was next to him.\nIt was a conscious decision on Lokesh’s part to stay away from this event to give all the space to Pawan Kalyan. In fact, though Pawan attended the Yuvagalam wrap-up ceremony, he graciously let Lokesh take over the entire event as it was his day.\nBlue media cooked up a humorous story on why Lokesh is absent. They wrote that it was Pawan Kalyan’s demand to Chandrababu that Lokesh should not be at the event, and Babu agreed to the demand because he does not want to upset Pawan.\nThe reason they painted was because of Pawan’s demand; he only wants to share the stage with Chandrababu because in the past, when the media asked, Lokesh clarified that Chandrababu would be the CM when the alliance forms the government. How does this make any sense? If Pawan is upset with Lokesh saying his father will be CM, why would he agree to 24 seats? In fact, the way Pawan Kalyan spoke highly about Chandrababu will be hard to digest for YCP supporters.\nSo they want everyone to believe that Pawan is ready to work with TDP and Chandrababu, and agreed to contest in 24 seats, but he does not want to see Lokesh?

The last time NC State scored 10 runs or more in three straight games came in a stretch of five such games from Feb. 22-26, 2022.\nNC State baseball third baseman Alec Makarewicz has been on a tear since joining the Wolfpack for his final collegiate season, leading the Pack with 24 RBI, 39 total bases, 19 hits and 10 extra-base hits. A-Mak earned ACC Player of the Week honors this past week after batting .455 with a team-high 10 hits, four doubles, 13 RBI, 20 total bases and six extra-base hits. The third baseman ranked second nationally this past week with 13 RBI and tied for second nationally with four doubles. Makarewicz ranks fourth nationally in RBI (24) and second nationally in RBI per game (2.18).\nNC State showed patience at the plate all weekend long against Towson, drawing 34 walks over its four-game sweep. The Wolfpack logged 16 of those walks in one game, notching a 16-4 win in game one of Saturday's doubleheader behind 16 free passes. The Wolfpack's 16 walks in a single game were the most since March 30, 2007, when NC State drew 16 walks in a 24-4 win at Boston College.\nThe Wolfpack pitching staff also allowed just eight walks over four games this past weekend, not allowing a free pass in back-to-back victories to conclude the series.\nOnce again the Wolfpack sported an impressive record when it outhit its opponents in 2023, finishing the year with a 28-7 when it recorded more hits than the opposing team. The Wolfpack is 7-1 in games this season when its outhit its opponent.\nSince 2017, NC State now is 202-24 (.894) when it has outhit its opponent.\nWelcome to our house. Doak Field at Dail Park has served as a dominant home field advantage for the Wolfpack since 1966. In 2023, the Pack finished with a 26-7 record at The Doak. Since head coach Elliott Avent returned to Raleigh to take over the #Pack9 program in 1997, NC State has posted a 607-226 (.729) record in games played at Doak Field at Dail Park. NC State has won 20 or more games at the Doak 21 times since Avent's first year as head coach in 1997.","length":6122,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[5,6,7,6,7,7,6],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the upcoming ACC baseball series between NC State and Boston College, including game schedules, player matchups, historical series results, and team statistics.

(courtesy: YouTube)Kiran Rao returns to the director's seat well over a decade after her debut film, Dhobi Ghat (2011), with a work that strikes the right notes. She does away with marquee names in Laapataa Ladies, produced by Aamir Khan Productions in association with Kindling Pictures, and employs three first-timers in a lively tale of two brides caught in a terrible mix-up.Laapataa Ladies puts hinterland women front and centre and makes its points about gender equality unambiguously. The screenplay is, however, neither screechy nor shrill. It may not be entirely subtle about what it is driving at, but it does not overplay its hand in any manner.Two newly married village girls who find themselves in a serious crisis. It isn't of their making. In looking for an end to their troubles, they learn, each in her own way, that there are ways to dispel the darkness around them.It is 2001. In fictional Nirmal Pradesh, two brides, on their way home with their respective husbands, get swapped in a passenger train. In the unsettling but life-altering chaos that ensues, they discover themselves and are never the same again.Phool Kumari (Nitanshi Goel), barely out of her teens, is left stranded at a railway station when her husband Deepak (Sparsh Shrivastav) alights from the train holding the hand of another man's identically attired and veiled bride (Pratibha Ranta) travelling in the same compartment.When Deepak reaches his village home with the woman who is not his wife, he and his family are confronted with the repercussions of the embarrassing slip-up. The bride introduces herself as Pushpa Rani. Deepak has no clue where Phool, the girl he married, has disappeared.He and his mates search high and low for the missing bride over the next few days. They lodge a complaint at the local police outpost but Inspector Shyam Manohar (Ravi Kishan) is not a man given to swinging into action. If anything, he only aggravates matter.Pushpa, on her part, does not appear overly bothered that she isn't where she should be. She even begins to develop a bond with two women in the family - Deepak's mother Yashoda (Geeta Agrawal Sharma) and his sister-in-law Poonam (Rachna Gupta). And thereby lies a tale that contains the seeds of a rebellion.Phool and Pushpa (both are Hindi words for flower) are temperamentally different. The former is grief-stricken, a bit of a babe in the woods who cannot even name the village she was headed to. The latter has her wits about her. She makes the most of the freedom that a home where she does not belong unintentionally grants her. Pushpa is a bride without the attendant shackles because she isn't in the right place.For poor little Phool, left to fend for herself in an unfamiliar, even perhaps unsafe, place, surviving in one piece is a challenge. She finds help in the form of a chirpy Chhotu (Satendra Soni), who does odd jobs for a rail platform tea and snacks kiosk run by the feisty Manju Maai (Chhaya Kadam).Manju Maai, who has rid herself of an alcoholic husband and a parasitic son and has no qualms about it, takes Phool under her wings and begins to impress upon her the importance of not letting matrimony become a millstone around a girl's neck.The contrast may seem a touch contrived at first flush. But look deeper and the two incipient mutinies, one by a woman who has a reason, the other by an ingenue who has no option, begin to make sense. The lost ladies are two facets of assertion in the face of a grave crisis.Adapted from a story by Biplab Goswami and scripted by Sneha Desai (who has also written the dialogues with additional inputs from Divyanidhi Sharma), Laapataa Ladies is a social satire with a pronounced feminist accent that gives the film its rationale.The film is breezy and light on its feet. It is never, therefore, in danger of being bogged down by the weighty issues that it addresses. Its simple clarion call is in favour of the rights of women who are robbed of their dreams post-marriage and it is couched in simple methods that do not seek to draw too much attention to themselves.Admittedly, the film isn't saying anything particularly radical but the manner in which it articulates its concerns is informed with commendable thrust. One thing that Laapataa Ladies certainly isn't is heavy-handed. It eschews excess. It says what it has to and moves on.The threat that looms over Phool and Pushpa - part of it emanates from the police inspector hell-bent on cashing in on the distress that Deepak is in as a consequence of the accidental swap - exists only on the edges of the world that the laapataa ladies inhabit.The social satire hits home because it is not only emotionally engaging, it also laced with doses of wry humour. Laapataa Ladies is an 'issue' film that does not fail to be entertaining. Without playing down the gravity of Phool and Pushpa's predicaments, it finds space for hope in the bleakest of situations. That apart, the film throws well-directed punches at patriarchy, the evil of dowry, domestic violence and gender roles thrust upon women in wedlock.The three young leads are wonderfully cast. Nitanshi Goel conveys a combination of fragility and optimism with minimum effort. Sparsh Shrivastav (of Jamtara fame) is solid. Pratibha Ranta is a show-stealer.Among the supporting actors, Ravi Kishan as the cop whose role in the story goes beyond just policing is terrific. Geeta Agrawal Sharma, cast as Deepak's spunky mother, is, as always, pitch-perfect. And what does one say of Chhaya Kadam? She radiates brilliance.Several of the tertiary actors are also noteworthy. Irrespective of how much footage the film apportions to them collectively and individually, they stand out. Satendra Soni, Rachna Gupta playing Deepak's sister-in-law and Durgesh Kumar as a slow-on-the-uptake constable contribute their mite to the film.Laapataa Ladies gets so much right that a blip here or a blemish there can do no damage to the way it shapes up.Cast:Nitanshi Goel, Pratibha Ranta, Sparsh Shrivastava, Ravi Kishan and Chhaya KadamDirector:Kiran Rao","length":6086,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,9,7,7,8,8,9],"reason":"The article provides a detailed and insightful analysis of the film \"Laapataa Ladies,\" praising its emotionally engaging narrative laced with humor.

Jong Shyn floating dock No. 8, where the Narwhal was first docked, opened its valves to allow its chambers to fill with water causing the dry dock to float lower in the water.The floating dock then became submerged and that allowed the sub to be moved into position.When the water was pumped out of the floating dock's chambers, the dry dock rose and the sub was subsequently lifted out of the water on the rising deck.A boat later towed the submarine to CSBC Corp.'s dry dock at around 2:30 p.m.A source told CNA that the Narwhal will begin a series of final tests at the dry dock.Defense scholar and retired Navy captain Jiang Hsin-biao (江炘杓) told CNA that HAT tests at the dry dock are meant to ensure the sub's actual displacement is consistent with its original design.Among the tests conducted will be an inclining test that is performed to determine the ship's stability and the coordinates of its center of gravity.Other tests during the final HAT process at the dry dock will focus on all of the ship's equipment, ventilation system and engine system separately, before running a comprehensive test by connecting the systems together, Jiang said.Only after successful completion of the HAT tests will the prototype move on to sea acceptance tests, according to Taiwan's military and CSBC.","length":1979,"publishedTime":"2024-02-27T19:35:00+08:00","rating":[8,8,7,7,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides a detailed and factual account of Taiwan's submarine prototype being towed to a dry dock for final harbor acceptance tests.

The representation of women in those top-tier gigs, Yeo says, \"is very poor.\"As a composer who cut her teeth at the Australian Film Television and Radio School, Yeo has been writing music for the screen for more than 20 years.She says a lot has changed since the 2000s. Back then:\"No women were getting awards, no women were getting recognised and certainly the women were not getting any of the big [blockbuster] gigs.\"In 2016, Yeo co-founded the Gender Equity Committee at the Australian Guild of Screen Composers. \"[Now] there is definitely a larger representation and awareness of female screen composers in the industry,\" Yeo says.Recognition of music by female composersAs a younger composer, Alice Chance is aware of how much she has benefited from the increasingly inclusive environment of the classical composition world in the 2010s.Chance received early career support for female composers while she was studying and noticed the gradual change in the music people hear and perform in concerts.\"It used to be an anomaly if there was a female composer on a concert program,\" Chance reflects. \"Now it's becoming more of an anomaly if there isn't.\" Caitlin Yeo has seen and overseen changes to the recognition of women in the film industry. While progress has been made during her career, she cautions against getting complacent about gender equity.(Supplied: Caitlin Yeo)Yeo warns us not to be complacent, pointing out this is not the first time gender equity initiatives have been implemented.In the film industry, she cites an initiative from the 1980s that was discontinued when everyone thought the numbers were going in the right direction, resulting in the industry becoming more male-dominated again in the 1990s and 2000s.\"Unless you put the pressure on consistently and continually, it does fall back to the status quo,\" Yeo cautions.The future will take care of itself if we look after the presentCheetham Fraillon points out the battle for recognition of music by diverse composers is ongoing, and it's happening as we speak. \"If we win that battle, then the presence of female composers in Australian classical music will be assured,\" she says.At present, this lack of diversity is impacting the audience.\"When [the] audience only hears music from a narrow section of mostly German composers who lived in the 19th century, it's like only hearing part of the story or seeing part of the picture.\" \"This way of doing business is exclusionary and it is not sustainable,\" Cheetham Fraillon states, referencing statistics tracking music performed by Australia's major performing arts organisations. The report found that in 2019-2020, music by Bach, Beethoven, Brahms and Mozart were performed more times than the combined works by women composers, and more recent data isn't showing significant progress.Building diversity in the music worldBeing a culturally and linguistically diverse composer, Yeo reflects on the complex challenges of drawing from her Asian heritage while ensuring she isn't siloed by expectations.\"What I would like to see is an equal representation and an unfettered opportunity for all composers, no matter their background or gender, where they can all write music for the bigger gigs,\" Yeo says.Writing the score for Danger Close in 2019, a film about Australian's involvement in the Vietnam war, was significant for Yeo. \"That was a big film for Australia at the time and [director] Kriv Stenders put a female composer in that seat,\" she reflects, and \"he got a very different score for that film.\"As a lesbian and feminist, it's important for Cheetham Fraillon to invest in a world which isn't dominated by one group. \"The future needs to be a reflection of society,\" she says, \"as inclusive and diverse as the society we have in Australia.\"Chance is aware of her privilege growing up in an environment where she experienced \"practically zero discrimination.\" Alice Chance benefited from early career support for female composers in Australia. (Alice Chance: Soumya Subramanian)She says it armed her to navigate a much more challenging musical landscape when she moved to France in 2021.In building a more inclusive music world, Chance advocates for intersectional factors to be taken into account.\"I would love to see us continue to prioritise making our classical and new music spaces welcoming and inclusive.\"Chance says, \"this will attract diverse artists who feel safe (whether that means culturally, physically, accessibility-wise or otherwise) to do their best work.\"","length":6070,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T22:00:00+00:00","rating":[8,8,9,7,9,8,8],"reason":"The article provides a comprehensive overview of female composers in the classical and screen music worlds, highlighting their contributions, challenges, and the ongoing battle for diversity and gender equity.

The following year, her still-beloved ex-boyfriend, the rapper Mac Miller, died of an accidental overdose. She then got together with comedian Pete Davidson but swiftly broke off their engagement in her enduring grief. Her music evolved from enjoyable post-Nickelodeon bad-girl R&B to process these anguishes with fleet sophistication, and Grande’s name came to populate the writing credits: 2018’s at-ease Sweetener was her statement of survival. Five months later came Thank U, Next, a breezier assertion of acceptance and pleasure that was written and recorded in just a few weeks, after Grande said she wanted to be freed from pop’s heavy logistics to release music like a rapper – to “talk to my fans and sing and write music and drop it the way these boys do”. One year on, Positions precariously navigated the compatibility of healing and moving on. The latter was a minor dip in quality, but the intimacy and immediacy of Grande’s reborn project felt transcendent.The artwork for Eternal Sunshine. Photograph: Publicity imageHer tentative recovery continued when she got married in 2021. Two years later, it was over – and unfounded speculation about Grande’s alleged infidelity, as well as taking up with her married (but separated) co-star in a forthcoming film adaptation of the musical Wicked, prompted a backlash, despite “a source” telling People that there was no overlap with either party’s prior relationship. Social media gossips made viral clips compiling “evidence” of Grande’s alleged history of cheating. At the end of 2023, the press-shy musician posted a rare statement on Instagram about feeling “so deeply misunderstood by people who don’t know me, who piece whispers together and make what they want out of me and their assumptions of my life”. In January, her Vogue-referencing comeback single Yes, And? reminded haters “your business is yours and mine is mine / Why do you care so much whose dick I ride?”, which unfortunately also highlighted the drama to anyone blissfully aware of it. Apparently many did care: she lost 360,000 Instagram followers after the song’s announcement. It’s a dispiriting reminder of the fickleness of public favour and the entitlement over other people’s business that social media has stirred – the souring of Grande’s unusual vulnerability.Fortunately, the outcry hasn’t stymied her candour on her opulent, bumping seventh album, which moves from self-scouring to implications of her ex’s treachery – suggesting she may previously have been keeping her powder dry for Eternal Sunshine. There’s delicious provocation: “I’ll play whatever part you need me to,” she sings to whoever’s smearing her on True Story, “and I’ll be good in it too”; “You got me misunderstood but at least I look this good,” on We Can’t Be Friends (Wait for Your Love). With its lurching bass and flinching vocals, the former evokes Jai Paul remixing Justin Timberlake’s betrayal ur-text Cry Me a River, while the latter shares the juddering synths and chiptune flourishes of Robyn’s homewrecking anthem Call Your Girlfriend – though the effect is jarringly retro.Ariana Grande: Yes, And? – videoWith these knowing references, Grande toys with perceptions of victimhood and villainy that she knows she can’t control. But beyond these barbs, she’s more interested in the unpredictability of connection – the album opens with her asking “how can I tell if I’m in the right relationship?” – a sometimes painful, sometimes ecstatic fact of adult life that she handles with realism and compassion comparable to Adele’s divorce album, 30. The title track alludes to Michel Gondry’s 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and the impossibility of easily forgetting; sparkling like a miniature ballerina in a pink velvet box, I Wish I Hated You is a futile yearning for absolutes. Grande understands that living means salvaging what you can from the wreckage and moving on, and the risk-aversion and second-guessing of Positions makes way for action and instinct here, even when it’s destructive: with trap-Aaliyah hauteur, the possessive The Boy Is Mine “takes full accountability for all these tears” she has caused yet concludes “but I can’t ignore my heart” (underscored, in the official lyrics, by six exclamation marks). Her lyrics are piercingly direct, making the tedious astrology explainer Saturn Returns Interlude, a pro-forma irritant about growth, even more redundant.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionUnlike some peers, Grande has never been one for whole-cloth reinvention, and her post-2020 run reflects an artist dedicated to refining the links between Hollywood grandeur, classic R&B and trap’s staccato fizz. Primarily helmed by Grande and core collaborators Max Martin and Ilya Salmanzadeh (her staple co-writer Victoria Monét, now a solo artist in her own right, isn’t here), Eternal Sunshine is more full-bodied than the silvery, breathy Positions, though the album starts with a bit of a feint in Bye, a lavish orchestral-disco showstopper that soundtracks our heroine’s freedom. Otherwise Grande’s vibe is nocturnal-casual, and almost disarmingly so – riffling through devastating sentiments about lies, or being too much for someone who, on Don’t Wanna Break Up Again, turns up the TV to drown out her tears, with such breezy vocal virtuosity that the trauma flutters by.Maybe that’s where it’s best left: at any rate, it doesn’t infect the optimism of the two closing songs, which celebrate the imperfection and ease of new love. We know that Grande has been here before, and from the off-kilter, minor-key vocal motifs and strange, slack guitar of Imperfect for You, you sense she knows the folly of her hope. Love is fallible. Contrary to what some fans might think, the heart does not always deal in moral rectitude. Putting Grande on a pedestal helps no one, and the beatific, mature Eternal Sunshine brings her safely back down to earth.This week Laura listened toSui Zhen – SleeplessWritten after the Melbourne musician endured not just the death of her mother but that of her newborn son, Sleepless is a stunningly lucid 13-minute epic about grief that brings to mind Jenny Hval and Let’s Eat Grandma in a surge of swooping, ecstatic electronics that build until they sound ready to take off.","length":6566,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T05:00:42.000Z","rating":[8,7,9,8,9,8,9],"reason":"The article provides accurate information regarding Ariana Grande's personal life, her music evolution, and the themes explored in her latest album.

(WFXR) –It’s been four months since one of the largest wildfires recorded in Virginia. The Matts Creek wildfire burned for weeks in southwest Virginia affecting thousands of acres of land in Bedford County. Crews quickly started restoration efforts, even hand-spreading seed on some of the burned areas to bring it back to life. \nWhile the cause of the fire is still unknown, the U.S. Department of Agriculture said the restoration efforts were minimal, and things are already greening up for spring.\nHowever, as spring arrives it brings with it the bloom of flowers and the return of green leafy trees, But it also brings the chance for more wildfires. Spring fire season, Feb. 15 to April 30, has begun — Virginia banning open burning until 4 p.m. statewide.\n“We have these warmer temperatures, we have a lot of dormant vegetation some of which has been killed by frost, and we also have a lot of dead leaves on the ground from last fall,” said Cory Swift, the Communications Specialist with the Virginia Department of Forestry.\nSwift says the area burned in the Matt Creeks fire probably won’t see more fires this season because the elements that fueled the flames last year were mostly burned away. However, he says people should still be cautious this spring.\n“Virginia has on average 700 wildfires every year and we tend to see 60 percent of that in the spring,” Swift said. “We’ve actually responded to 82 wildfires already this year that have burned about 16 hundred acres.”\nHe said Southwest Virginia has more fires on average than any other area in Virginia, but he is not the only one pressing safety. Local fire officials chimed in as well.\n“We’ve been fortunate enough to have a lot of rain here in the last month or so. So we’re not overly concerned with spring fire season, but it would only take a few good days of wind and dry conditions and the top cover can get really dry and we’ll get a lot of fires running,” said Fire Chief Todd Stone with the Bedford Fire Department.\nChief Stone says his department often sees people underestimate winds this time of year.\n“Anytime you want to burn brush or anything, you want to stay 100 feet away from the woods. You want to make sure that you have a water source and stay with that fire,” explained Chief Stone. \nHe says you should always have your phone on hand for emergencies. He wanted to remind people that open burning is only for brush, leaves, and yard debris. Things like trash and construction debris should be discarded.\nHe also wanted to remind residents that the Town of Bedford requires people to ask for permission before burning and that Bedford County asks anyone burning anything large to give their local law enforcement a heads-up via a non-emergency line.","length":2809,"publishedTime":"2024-03-08T04:25:59+00:00","rating":[7,7,8,6,8,7,6],"reason":"The article provides factual information about the recent Matts Creek wildfire in Bedford County, Virginia, and the potential risks during the spring fire season.

He has pleaded not guilty.\n The indictment against Trump in Florida, prosecutors said, “does not charge Trump for any acts that he undertook as President, let alone an official presidential act.”\n Smith’s office asked Judge Aileen Cannon to certify Trump’s new immunity claim as “frivolous,” which would foreclose the former president’s avenue for an immediate appeal that would delay the trial. An immunity claim is one of the few issues that, if appealed, could derail a trial.\n The timelines leading to trial have become a flashpoint in Smith’s two prosecutions.\n Trump’s presidential immunity claim in his separate January 6, 2021-related federal case, which is largely about actions he took while president, wasn’t deemed to be frivolous by the courts, and his case has been on hold for weeks while the courts consider the issue. The Supreme Court has scheduled oral arguments for April 25.\n In separate court filings Thursday, Smith responded to Trump’s other arguments for dismissing the classified documents case, including allegations of selective and vindictive prosecution as well as claims that the former president was allowed to take classified material to his Mar-a-Lago estate after he left the White House and that the special counsel was unlawfully appointed.\n Cannon set a hearing for March 14, and told the parties to “reserve a full day for argument” on two motions from the defendants covering their argument that Trump was legally allowed to take classified material to his Mar-a-Lago residence.\n Smith pushed back strongly on Trump’s claim that he’s the victim of selective and vindictive prosecution, and being treated differently than others who have allegedly mishandled classified material – including President Joe Biden and former Vice President Mike Pence.\n “He has not identified anyone who has engaged in a remotely similar battery of criminal conduct and not been prosecuted as a result,” prosecutors wrote in their filing.\n Smith leaned heavily on former special counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s handling of classified documents, saying the Trump’s comparison between the two probes “fails.” Hur declined last month to bring charges against Biden in the matter.\n “Trump, unlike Biden, is alleged to have engaged in extensive and repeated efforts to obstruct justice and thwart the return of documents bearing classification markings,” the special counsel wrote.\n Smith said that the former president’s arguments do not satisfy the legal elements required to prevail on such a claim, which include showing that prosecutors acted with “genuine animus” toward a defendant.\n Instead, prosecutors said, the conduct at issue in the case made it so that “Trump ‘in effect selected [himself] for prosecution.’”\n Trump has also repeatedly asserted both on the campaign trail and in court that his handling of classified material is allowed under the Presidential Records Act, but prosecutors say nothing in the federal law permitted Trump to take and store classified material.\n “His claim that obviously presidential records — highly sensitive government documents bearing classification markings that were presented to Trump during his term in office — can be transformed into ‘personal’ records by the alchemy of removing them from the White House is false,” prosecutors wrote.\n And while Trump’s attorneys have argued that as president, he could designate records as “personal” and lawfully keep them after leaving office, prosecutors said Thursday that, “Nothing in the PRA remotely suggests that the President can lawfully convert presidential records into personal ones simply by removing them from the White House at the end of his term.”\n The PRA says the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from their administration. Personal records are described in the PRA as things like personal notes, materials relating to private political associations or materials relating exclusively to the president’s own election to the White House.","length":5366,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T23:04:36.273Z","rating":[7,8,6,7,8,6,7],"reason":"The article is rated highly in accuracy as it provides detailed factual information about the legal battle between Trump and the special counsel.

I will work towards winning your hearts further.”Modi and his party have accused Kashmir’s pro-India parties of being corrupt, misleading Kashmiris and promoting separatism in the region. Kashmiri politicians, who say their special status was a constitutional guarantee, have called Modi divisive and anti-minority.\n Paramilitary soldiers patrol ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Srinagar, Indian controlled Kashmir, Wednesday, March 6, 2024. (AP Photo/Mukhtar Khan)\nThousands of armed paramilitary troops and police in flak jackets maintained extra vigilance across the Kashmir Valley, the heartland of the ongoing rebellion against Indian rule in the majority-Muslim territory, where many residents strongly favor independence or a merger with Pakistan. Modi’s two previous visits to Kashmir after its status was changed were to the Hindu-dominated city of Jammu.Modi did not mention plans to hold elections in the region or to restore its statehood, both demanded by Kashmir’s pro-India political parties. The last election for the regional legislature were held in 2014, but the government elected then was dismissed in 2018.\nIn 2019, Modi’s Hindu-nationalist-led government revoked the region’s semi-autonomous status, annulled its separate constitution, split the area into two federal territories — Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir — and removed inherited protections on land and jobs. The Muslim-majority region is now run by unelected government officials and bureaucrats.\nIndia’s powerful home minister, Amit Shah, has repeatedly promised that the region would regain statehood after elections.In December, India’s Supreme Court upheld the 2019 decision and asked the government to conduct polls by September.The region has been on edge since 2019, as authorities put in place a slew of new laws that many residents fear could change Kashmir’s demographics. The move was welcomed in much of India, where the Modi government was cheered by supporters for fulfilling a long-held Hindu nationalist pledge.In New Delhi’s effort to shape what it calls a “new Kashmir,” India has shown no tolerance for dissent, curbing civil liberties and intimidating media.Ahead of Modi’s visit to Srinagar, government forces laid razor wires and erected checkpoints on roads leading to the venue. They randomly frisked residents and searched vehicles, while navy commandos in motorboats patrolled the Jhelum River that snakes through the city.Authorities ordered thousands of government employees, including teachers, to attend the meeting, and most schools in the city were closed for the day.\nThursday’s event is seen as part of Modi’s campaign ahead of national elections scheduled in April and May.Such security measures have been common in Kashmir since 1989, when rebels began fighting against Indian rule. Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, and both claim the Himalayan region in its entirety. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism.

[Photo/Xinhua] \nAs has become the norm in recent years, as soon as it was announced, China's proposed defense budget triggered a furor from some Western media, alleging a lack of transparency. \nThe Associated Press, for example, has claimed that China's actions are fueling a regional arms race and its military spending is \"furthering growth in high-tech military technologies, from stealth fighters to aircraft carriers and a growing arsenal of nuclear weapons\", and that the official spending figure \"is considered only a fraction\" of the country's spending \"once spending on research and development and foreign weapons purchases are considered\". \nSince those are the weapons platforms for modern warfare and deterrence, it is natural that those should be the priorities; muskets and swords are not what a modern military requires. As for the latter claim, the warning about the US military-industrial complex was issued way back in the 1950s, and that nexus is now so deeply embedded in the United States that the country needs to be perpetually at war. \nSuch deliberate distortions of China's military modernization are of course intended to reinforce the narrative of an aggressive China. \nFacts speak louder than words. Compared with the US military spending, China's military expenditure and its pace of increase are no match either in size, in increase rate or in terms of per capita or per service-person. \nThe US, the world's top military spender, has maintained military spending that is three to four times the size of China's. It recently approved an increase of about 5 percent in its defense budget for 2024, which has reached a staggering $886 billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the total amount of global defense spending. The new budget, hitting a record high again, far exceeds China's. \nThe Chinese government's proposed defense budget for 2024 is 1.67 trillion yuan, equivalent to about $232 billion, a 7.2 percent year-on-year increase, the same rate as last year and the ninth consecutive year of single-digit growth. Such comparatively low military spending belies the malign intent behind the allegations that Beijing is increasingly \"assertive\" or even \"aggressive\". \nIt does not require any great detective skills to identify who is guilty of such behavior. From Afghanistan to Iraq, from the Ukraine conflict to the Israeli military operations in Gaza, the world's top military spender has waged and engineered wars and resorted to military interventions at will. Warmongering Washington has set the stage for an arms race and is trying to lure others to participate in it. \nJapan has approved a hefty 16 percent increase in its military spending for 2024, making it the world's third-largest military spender, behind only the US and China. To cover its real intention to break away from the country's self-defense-only principle, the Japanese government claims that its latest defense budget hike is primarily in response to the growing military threats from countries such as China and Russia. \nLast month, Australia unveiled plans to build its largest navy since World War II, allocating more than $35 billion for the defense project over the next 10 years. \nWith the US viewing China as a strategic rival and forming small cliques to contain and bully it, China is facing a worsening security environment and growing security risks as the US and its allies constantly stoke tensions over the South China Sea and the Taiwan question. \nIt is only justified that China should allocate funds to ensure it has the means to effectively safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity, better respond to various challenges and be better prepared for potential risks and threats on its doorsteps. \nBut at the same time, the country will continue to contribute to international peacekeeping efforts and remain committed to safeguarding world peace and stability.","length":4129,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[8,7,8,6,9,7,8],"reason":"The article provides a detailed analysis of China's defense budget and contrasts it with the United States and other countries.

The Tele Had a Really Wiry Sound Compared to My Les Paul Custom... I Immediately Began to Approach Music Differently\"","byline":"Andy Ellis","excerpt":"He's played with Eric Clapton, the Everly Brothers, Emmylou Harris, the Crickets, Joe Cocker, and countless others, but – as he told GP in this 2010 interview – Albert Lee is always, still, looking for \"that perfect night onstage.\"","textContent":"This interview originally appeared in the August 2010 issue of Guitar Player.When Albert Lee takes the stage with his buddy and former bandleader Eric Clapton at the 2010 Crossroads Guitar Festival, he’ll be celebrating his 50th year as a professional guitarist. Like the warp-speed solos he spins so effortlessly, Lee’s musical odyssey has an unusually long arc. In addition to being a founding member of the pioneering late-’60s country-rock band, Head Hands & Feet, Lee backed Clapton for five years in the late ’70s, and has toured and recorded with the Everly Brothers, Emmylou Harris, the Crickets, and Joe Cocker. He’s also a veteran of countless sessions in London, Nashville, and Los Angeles.As a young man in his native England, Lee was inspired by Jimmy Bryant, Cliff Gallup, Scotty Moore, and James Burton to forge his own white-knuckle picking style from elements of hot-rod country and jump-jivin’ rockabilly. Voted “Best Country Guitarist“ five times in the GP Readers’ Choice Awards, Lee continues to thrill festival crowds in the U.K. and across Europe with his band, Hogan’s Heroes, and also plays in Bill Wyman’s Rhythm Kings.Lee’s peers are among his most ardent fans. In the introduction to Country Boy: A Biography of Albert Lee, by Derek Watts, Clapton writes, “He is a great, great player, fluid, lyrical, and free – like a jazz musician, but with country scales; like Django, but with a bluegrass past.“ Emmylou Harris once said, “When St. Peter asks me to chronicle my time down here on Earth, I’ll be able to say, with pride if that’s allowed, that for a while, I played rhythm guitar in a band with Albert Lee.“Few guitarists can boast a half-century of musical activity, much less burn as Lee does in Live at Stazione Birra: Rome, a concert DVD he taped with Hogan’s Heroes. At 66, Lee’s hair is now white, but he still plays with the adrenalin-fueled passion of a teenager.You witnessed the birth of rock and roll in England. What was it like to be a guitarist then?“Well, it was a challenge to find a decent instrument. We were still struggling after World War II. I started playing around 1957, and back then there was an embargo on imported luxury goods in Britain. It wasn’t until 1960 that Fenders and Gibsons started to come into England in fair numbers.“I borrowed guitars from school friends for a while, and eventually got a Hofner archtop. In 1959, I traded it for a solidbody with three pickups and a tremolo. It looked like what Buddy Holly was playing, so I thought, 'Yeah, that’s the real thing.' But it wasn’t – it was made in Czechoslovakia. Back then we didn’t know what a Fender was.“How did you make the leap to professional gear?“In about ’61, a big shop called Selmer’s on Charing Cross Road, in the West End of London, began carrying Gibsons from the Super 400 on down. I really wanted a Gibson at that point, because Scotty Moore was such a big influence. I’d study these guitars, trying to figure out which one I could afford. I wound up buying a Les Paul Custom.“Were you playing rockabilly by then?“Yes, though I didn’t have an unwound third string until around ’61, after Eddie Cochran came over to England and spread the word about what guys were doing in the States with an unwound third. “Sets with plain thirds weren’t available at that time in England, so I’d buy a set of Gibson Sonomatics plus an extra first string. I’d throw away the sixth string, move the remaining five down, and make up the difference with the extra first string. The first rock-and-roll sets to come into England were Fender 150s, gauged .010-.038. I used those for a long time.“(Image credit: Fin Costello/Redferns/Getty Images)When did you embrace the Telecaster?“Back in ’63, I bought a second-hand Tele and it changed my life completely. The Tele had a really wiry sound compared to my Les Paul Custom, so I immediately began to approach music differently.“In what way?“At the time, I was into Scotty Moore, with his country and rock-and-roll mix, and Cliff Gallup, who was more of a swing player. I’d heard James Burton, but what he was doing with all those bends was a little alien to me until I got a Tele of my own. When I realized I could get that James Burton, string-bending sound with a Tele, I thought, 'Wow, this is really cool.'“When I was in Eric's band, I thought, 'This guy is really milking the music for all it’s worth. What he’s doing is relatively simple, but it fits amazingly well.' Now I try to think that way when I playYou’re known for your superb flatpick-plus-fingers technique. Did you always play that way, or did you develop this hybrid approach later?“I’ve always picked that way because I was trying to copy what I’d heard Scotty Moore play with Elvis. By the early ’60s there were a couple of guys in London using a thumbpick like Chet Atkins, so I tried a thumbpick for about five minutes. I realized it wasn’t for me, because the real fast picking I was working on came a lot easier with a flatpick. Those thumbpickers sounded really good, but they couldn’t play what I was doing, so I just persevered with the approach I already had.“From your Live at Stazione Birra: Rome DVD, it’s evident you’ve mastered the art of playing flowing lines that span an entire cycle of a song’s progression. This is very different from B.B. King or Eric Clapton, who play short phrases and then pause to hold a note.“And I don’t know if that’s a blessing or a curse. I have a pretty fluid technique, and it can run away with me. If I do fall over or make a mistake, I’m able to take it somewhere else. It’s like going on a cross-country run: I’m able to negotiate most things that come my way, but I often think I should sit back and survey the landscape, and pick and choose more. “I started to learn that playing with Eric. When I was in his band, I thought, 'This guy is really milking the music for all it’s worth. What he’s doing is relatively simple, but it fits amazingly well.' Now I try to think that way when I play.“My knowledge of the fretboard came through working out Cliff Gallup solos. He was great with a tremolo bar too, so I started out using the tremolo on my first couple of guitars, but then got away from it for many years. I rediscovered it when Music Man started offering tremolos on my signature model guitars.“Give us an overview of the Albert Lee model’s evolution.“Originally, Music Man built it as a prototype in the mid ’80s. They had this wild body shape that looked so cool. I played the prototype to death – I just loved it. Eventually, [Music Man’s] Sterling Ball said, 'We’re going to put your guitar out.' “The one I’d been playing had three single-coil, Alnico II pickups Seymour Duncan designed for me. The bridge pickup had a metal plate underneath it, somewhat like a Tele rear pickup, so it has a bit more bite than a Strat pickup in that position. We explored a Tele-style pickup suspended from a metal bridge plate – I still have one of those prototypes – but eventually settled on the three-pickup, Strat-like configuration, because I liked the way that guitar sounded so much.“The model first came out with a pinkburst finish and fixed tailpiece. I think it originally had a six-bolt neck plate. That changed to a five-bolt plate, which eventually became recessed – a nice touch – and then the neck heel was rounded off to make playing up high more comfortable.“Has your signature guitar always sported those custom Seymour Duncans?“Oh yeah, we haven’t changed them, although the guitar is now also available with three soapbar pickups, and recently they’ve added a dual-humbucker version to the line.“(Image credit: Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images)How did the tremolo model come about?“Sterling told me Music Man wanted to build a tremolo-equipped model and asked how I felt about it. I told him that was fine, although I wasn’t using a tremolo unit. But when I eventually tried one and discovered how well the unit handled, I became a convert. Now I much prefer it to the fixed bridge model.“The tremolo comes with three springs, which I adjust slightly from the factory setting. I like true vibrato – the ability to lower and raise the pitch – so I set the tremolo unit to float by slackening the springs just a bit. I also put the tremolo bar in a vise and bend it so it sits more flush to the body. I like the bar to be within reach of my pinky while I’m picking.“On your concert DVD, the trem comes back into tune really well, even after you’ve wrenched it.“Oh, it’s just amazing. I drop that bottom E down to an A – sometimes even E an octave below – and it just comes right back. The bridge sits on two pointed pivots. It’s a wonderful design.“And this guitar comes with locking tuners too?“Yes, and they’re great. If you’d asked me before I’d tried them, I would have said I prefer traditional tuners, because the locking ones add some weight. But the locking tuners keep the whole guitar in tune, despite all the dive bombs I do. And it’s not just one guitar, each one I play works just as well.“Tell us about your amp, strings, and picks.“I’ve been using a 100-watt Fender Tone Master head and 4x12 cabinet for at least six or seven years. For strings, I like Ernie Ball’s Regular Slinky set, 010 to .046 gauges, but with a custom third string. “For quite a few years I used a .016 instead of the stock .017, but these days I’ve been using a .015 and I don’t notice a significant difference in tone. Music Man still sends me guitars with a .016 third. Maybe I should tell them what I’m doing [laughs]. I use Ernie Ball picks – heavy for electric, medium for acoustic.“You’re known for using delay to create cascading runs, as in “Country Boy” on your 1979 solo album, Hiding, and “Sister’s Coming Home” and “Luxury Liner,” which you recorded with Emmylou Harris. How did you discover this technique?“When I met Jerry Reed in ’68 or ’69, he told me you could get great delay tricks with an Echoplex, but didn’t explain how. It wasn’t until I picked up an instrumental album by Jim and Jesse, a bluegrass duo featuring Jesse McReynolds on mandolin, that I heard someone using echo to add notes to a line. It sounded amazing, so in ’71 or ’72, I brought an Echoplex back to England, but it took me two or three years to stumble upon how you create that effect. “I was actually playing too many notes. You have to play a very strict four notes to the bar and slide the playhead until the repeat comes in a beat-and-a-half later. This way the delay falls between each note you’re picking. To make it work, you have to set the delay for only one repeat and keep the echo at the same volume and tone as the original note.“Sometimes I’ll play these horrible little bars for $50 or whatever, and the reason is I’m hoping it would be that extra special gig I always search for. I keep looking for that perfect night onstageWhat do you currently use for delay?“Eventually I switched from the Echoplex to a Lexicon PCM 42, but these days I use a Korg A3 – it’s my favorite effects unit. In fact, I’ve got five of them. It’s a little tricky to get timed echo on the fly with an A3 because you have to program the delay time. It’s a lot easier with a pedal or a unit that has a variable delay knob on it.“Looking back over five decades of music making, what highlights stand out?“Playing with the Crickets is one; another highlight is when I first came to the States with Head Hands & Feet. I went out with Joe Cocker for a while, and that was fun. Playing with Emmylou Harris and taking over from my hero, James Burton, was a huge turning point. Emmylou introduced me to a whole new American audience.(from left) Emory Gordy, Emmylou Harris, John Ware and Albert Lee perform at the Berkeley Community Theater in Berkeley, California on April 26, 1977 (Image credit: Ed Perlstein/Redferns/Getty Images)“Obviously, I had a great time playing with Clapton for five years, and I also loved the 20 years I performed with the Everly Brothers. It was absolutely amazing to be involved with the Concert for George at the Royal Albert Hall in London. And, of course, playing the Crossroads Festival. That’s a pretty big show to be involved with, and I’m happy to be doing it again this year.“Few musicians manage to sustain a career for half a century. What’s your secret?“I see some guitarists who had a lot of success during a certain period, yet now they sit back on their laurels. Every six months they might rehearse a band for a tour, but they’re not playing all the time and it shows. I like to think I’m playing as well as I ever did, and the reason for that is I haven’t really stopped. “Sometimes I’ll play these horrible little bars for $50 or whatever, and the reason is I’m hoping it would be that extra special gig I always search for.

That said, religion is still a theme in the game - something seemingly evident by its focus on the Butlerian jihad: the war between humans and AI.\nStill, the suggestion of a \"sidestep\" prompted surprise from fans - prompting Funcom to respond.\n\"We agree that religion is an integral part of the Dune universe,\" reads a statement from Funcom, posted to social media platform X. \"This is why in Dune: Awakening you will meet and interact with people of different religions along your journey. \n\"However, as opposed to the story presented in the books, the player is not a messiah and will not play a major role in any of them. Leading people on a holy war is not why you arrive on Arrakis.\"\nEurogamer previously asked if Dune main character Paul Atreides would pop up in the game at all, to which Bylos replied: \"No comment\".\nIn a follow-up statement to Eurogamer, Bylos detailed the game's relationship with religion further - and the misconception that religion would not exist in Dune: Awakening at all.\n\"Religion is at the core of the book because the main character is hailed as messiah and the potential Kwisatz Haderach. As Paul interacts with the Fremen, he takes on the mantle of the Lisan-al-Gaib and leads them on their holy war.\n\"When I say we 'sidestep' religion, I am not saying religion doesn't exist in the game (which is how people seem to have reacted) but that the player is not a central or important figure in any religion.

The trio will hear in June what compensation they may be entitled to.\nDr Harvie and Professor Lilley – who both had worked for the university for nearly two decades – submitted that while the law allowed the university to disinvest from research in their field of study and make redundancies owing to this decision, the selection process had been conducted in a “sloppy manner without a codified selection criteria or marking scheme and with unreliable information”.\nProfessor Lilley, now professor of organisational studies and management at the University of Lincoln, told Times Higher Education that the university had failed to implement “the simplest basics of redundancy law”.\n“These are experienced organisations with large budgets and professional HR functions,” he said. “The bar for making somebody legally redundant in the UK is so low that if you can’t get over that, you really are not fit for the task you are employed to do.”\nThe hearing heard that, following a decision by the business school’s managers, the dean and the deputy dean of the school at the time, Jim Devlin and Dan Ladley, conducted a screening exercise to identify staff whose research aligned with the fields at risk but omitted the whole of the department of economics, finance and accounting.\nThose whose research was identified as being primarily focused on critical management studies and political economy were placed in a pool for redundancy and were told that all would lose their jobs unless they could demonstrate that their research aligned with the school’s future direction. Eventually, nine academics were made redundant out of 16 initially placed in this pool.\nProfessor Ladley told the tribunal that placing all staff at risk of redundancy would have “caused unnecessary stress for staff” when there was already “sufficient knowledge of their research activity”.\nThe judge ruled that the screening exercise had been “in fact a selection process and that a reasonable employer would have viewed it as such and have consulted in advance of its use” and that concerns about stress were “not an acceptable reason” to conduct the process in this way.\nLeicester’s case was further damaged by a lack of documentation – including no emails or notes of any meetings between the senior leaders – which led to the judge’s concluding that “it was not clear how that initial selection had been carried out”.\n“This did not help in considering whether a fair process had been adopted and that the decision to dismiss was within the range of reasonable response,” the ruling says.\nProfessor Lilley – who, with colleagues, will publish a book about their experiences this summer – said academics were getting “cannier” about winning such cases and it showed the importance of challenging such processes.\nA Leicester spokesperson said: “While we respect the findings of the tribunal, we are disappointed that an unfair dismissal claim was upheld.

Image Credit: Image Point Fr/Shutterstock.com\nAOM is the second most common illness in children in the United States (US). Despite the high prevalence, the diagnostic accuracy of AOM has been consistently ≤ 75%.\nMethods to improve accuracy and facilitate diagnosis have evolved over the years. Recent efforts to improve diagnostic accuracy have focused on artificial intelligence (AI).\nSeveral studies have leveraged deep learning for training neural networks to detect AOM and other ear-related conditions, albeit with limited clinical application.\nIn the present study, researchers developed and validated an AI decision support tool for interpreting tympanic membrane (TM) videos and improving AOM diagnosis.\nFirst, a medical-grade mobile application or app was designed to capture TM videos; users could adjust brightness and focus to capture the best image. The app was also embedded with voice recognition software to enable controls through voice commands.\nAs an optional feature, users could record their impressions (of TM) and presumptive diagnosis. Next, a training library was developed using otoscopic assessments of children presenting for wellness or sickness visits. Convenience sampling was applied to select children.\nAn endoscope or otoscope connected to the smartphone was used to capture videos of children’s TMs. Two otoscopists reviewed the videos and assigned a diagnosis.\nThe team administered a survey of parents of children whose examination included the use of the AI classifier.\nRelated StoriesNew comprehensive report on pediatric long COVID symptoms publishedMaternal antibiotic use during childbirth tied to higher risk of autoimmune diseases in childrenLong COVID in children: A closer look reveals lasting impactsA deep residual (DR)-recurrent neural network (RNN) was trained using TM videos as input and expert-assigned diagnosis as the reference. Model output was TM features and AOM diagnosis. Around 80% of videos were used for training and 20% for testing.\nThe DR-RNN model generated the probability of AOM for each video, and AOM was diagnosed if the probability was ≥ 50%. The Youden index, viz., the difference between true and false positive rates, was estimated at different probability thresholds to validate the choice of the threshold.\nAdditionally, a decision tree (DT) model was developed as an alternative to examine if the results would be different; this used DR-RNN model-predicted TM features.\nThe team compared different frame extraction methods: diversity maximization, blurriness minimization, sharpness maximization, equal width sampling, and contrast maximization.\nIn addition, an image quality classifier was trained and tested to prompt users that the videos captured may be sub-optimal for diagnostic purposes.\nThe researchers compared the output generated by both models with expert-assigned diagnosis and computed sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values.\nA receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated for the DR-RNN model by plotting true and false positive results at different probability thresholds. ROC was not plotted for the DT model as it was not probabilistic.\nOverall, 1,151 videos were selected from 635 children, predominantly younger than three years. Experts assigned 305 videos as AOM and the remainder as not AOM.\nSixty parent questionnaires were obtained; results were favorable, with 80% of parents urging the reuse of the classifier in future visits.\nThe accuracy of DT and DR-RNN models was almost identical. The sensitivity and specificity of the DR-RNN model were 93.8% and 93.5%, respectively.\nThe corresponding figures for the DT model were 93.7% and 93.3% respectively. For the DR-RNN model, the area under the ROC was 0.973.\nDiversity maximization yielded the most accurate results for frame selection. Clips shorter than two seconds were difficult to classify compared to longer clips. The exclusion of low-resolution clips did not improve model output. The average prediction time was 4.6 seconds.\nThe maximum Youden value was 0.88 at the 42% threshold, almost equivalent to that (0.876) at 50%. Among model-generated TM features, TM bulging was closely aligned with the predicted diagnosis.\nBulging was detected in all 230 cases predicted to be AOM. The sensitivity and specificity of the image quality filter were 92.3% and 78.3%, respectively.\nIn sum, the researchers generated an AI algorithm to classify videos of TM into AOM or no AOM categories. The classifier was more accurate than primary care physicians, pediatricians, and advanced practice clinicians.\nAs such, it could be used to aid in treatment-related decisions. Overall, the findings suggest that this AI decision support tool could improve AOM diagnostic accuracy in children.\nMoreover, TM videos could be used for enhanced otoscopic examination, discussions with colleagues or parents, and documentation in health records.Journal reference:\n\tShaikh N, Conway SJ, Kovačević J, et al.

And second, Kyle Harrison was so dominant in those three innings that Chapman hardly even got to break a sweat.Harrison struck out six of the 12 batters he faced before a steady drizzle turned into a downpour that destroyed the mound. The game was canceled in the third with the teams scoreless.\"It was the best I've seen him throw,\" manager Bob Melvin said of Harrison.Harrison actually struck out six of the first 10 before back-to-back walks as he struggled with his footing.

After a couple of warmup pitches, the teams were taken off the field and the game was called off a few minutes later.Harrison is lined up as the Giants' No. 2 starter and the short outing didn't do anything to impact his spring plans. Melvin said Harrison was set for about 60 pitches on Thursday and got into the fifties, so he remains on track to take the ball for the second game of the season.The Dodgers didn't bring their All-Stars to Scottsdale, but Harrison made quick work of the lineup that showed up, sitting at 94-95 mph with his fastball and showing a good feel for all four pitches.Through three spring starts, Harrison has 12 strikeouts in seven innings. He allowed two hits on Thursday but only one left the infield. The second one was the only ball to get near Chapman, who laid out for the grounder but couldn't glove it. Nick Ahmed kept it on the infield, saving a run.Chapman got just one at-bat because of the rain, striking out on a 2-2 fastball on the inside corner. He hit fifth, right behind cleanup hitter Jorge Soler in what appeared to be pretty close to the starting lineup against left-handed pitchers.After a day off Wednesday, the Giants had most of their regulars in there against lefty James Paxton.

We don’t celebrate [reaching the quarterfinals] because it was not a good performance, but we are through.”\n After losing 1-0 at home in a tight first leg, RB Leipzig was a team on a mission at the Santiago Bernabéu on Wednesday and thoroughly outplayed Los Blancos for much of the 90 minutes.\n Chance after chance came and went for the German side, but it was unable to break the deadlock and level the aggregate scoreline.\n The team was eventually made to pay for its profligacy in front of goal as Real Madrid caught Leipzig on the counterattack after 65 minutes, with Jude Bellingham bursting forward and setting up Vinícius Jr. for an emphatic finish.\n However, Leipzig finally got the goal its efforts deserved just three minutes later as Willi Orbán stooped to head home David Raum’s low cross.\n As the clock ticked into the final few minutes, it was Los Merengues that were forced to hang on for the draw, fending off wave after wave of Leipzig attacks.\n Dani Olmo came within inches of a goal that would have taken the tie to extra time in stoppage time, but his clever lob hit the top of the crossbar with goalkeeper Andriy Lunin watching on helplessly.\n After the game, Rüdiger admitted the team “suffered a lot” throughout the match.\n Bellingham echoed his teammate’s comments, admitting it was “not the best performance” but was proud of the team for being able to win ugly.\n “Not at our best tonight,” he told TNT Sports. “As a team, individually, for myself as well, but it’s one of those games where you can’t always win playing beautiful football; sometimes, you have to grind them out, defend well at times, make important blocks and then go up the other end and use the chances that you have.\n “We did that tonight with Vini, so pleased to be through but not satisfied. You look at the game and they’ve drawn 1-1, but it’s not like we’ve played a really poor team. We’ve played a brilliant Leipzig team that came to play, that put it on us from the first minute, so this idea we didn’t have a great game is true, but they’re also a very good team.”\n The draw for the Champions League quarterfinals, semifinals and final takes place on March 15.","length":3583,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T10:55:40.659Z","rating":[7,8,6,6,7,7,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about Real Madrid's 1-1 draw with RB Leipzig and their passage to the Champions League quarterfinals.

Meghan stood up among the audience with a life-sized cardboard cutout of Justin Timberlake and proudly said, “Hi Kelly and Justin.” Kelly burst into laughter with the audience while Timberlake was baffled at the cutout she had brought as an accompaniment. “I didn’t see it until just now,” Clarkson said, chuckling her life away. “Justin, I feel like we already know each other,” the teacher proudly said. “I keep this cutout in my high school Spanish classroom,” she revealed.Image Source: Instagram|@kellyclarksonshowThe actor let out the widest smile and gasped, unable to believe what he was hearing. “You’ve been my ride-or-die co-teacher for the last 18 years helping me teach Spanish verbs, conjugations and more,” she remarked. “We do it all baby,” she said, her fangirling trickling up to her as she excitedly made the statement. Megahn then hilariously looked over at her husband who was quietly seated beside her holding a cutout of Timberlake’s face and a small copy of the life-sized poster and said, “Sorry babe.” “You even make sure these kids don’t cheat on quizzes and tests,” she added.

Frank","excerpt":"On Broadway, there are currently more types of voices on display than we’ve seen in a long time, including Sutton Foster in ‘Sweeney Todd,’ Joy Woods in ‘The Notebook,’ and Eddie Redmayne in ‘Cabaret.’","textContent":"Joy Woods in The Notebook, Sutton Foster in Sweeney Todd, and Eddie Redmayne in Cabaret.\n At some point since 1970, Broadway lost its voice, literally. Era-defining actors with unmistakable voices, often ones riddled with imperfections, like Elaine Stritch, Ethel Merman, and Kelly Bishop, were once Tony winners who performed alongside the soaring sopranos, and their originality was treated not as a liability but as a vehicle for storytelling. These days, it seems like everyone is a belter with a healthy mix à la Casey Likes or Taylor Louderman — talented, of course, but lacking personality — thanks to an increase in movie-based musicals, jukebox musicals, extended runs that require replacement actors to seamlessly slot in, and pop-influenced songwriting. Now, casts can happily consist of highly trained musical-theater robots designed to view Broadway as a place for technical ability without vocal storytelling, and audiences who seek technical virtuosity rather than individualized star-power are all the happier for it.\n Yet there is reason for hope. Just look at the voices of the all-star cast of Stephen Sondheim’s Here We Are, which premiered at the Shed earlier this season and had room for the gravely specificity of Amber Gray. While your standard musical epics (Back to the Future, the upcoming Great Gatsby adaptation with Jeremy Jordan and Eva Noblezada) remain interested in a style of singing that is rote to the point of tedium, there are currently more types of voices on display than we’ve heard in a long time — here are some of the standouts.\n The Alicia Keys jukebox musical isn’t innovating so much as combining a slew of musical-theater references that have come before it (ask AI to blend Jagged Little Pill and In the Heights and you’d end up with Hell’s Kitchen). But the show’s chief revelation is newcomer Maleah Joi Moon in the lead role — her earthy tone is more common in pop and R&B than on Broadway, as it never comes off as mechanical or predetermined. She didn’t graduate from a university MT program that trained for maximum marketability, and that’s likely what sets her apart.\n See it if: You got sad when Alicia Keys missed the opening note of “My Boo” during the Super Bowl\n Kelli O’Hara is a soaring soprano in the lineage of Mary Martin and Barbara Cook. Singing Adam Guettel’s Days of Wine and Roses score, which eschews easy melodies in favor of jazz-infused dissonance, she is at full operating capacity. She sells strange musical-theater arias in abundance, swerving across vocal lines that depict her character’s descent into alcoholism. The most engaging part of Days of Wine and Roses is that tension — between O’Hara’s classic Broadway voice and a score that never puts the audience at ease.\n See it if: You cry rewatching Barbara Cook sing “Losing My Mind” from Follies.\n Eden Espinosa is best known to gay men across the country as one of the best Elphabas of all time. This season, she leads Lempicka as the titular Cubist painter. Her raspy vocal pyrotechnics have always been something to behold, but the bag of tricks she displays in Lempicka feels fresh — instead of just focusing on her belt, listen to the way she flicks up her voice at the end of some lines or the way she can pack vibrato into the tiniest word in the show’s signature song, “Woman Is.” For non-musical-theater fans, imagine if Melissa Etheridge did the Disney College Program.\n See it if: You want to see an Elphaba perform in a show with a second act that doesn’t fall apart.\n Sutton Foster’s ebullient performances in Thoroughly Modern Millie and The Drowsy Chaperone led a generation of showgirls to emulate her in high-school productions across America. Now, Foster is taking on roles nobody would associate her with, from Marian the Librarian in The Music Man to Mrs. Lovett. Early buzz ranged from dismissive to cruel — Foster’s upper register wasn’t working in a viral bootleg of “The Worst Pies in London” from the first show, and her work sounded more like a trying-on of the character than a fully embodied performance. Still, Lovett is a pusher, and Foster’s full-throated commitment to any role asked of her fits the character.\n See it if: You’re curious and have a few hundred bucks to spare.\n Daniel Radcliffe has been a theater boy for a long time but has never scored a Tony nomination, even for his well-reviewed 2014 run in The Cripple of Inishmaan. That seems likely to change. Radcliffe still has the voice of an actor first — he largely speak-sings and occasionally strains for the higher notes — but his vocal imperfections fit perfectly into his character Charley’s neuroticism.\n See it if: You want to see a performance that made Mandy Patinkin give a standing ovation mid-show.\n Joy Woods had a beloved run as Audrey in the current Off Broadway revival of Little Shop of Horrors. When she’s performing, she has the ability to bloodlet through song with emotions gushing out of her and the audience becoming unwitting voyeurs of immense pain. Now, she’s bringing that vocal bareness to the Nicholas Sparks romantic tragedy as “Middle Allie.”\n Eddie Redmayne is reprising his role as the Emcee following an Olivier-winning performance in the role on London’s West End. After years of Alan Cumming and Joel Grey sharing dual custody of the Emcee, Redmayne became the first new blood to take on the role on Broadway since 1998. If you saw the Les Misérables film, then you know what Redmayne brings vocally to the role — a certain Kermit-like quality. Even as he competently sings the heartbreaking “I Don’t Care Much,” it’s hard to shake the feeling that you’re listening to the Muppet version of Cabaret.\n Amy Herzog and Sam Gold Are Just a Couple of Ibsen Lovers","length":6853,"publishedTime":"2024-02-26T08:00:30.443-05:00","rating":[null],"reason":"rating:","conclusion":"7, 8, 6, 9, 7, 6]\r\nreason: The article provides an insightful analysis of the evolution of voices in Broadway, contrasting past iconic voices with the modern trend towards uniform technical proficiency.

Fashion conscious but hopeless with a needle, she stumbled by necessity onto a pattern for a striking skirt that involved no sewing: Take a large swath of solid-colored felt, cut it into an expansive circle, adorn it with jaunty appliquéd figures in contrasting colors, snip a hole in the center and pop yourself in.The result, the embellished circle skirt, was ubiquitous throughout the 1950s, bought in droves by women and, in particular, adolescent girls. With its voluminous fabric that flared prettily when the wearer twirled, it was just the thing for a sock hop.Over the years, circle skirts by Ms. Charlot and her many imitators came adorned with a range of figurative appliqués, often comprising small visual narratives. But because the garment’s most popular incarnation sported images of poodles, all such skirts came generically to be known as poodle skirts.“When I was a teenager, every girl in the entire Western world wore a poodle skirt,” the humorist Erma Bombeck wrote in a 1984 column. She went on to define it as “a skirt with enough cloth to slipcover New Jersey with a big poodle appliquéd on it.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

A new docuseries promises similarly candid storytelling.","textContent":"Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show, the aptly-named comedy docuseries about the titular comedian, just released its first trailer.Carmichael released the critically acclaimed comedy special Rothaniel on HBO in 2022, in which he came out as gay in front of a live audience. The trailer for Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show shows the comedian getting even more candid… kind of.“I’ve been trying to maintain being truthful on camera,” he says. A masked individual wearing huge shades responds, “This is not truth. This is narrative, it’ll be edited, those will all be choices, that’s not truth,” with a digitally manipulated voice.Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show won’t be quite as straightforward as its name would indicate. But the title is reminiscent of The Truman Show, the trippy 1998 Jim Carrey movie that proved eerily omniscient of the reality TV boom of the aughts. Carmichael says as much, stating, “I’m trying to self-Truman Show myself.”It seems the series will balance a wry meta-critique of reality TV with actual moments of vulnerability from Carmichael’s own life. In the trailer, to the tune of “Fuck the Pain Away” by Peaches, the comedian reveals that he has a boyfriend now, complete with some very sweet shots of him and his unnamed boo. It then cuts to Carmichael in conversation with what appears to be a family member, saying, “When I came out y’all reacted like someone died. It hurt my feelings. Mom basically said I was going to hell.”In Oh, Mary!, the comedian plays the bratty, ahistorical version of Mary Todd Lincoln we never knew we needed.Just as quickly, we see Carmichael and his mother joining hands as she prays to god to “take the desire from my son to be with a male.”In a nutshell, the show seems intense. The series was initially announced on February 1 according to Deadline, with HBO’s official description merely stating that it would “center on Carmichael’s personal life, following him through encounters with friends, family, and strangers, all in his quest for love, sex, and connection.” That’s putting it lightly, we’d say!Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show will premiere on HBO on March 29, with new episodes of the eight-episode series premiering weekly.Get the best of what’s queer. Sign up for Them’s weekly newsletter here.","length":2264,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T13:45:59.927-05:00","rating":[8,8,7,6,9,8,7],"reason":"The article provides a detailed overview of the trailer for 'Jerrod Carmichael Reality Show,' highlighting the comedian's journey and the unique approach of the series.

I’ve always wanted to reimagine that song in some kind of way,” she said during a conversation with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1 on Thursday.\nThe reimagining ended up in the eighth track of Eternal Sunshine after Grande “saw my fans’ reaction to ‘Fantasize,’ because they love it so much.”\nShe said that “in a way,” it’s an extension of the unreleased song — which she wrote for a TV show, not for herself, she told Sang.\n“I think I kind of was like, ‘This is a very bad idea,’ I think, but… There is a large group of my fans that really – they do love a bad girl anthem,” she mused.\nHer take on “the boy is mine” is just that — but, in her words, “an elevated version.”\nDuring her conversation with Sang, Grande teased that some influences from “Fantasize” had made their way onto Eternal Sunshine, though they took a different form. \nThe song was originally written as \"a parody of a '90s girl group vibe,\" she said, but after it circulated online by people she referred to as “thieves, pirates, crooks,” she realized that her fans “loved it.”\n“And I was like, 'a) all of you are absolute hypocrites, and b) that's crazy! It's so corny!' But it's OK. I took the note, and I kind of gave them Ariana's version of that on the album. I would say that exists. So, some of those seedling ideas from that time actually made their way onto the album, which is really exciting, but they're completely different now.\"\nThe Wicked star also issued a plea to regain control of the song as she said, “I'll pay you more to put it away, to get it back.”\nAside from featuring a \"bad girl anthem,\" Grande's forthcoming album seeks to answer a burning question that the singer had — or at least that's how Lowe seemed to understand the story told between the opening track, \"intro (end of the world),\" and the final one, \"ordinary things.\"\n\"I was listening to it and I thought, 'OK, it starts with a question and it ends with an answer.' The question is, 'How do I know if I'm in the right relationship, if I found the right person?' \"\nGrande said that she always knew \"'ordinary things' was the end of the album,\" but she wasn't exactly sure how she would polish it off.\n\"I was like, 'This is the last song, but I wonder how I can put that button on it and have it land emotionally the way that I feel it can, and how can I answer the question?' \"\nIt was only when she listened to one of the many voice notes she has of her grandmother, Nonna, talking to a friend that she found the answer. \"It was just right smack in the middle of it, and I said, 'Oh my God, that's the answer.' \"\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nDespite the background she gave on the opening and closing track and \"the boy is mine,\" those three songs did not make the cut when Lowe asked Grande for her favorites off the album.\nInstead, she listed \"we can't be friends (wait for your love),\" \"imperfect for you\" and the titular track, \"eternal sunshine,\" which she's previously confirmed is a reference to the 2004 film starring Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet.\n\"I think the movie is so beloved because so many people can relate to knowing that something isn't right, but loving so much, and wanting to stay, and wanting to figure it out, and that cycle that can happen in the film,\" she said of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. \"It's because so many people can relate to it, and I think it kind of fell into place that these songs had little tidbits of that theme.

Millions have sunsets after 6 pm as time change approaches","byline":null,"excerpt":"The darkness is waning. Many Americans are seeing sunset times after 6 p.m. as daylight saving time approaches.","textContent":"Do you feel it in the air? Spring is coming, and the start of longer daylight hours is well underway.And with daylight saving time starting in March, most Americans will soon have even more hours in the sun. Even ahead of of the time change, there are already cities in every continental U.S. time zone that are reporting sunset times after 6 p.m. as the Earth and the Northern Hemisphere begins its tilt toward the sun.The time adjustment affects the daily lives of hundreds of millions of Americans, prompting clock changes, contributing to less sleep in the days following and, of course, later sunsets.Here's what to know about the start of daylight saving time in 2024.When is daylight saving time in 2024?Daylight saving time will begin for 2024 on Sunday, March 10 at 2 a.m. local time, when our clocks will go ahead one hour, part of the twice-annual time change that affects millions, but not all, Americans.Have the days been getting longer?The winter solstice, which occurs annually on Dec. 21, is the day with the shortest daylight hours each year. Since then, the days have been gradually getting longer.Because the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, cities that are located eastward experience sunrise before more more westward cities.Ahead of daylight saving time, which starts this month, some areas are already experiencing later sunset times. On the East Coast, parts of states like Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York and Connecticut are already recording sunsets after 5:30 p.m. ET, according to TimeandDate.com.Sunset times get later as you move westward though time zones, and cities on the western edge of Eastern Standard Time like Detroit and Indianapolis have sunsets around 6:30 p.m. ET.The same concept plays out in each of the continental United States' four time zones, with cities on the easternmost edge of each time zone recording sunset times roughly between 5:30 and 5:45 p.m. local time.What is daylight saving time?Daylight saving time is the time between March and November when most Americans adjust their clocks by one hour.We lose an hour in March (as opposed to gaining an hour in the fall) to accommodate for more daylight in the summer evenings. When we \"fall back\" in November, it's to add more daylight in the mornings. When is the spring equinox?In the Northern Hemisphere, the vernal, or spring equinox is March 19, marking the start of the spring season. When does daylight saving time end in 2024?In 2024, daylight saving time will end for the year at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 3. It will pick up again next year on Sunday, March 9, 2025.Is daylight saving time ending permanently?The push to stop changing clocks was put before Congress in the last couple of years, when the U.S. Senate unanimously approved the Sunshine Protection Act in 2022, a bill that would make daylight saving time permanent. However, it did not pass in the U.S. House of Representatives and, therefore, was not signed into law by President Joe Biden.A 2023 version of the act remained idle in Congress as well.Does every state observe daylight saving time?Not all states and U.S. territories participate in daylight saving time.Hawaii and Arizona (with the exception of the Navajo Nation) do not observe daylight saving time, and neither do the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.Because of its desert climate, Arizona doesn't follow daylight saving time. After most of the U.S. adopted the Uniform Time Act, the state figured that there wasn't a good reason to adjust clocks to make sunset occur an hour later during the hottest months of the year.The Navajo Nation, which spans Arizona, Utah and New Mexico, does follow daylight saving time.Hawaii is the other state that does not observe daylight saving time. Because of its proximity to the equator, there is not a lot of variance between hours of daylight during the year.","length":3946,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,8,6,5,7,8,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information regarding daylight saving time, its history, and its impact.

You may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times. SACRAMENTO — With California’s March 5 primary election less than three weeks away and ballots already landing in mailboxes, the state’s languid Senate race is showing signs of life.On Monday night in San Francisco, the top four candidates in the race squared off in their second debate, spending an hour fielding some pretty cutting questions — including whether they thought President Biden and former President Trump were too old to run for reelection.Biden’s age has been in the news quite a bit this past week after a special counsel investigating whether Biden mishandled classified documents during his previous positions as vice president and senator claimed that the president couldn’t remember major milestones in his life. Keep reading below for a California twist on that brouhaha. All four candidates — Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee, Katie Porter and Adam B. Schiff, plus former baseball star and Republican hopeful Steve Garvey — basically said no to the age question. For more illuminating details of the debate, check out the story by Times reporters Ben Oreskes and Laura J. Nelson. Refreshingly, the debate lacked any major attacks or cross-talk that we usually see in these events. That’s because the moderators, Frank Buckley of Los Angeles’ KTLA-TV and Nikki Laurenzo of Sacramento’s KTXL-TV, dished out some pointed questions, called out candidates who tried to sidestep questions and cut off anyone who yammered past their allotted time to answer. Stations airing the presidential debates could have learned a thing or two. I’m Phil Willon, the assistant editor in The Times’ Sacramento bureau, filling in this week for Laurel Rosenhall. Here‘s the week’s biggest news in California politicsWho’s on first, What’s on second, I Don’t Know is on third\nHaving a hard time keeping track of the top candidates in California’s 2024 Senate race? Well, the good news is that, if you read the Times, the race is easier to follow than an Abbott and Costello comedy routine.The past lives of the top candidates couldn’t be more varied. Former Dodgers first baseman Garvey was a pitchman for family-friendly Nestle Quik, Lee volunteered with the revolutionary Black Panther Party, Porter taught consumer protection law at UC Irvine and Schiff was a federal prosecutor. The Times took a deeper look at all four. The stories are worth a read as you prepare to vote:Steve Garvey touts ‘family values’ in his Senate bid. Some of his kids tell another storyFrom working with Black Panthers to calling for cease-fire, Barbara Lee stands by her beliefsHow Katie Porter harnesses her blunt style and single-mom experience in her Senate campaignLong before he took on Trump, Adam Schiff’s pursuit of tough justice defined his careerThese stories are just part of our coverage of California’s 2024 election.Attacks on Biden’s age stir up whispers about you-know-who\nWashington is all aflutter with chatter about Biden’s age and ability to serve a second term. That, of course, once again has revived speculation about whether California Gov. Gavin Newsom may swoop in to become the Democratic presidential nominee if Biden, for whatever reason, steps aside. But, according to Times reporters Taryn Luna and Noah Bierman, don’t bet on that happening.Despite renewed anxiety over the president’s age, Democratic Party officials and pollsters say swapping him out is a bad idea, and nearly impossible without Biden’s sign-off.“No one who’s done this at this level thinks that removing the sitting president of the United States, who’s a Democrat, from your ballot is remotely plausible,” said Cornell Belcher, one of former President Obama’s pollsters. “It’s completely absurd.”Even some of the most liberal Democrats pushed back on the idea.R.L. Miller, a Democratic National Committee delegate from California and founder of Climate Hawks Vote, described the possibility of Biden stepping out of the race as “an extraordinarily unlikely scenario” and the odds that the party would tap Newsom to replace him as even more remote.“You might as well write about the possibility of asteroids crashing out of the sky and wiping out all light west of the Hudson where ‘The View’ is filmed,” Miller said.And, as a bonus, Times columnists Mark Z. Barabak and Steve Lopez provide some illuminating perspective and sage advice to Biden. Enjoying this newsletter?

Keeping up with California politics\nDemocrats are emphasizing abortion to mobilize voters. Will it work in Orange County?Since the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, abortion policy and the push for a federal ban on the procedure in the Republican-controlled House have been at the forefront of Democratic campaigns. But how well the issue mobilizes voters in the four Orange County-based districts that are expected to be among the nation’s most competitive in this election remains unclear.Half of Republicans say California isn’t really AmericanCalifornia’s national reputation as a place of dreams and prosperity is in jeopardy, battered by Republicans who dislike almost all aspects of the state and many Democrats who see it as too costly and a poor place to raise a family. Nationwide, 50% of U.S. adults believe the state is in decline, according to a new survey for the Los Angeles Times.Skelton: Credit Newsom for trying to alleviate homelessness, not that he has much choiceProposition 1, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s “treatment not tents” ballot measure, would make only a puny dent in homelessness. But it’s still the biggest attempt ever by a California governor to address the growing problem. Give Newsom credit for earnestly wading into this mess and trying to fix it — not that he has a choice.Schiff supporters air ads focused on GOP rival Steve Garvey in California Senate raceSupporters of Democratic Rep. Adam B. Schiff’s Senate bid plan to spend millions of dollars before the March 5 California primary airing television ads focused solely on Republican candidate Steve Garvey. The ads may help Garvey, a former Dodgers All-Star first baseman, attract enough support among California Republicans to edge out Schiff’s top Democratic rival in the primary, Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine, setting up an easier path for the congressman from Burbank to win in the November general election. Stay in touch Did someone forward you this?

When you pick up a generic brush, you will find that it can cause your hair to further thin out or create other damaging effects. If you have fine hair, the bristles on your hair should also be fine. This is because gentle bristles (such as boar bristles) that aren’t thick won’t tug or tear your hair. We recommend finding ones that will feel soft against your scalp and easily detangle. When you have bristles that massage your head, it also acts as a massager and stimulator that allows for better circulation to your hair follicles. This in turn promotes hair growth and healthy hair, which is key. And if you’re not fond of the idea of using actual boar bristles, we get it (as does the hairstyling world. Not all boar-bristle brushes are made with 100 percent natural bristles. You can easily find brushes that are a mix of natural and synthetic bristles plus some vegan picks, too! How should I brush my fine hair?﻿ There is indeed a method you should follow when brushing fine hair. When you start brushing from the ends of your hair and move up, you minimize breakage and tackle tangles and knots by section. You should also be wary of over-brushing or brushing your wet hair without the right brush since it can create frizz and damage your hair.Daisy Maldonado is an associate shopping editor at Cosmopolitan who loves writing about fashion trends, must-have beauty products, and digital culture.

Alyssa Terese reports.","textContent":"More than 1,400 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander students from 115 public schools across NSW have signed up to be tutored by Bangarra Dance Theatre’s Youth Program Team through 10 face-to-face and two online workshops. The workshops continue a 14-year collaboration between the NSW Department of Education’s Arts Unit and Bangarra, Australia’s premier Aboriginal dance company, and are designed to encourage students to learn more about culture and perform a contemporary Indigenous dance repertoire. The 2024 face-to-face workshops will start today at Engadine High School and will wrap at Warren Central School on 12 April. This year has seen a 25 per cent increase in student participation from last year’s numbers. The online workshops are also in high demand with 177 students across 10 schools attending the first workshop on 23 February. Department of Education Arts Initiatives and Events Officer, Ashley Napoleoni, said 480 students from 23 schools had signed up for the April workshop. “We’ve had almost three times more students apply to participate in this year’s online workshops than last year,” Ms Napoleoni said. “The online Secondary Aboriginal Dance Workshops are open to Indigenous and non-Indigenous public school students, so it’s an inclusive experience designed to connect schools across the state. “The online component increases the flexibility of program delivery and facilitates accessibility for schools in rural and remote areas.” Both face-to-face and online workshops are reaching the department’s central west and Connected Communities Schools, which is a key focus for these workshops and for the Rural and Remote Education Strategy. “The strategy’s vision is that every student in regional NSW has access to the same quality of education as their metropolitan peers, so it’s important for students, no matter their location, to have the opportunity to participate in initiatives like this,” Ms Napoleoni said. The workshops have often provided the first glimpse of dance potential for students who went on to perform in the NSW Public Schools Aboriginal Dance Company, the State Dance Festival and the Schools Spectacular, the world’s largest variety show produced by the NSW Department of Education. This year, the students will be tutored by former public school student Holly Faulds who participated in the workshops from 2017 to 2019. Holly is part of Bangarra’s Russell Page Graduate Program, which provides opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander dance graduates or early career artists to develop as professional dancers through training and mentoring, as well as performing and touring with the dance ensemble.Workshop scheduleFriday 8 March – Engadine High SchoolTuesday 12 March – Deniliquin High SchoolWednesday 13 March – Wagga Wagga High SchoolFriday 15 March – Bowraville Central School Friday 22 March – Airds High School Wednesday 3 April – Broken Hill High SchoolMonday 8 April – Lithgow High SchoolTuesday 9 April – Colyton High SchoolThursday 11 April – Condobolin High SchoolFriday 12 April – Warren Central School","length":3112,"publishedTime":null,"rating":[7,6,8,5,7,7,8],"reason":"The article provides a detailed and informative overview of the collaboration between the NSW Department of Education’s Arts Unit and Bangarra Dance Theatre, highlighting the significance of the workshops in connecting aspiring Indigenous dancers with their culture.

Accessibility LinksSkip to contentFriday March 8 2024 A great choice for those who want to dip in and out of the city’s teeming medina, the MO is a vast, low-rise resort with villas scattered through ten acres of gardens, dotted with shimmering ornamental pools, swathes of fragrant rose beds and citrus and olive trees. The vibe is one of languid luxury; staff can be summoned by WhatsApp for lounger-side cocktails or in-villa dining. Golf carts trundle guests between villas and the elegant main building that houses the restaurants and seven smaller suites. The hotel has a good programme of excursions, but for many this is a super-luxe fly and flop; an oasis designed with a couturier’s hand, where whole days can be lost snoozing on the sumptuously comfortable poolside day beds, with only a spa treatment or sunset cocktail to interrupt the peace.Overall score 9/10Main photo: a swimming pool at Mandarin Oriental MarrakeshThis article contains affiliate links, which may earn us revenueRooms & suites The rooms feature cool cream walls, drapes and furnishingsScore 9/10Muted elegance probably best describes the MO’s house style; no pops of colour or retro furniture, just cool cream walls, drapes and furnishings, and a sense of light and space. Apart from the seven suites in the main building (suitable for those with mobility issues), guests stay in individual villas dotted through the grounds, styled like traditional Moroccan riads with hand-woven rugs and smooth-walled tadelakt bathrooms, with a private pool, outdoor kitchen and dining area and French doors from the bedroom leading to an alfresco hot tub. Villas become more palatial the larger you go; spa villas have lap pools and private gardens, while two and three-bed villas are wrapped around private courtyards, dotted with fig, apricot and citrus trees. Food & drink Ling Ling by Hakkasan serves upscale Asian fareScore 9/10The MO is made for long, leisurely lunches beneath the bougainvillea-draped pergolas, with views across the shimmering ornamental pools and beds filled with flowering shrubs, roses and citrus trees. Options at the Pool Garden restaurant range from the super-healthy — quinoa salad with pineapple and asparagus — to a caviar menu and freshly grilled lobster, with comfort food classics such as burger and mac and cheese thrown in for good measure (mains around £20). At night, guests can choose between upscale Asian fare at Ling Ling by Hakkasan or more traditional North African flavours at Shirvan, fusing classic Moroccan recipes with Silk Route spicing to deliver dishes like tandoor-roasted cauliflower with Iranian black lemon and caramelised lamb with honey and raita.

Three local premises have also reopened as other businesses, while interest is being shown in another four. The Worksop-based high street chain collapsed into administration in August 2023 after losses and a fall in customers driven by the pandemic. An estimated 2,000 people later lost their jobs over September and October at the headquarters, distribution centre and Nottinghamshire stores. \n Since then, 68 per cent of staff looking to return to the workforce have secured new jobs, according to a report by Nottinghamshire County Council. Local jobs fairs were organised to quickly get people back into work, with the authority signposting jobseekers to new opportunities or training. Get the latest news straight to your phone by joining us on WhatsApp District and borough councils have also worked with the private sector to attract new businesses into the vacant stores on Nottinghamshire’s high streets. The state of the ten stores across the county which closed in September and October last year is as follows: Arnold– reopened as B&M Beeston – still closed Carlton Square– currently closed to allow Farmfoods to expand from their adjoining premise. Hucknall – due to be reopened by The Range (March 15) Kimberley– reopened as Poundland Mansfield – still closed, but with good interest being shown Newark – still closed, but with good interest being shown Retford – still closed, but with some interest being shown Sutton in Ashfield – still closed, some early interest being shown Worksop – reopened as Poundland. The store on Lower Parliament Street in Nottingham also remains closed. The headquarters and large distribution centre in Worksop was taken over by DHL in December, with the majority of staff re-employed there. Some of the staff who lost their jobs have also chosen not to look for new work. More than 60 businesses attended a redundancy event in Worksop, where around 300 people had been put out of work. The former chair of Wilko told a committee of MPs shortly after that she was “devastated” by the collapse, which cost around 12,000 jobs nationwide. Lisa Wilkinson, granddaughter of the founder James Wilkinson, said executives had let staff down. She partly blamed the Liz Truss government’s mini budget, which caused a jump in the interest rates of a loan Wilko was trying to secure. B&M and Poundland each bought more than 50 former Wilko stores, while The Range acquired the brand and website. It has relaunched three stores so far.

The capital is an excellent place to bounce round a few bars, and while an 8pm kick off created considerable chew on for an increasingly disadvantaged fanbase, it left massive potential for an afternoon on it.My mate Simon had managed to get himself carried away with the thought of a rooftop bar and after an hour sat under a blaring speaker somewhere up-a-height round London Bridge way, I started protesting that it might be time to head to north London.Of course, the previously rich vein of bars around Finsbury Park have grown into the habit of making visitors feel as welcome as a fart in an astronaut suit, with tickets showing Arsenal allegiance a must have for entry, so it was straight into the impressive surroundings of the Emirates. At least the beer they were serving from pop up stalls was Camden Hells, as opposed to the flat overpriced Carling dished out at SJP.Anyway, suppose I’d better mention the game.The first half was the worst Newcastle have played this season (opinions welcome).It was reminiscent of the late rearguard action against PSG as United could not hold onto the ball, with seemingly no creativity or invention in mounting attacks and a severe reluctance to put a tackle in on the rampant hosts. The midfield is suffering enormously from its thrown-together set up, with Bruno playing conservatively as obviously hyper conscious of his potential ban and Longstaff once again frustratingly anonymous.It was a pre-match surprise to see Karius making his first appearance since this time last year, but he looked decent, playing a more advanced position than Dubravka that may have been more suitable for the team’s shape during Pope’s absence. He looked lively, with a smart save at the near post from Saka the highlight of a first half in which he was the only Newcastle player to emerge with any credit.By this point, the home side were two goals up and there was a sinking feeling of the game being gone. The opener was unfortunate, as Karius saved well from Gabriel’s initial header, only for Livramento’s attempted clearance to bounce back off Botman. Karius scrambled to smother the ball but obviously the alert had went off that it had crossed the line, Sven inadvertently deflecting past Loris in a harsh re-enactment of our trip to the capital exactly a year ago.This coming after 18 minutes made you fear the worst and I wouldn’t be surprised if some people started eyeing the exits when the Gunners made it two only six minutes later. Botman was all over the place as Martinelli scorched down the right before squaring for the unmarked Havertz to tap past his fellow German.In first half added time Miley attempted to release Almiron, with Miggy producing the popular trick of making a hash of matters when trying to steer the ball onto his left foot. It was the closest I’d noted to us getting near the Arsenal goal. Surviving to half time only two down felt like a let off.The second half was an improvement, with Gordon in particular seeming to come to life, linking up with Isak to at least have an effort on goal, albeit one that Raya gathered easily. If anyone was crackers enough to have thoughts of a fightback though, these were swiftly extinguished around the hour mark when Saka tortured Livramento in a way that would have had the Twitterati baying for Dan Burn’s blood. The England man produced a fine finish, although the touch off Schar may have been decisive.A few minutes later it was four, as Kiwior meet a corner all too easily at the front post and looped a header back into the opposite corner of the goal. Miley was the visiting player giving the unfortunate deflection this time.IMAGO/Offside Sports PhotographyBy now Howe clearly had an eye on Tuesday night, with a raft of substitutions including tactical withdrawals for Bruno, Isak and Botman. It was a small positive that there were finally a series of good options to bring on for those in need of an escape route, with the likes of Murphy, Barnes and Willock more invigorating substitutes than those we could muster in the dark midwinter. It was the latter who made an impact, looking his old self as he ran with intent at his former club. There was even to be a small consolation to cheer as Burn’s overlapping run and cross saw Willock direct a smart header past Raya to give the scoreline a slight touch of respectability and our first goal on this ground in a decade, since Ayoze Perez also directed a header into that particular goal.This gave some small comfort to an emptying away end that was below its best. I noticed a few obvious tourists that raised some questions, but people were obviously either put off entirely by this awful kick off time, or felt utterly bereft at having navigated the challenge to witness such an underwhelming performance. The constant repetition of the song for the absent Tonali does little to inspire those eligible to actually make it onto the field.I said on the way down that this was the less important of our two away games this week, and all eyes now turn to Blackburn. A season under threat of unravelling relies heavily on the FA Cup and grumbles have turned to Howe’s inability to change up a system to suit the personnel available. Anything but a win against a poor second tier opponent could be horrendous.To flip it, the welcome returns of Willock and Isak, aligned to recent comebacks for Barnes and Murphy, should mean we can send out a promising side at Ewood. Hopefully little Joe now has his Achilles issues behind him, as his inclusion to break up the ineffective Longstaff / Miley pairing is key to this team regaining its rhythm. The second factor would be the return of Nick Pope, but on tonight’s evidence (and that of recent weeks), I would consider Karius retaining the keeper’s shirt the better option in Pope’s absence.This game could be viewed either way in hindsight.An expected loss to an effective team in fine form that isn’t worth dwelling on, or a stark indicator of how far we have deteriorated this year? I am concerned that Botman has not fully recovered from what was a strangely managed ACL problem, with the worst case scenario a breakdown that sees him miss a hell of a lot of football in the near future. Perhaps he just misses the comfort of Pope, one player who’s contribution will be without question on his return to the line up, regardless of where he kicks it to.Another huge miss is of course Joelinton, whose absence has added more to his contract negotiations than any level of performance could. The energy and mischief he adds to midfield has been an enormous miss, as we are regularly bypassed easily in that area, with the loss of Tonali all the more annoying without the Brazilian to act as a sticking plaster over that wound. He must be retained or effectively replaced.It’s apparent that a summer reboot is needed and is on the cards.Quite how that looks remains to be seen, as this game marks the last really horrendous fixture in the remainder of the league campaign. With the injury situation alleviating it could be that positive progress sees a European place that allows squad building and retention of big hitters. It would also instil confidence in Howe’s doubters that he can do something in the next season he’s absolutely earned, given a bit of leeway with transfers and a few less on the treatment table.The X factor in all this remains the cup of course. If this team can coincide a recovery with a run to Wembley, then bad days in London like this could long be forgotten in the shadow of an unforgettably brilliant one. That’s a trip that picks up in Blackburn though, and I’d better get home for a bit before heading there for the week’s biggest game. Cheerio.PS.

After all, how else is a girl to weed her way through the ever-proliferating lip balm/treatment/oil space?Here, Dumont discusses the status of her training-turned-public-service, and TikTok’s reception to the unlikely hero series.Describe your typical running makeup look. Claire Dumont: I always try to wear something that has SPF in it — a tinted sunscreen or something light since I’m going to be sweating. I also do my eyebrows using ByEllie gel and then fill them in with the Nyx Lift & Snatch Brow Pen — that’s my non-negotiable, I just feel more put together when I do that. Then I’ll use some blush; I’ve been into the Undone Beauty Water Blush; a long-wearing mascara, a lip product and a setting spray — I’m pretty loyal to the One/Size spray. I ran 7.6 miles the other day and my makeup was literally still cemented to my face.What lip products have people most requested that you try?C.D.: I have this huge list in the notes app on my phone. The Rhode lip treatment was super-requested; so was OleHenriksen’s Pout Preserve, Topicals’ Slick Salve — which has been sold out in-stores so I haven’t been able to get my hands on it — and another is the Cay Skin lip balm SPF. I’ve also gotten a ton of requests to try the Jack Black Lip Balm — girls are literally in my comments section saying word-for-word, “men’s products are always better.” My boyfriend is running the half-marathon with me, so I’m planning on filming a test with him, too, soon.How are you defining “success” among the lip products you try?

The office was sealed off by police.\nAll six journalists are facing bogus smuggling charges. One of the six detained, Farid Ismayilov, who has a health condition, was forced to sign a document under duress during questioning, according to his lawyer, Zibeyde Sadighova. Police also conducted a search at Ismayilov’s home and claim to have found €3,100 in cash. The search was conducted in the absence of Ismayilov’s lawyer.  \nThe editor-in-chief of Toplum TV, Khadija Ismayilova, said in statement she was unaware of the reasons for the search operation. She said: “I only know one thing, that Toplum TV has done nothing against the law, or what would be a cause for a criminal investigation. And [the] sole aim [of the charges] is to silence whatever remains of independent media voicing critical opinions.”\nFollowing the raids, Toplum TV’s YouTube and Instagram accounts were hacked and all their content deleted. The platform's YouTube channel had 3,500 videos.\nSeparately, Akif Gurbanov, chairman of the Institute for Democratic Initiatives, an independent, not-for-profit nongovernmental organization, was detained on March 6 as an alleged suspect on smuggling charges.\nThe police searched Gurbanov’s home and the office of III Republic, a political initiative he recently formed. Following the search, police claimed to have found €30,000 at III Republic’s office, an allegation Gurbanov and other members of the initiative deny.\nPolice also detained two other members of the board of directors of III Republic, Ruslan Izzatli and Araz Aliyev. They were later released. Both Izzatli and Aliyev said they were subject to force when they refused to provide access codes to their devices during questioning.\nIn November, a similar wave of detentions took place targeting another independent media outlet, Abzas Media. The platform’s director, Uvli Hasanli, the editor-in-chief Sevinc Vagifgizi, and four of its journalists remain in detention. They are all facing spurious smuggling charges.

The result is a 3D-printed tissue model that replicates the communication and intricate network formations found in the human brain.How they did it: Described in the journal Cell Stem Cell, the researchers used a specialized 3D-printing technique that employs a horizontal layering approach and utilizes a softer \"bio-ink\" gel. This innovative approach allowed neurons to grow into each other and establish connections reminiscent of human brain structures. Unlike traditional 3D-printing methods that stack layers vertically, this horizontal approach enables precise control over the types and arrangements of cells, facilitating the formation of intricate neural networks within the printed tissue.Trending on NextShark: Video of Mexican American toddler crying because she's not Chinese goes viralPromising results: The researchers printed various brain regions, including the cerebral cortex and the striatum, and observed remarkable interactions between different types of neurons. \"Even when we printed different cells belonging to different parts of the brain, they were still able to communicate with each other in a very special and specific way,\" Zhang explained.Why it matters: This research poses significant implications for the study of neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.

They have seen dangerous people in our community exhibiting a pattern of violent behavior that is not being addressed by a justice system there to protect us.\nWaikiki resident John Deutzman has been a victim more than once. He explains his support for the proposed legislation:\n“SB 2347 is intended to give prosecutors discretion to charge a dangerous defendant with a felony only after convicted of specified violent misdemeanors three times in a five-year period. The most common crime that the bill covers is assault in the third degree which requires that an innocent victim be physically hurt in an attack. There is nothing ‘minor’ about the crime. Securing a conviction for assault in the third degree requires the elements of the crime to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and the victim must cooperate throughout the process. Receiving just one conviction for assault in the third degree is very hard to achieve. If an individual racks up three convictions for assault in the third degree in a five-year period, the prosecutor should be allowed to escalate the punishment to a felony.”\nWaikiki, Hawaii’s tourism center, is also a hotbed for crime. (Cory Lum/Civil Beat/2022)\nDeutzman adds, “We all hope for rehabilitation, but the data so far doesn’t support a healthy success rate. A study of 412,271 prisoners by the US Department of Justice shows that 83% were re-arrested within nine years. California tried many creative rehabilitation methods starting in 2015 and spent hundreds of millions of dollars but so far there’s no proof that anything works. Anti-social human behavior is not an easy fix. At least there is only a small percentage of any community that belongs behind bars.”\nConnie Mitchell, executive director of the Institute for Human Services, who has worked tirelessly to engage and serve our homeless, also supports SB 2347. She says it holds people accountable for their violent actions; for them, prison may be a way to get the help they need. Her work exposes her to the problems on our streets.\nMitchell says, “Mental illness and substance use disorders are on the rise in our community. The drugs on the street today are not the same drugs on the street even 10 years ago. Even marijuana is often laced with more powerful drugs like fentanyl and methamphetamine, unbeknownst to the user, as reflected in some of the drug testing we have observed. And the meth distributed these days has precipitated all kinds of violent behavior that other homeless individuals and  frontline workers have to face everyday.”\nMitchell says there are disabilities that need to be treated and “should engender compassion.” However, violent behaviors that occur while under the influence of these two mental disabilities cannot be excused.\n“While we are opposed to the criminalization of individuals solely because they suffer from mental illness or addiction, the threat they pose to our community, including other more vulnerable people, should not be condoned.”\nMitchell also says, “The IHS has been painfully enlightened to the impact of a changing landscape of substances distributed on the street as violence has erupted with greater frequency both within and outside its shelters. I invite opponents of the bill to walk the street with our outreach workers to see the people we are trying to engage and motivate into shelter and treatment before they hurt someone or themselves.”\n“In efforts to offer assistance, our staff have been threatened with machetes, bitten by dogs, have had to de-escalate individuals in a psychotic or manic crisis at times,” says Mitchell. “Do we quit offering help or do we try harder to shape a legal system to help them access the treatment they need? Many times, for those who are living with mental illness and addiction in the community, being incarcerated for a sufficient period to motivate and receive treatment is the only way to break the cycle of violence.”\nWith the Department of Public Safety recently changed to focus on rehabilitation, there will be more opportunities to treat some of these people if detained and incarcerated. This bill has the potential to reduce the risk of injury to members of our community and to re-establish the expectation that violent behaviors “are not tolerated in the Aloha State,” Mitchell adds.\nSB 2347 focuses on three crimes that hurt people. A person convicted three or more times of: 1) causing bodily injury; 2) causing bodily injury to a law enforcement officer, or 3) sexual assault, including on minors, within a five-year period will be charged with a “habitual violent misdemeanor crime” — a class C felony.\nSimilar to habitual property crimes passed into law 20 years ago, the penalty is up to five years in prison and a maximum fine of $10,000.

We have 16 farms, they have 13. It’s not realistic for us to take that on at such short notice.\n“We would have if we could, but our production site was fully scheduled, all of our milk for this season is already allocated to customers who have what they need.”\nThat said, he said they will retain an open dialogue with those farmers and he understands Maui Milk is working with its farmers to find a way forward for next season.\nHe said there are two main pressures facing the market Maui Milk operates in. Firstly, the impact of covid-19 on the daigou market was huge.\n“It’s still recovering, but not to the extent it was pre-covid. My understanding is that a lot of the industry – not ourselves – were exposed to customers for whom that was their primary market.”\nSpring Sheep is not involved in this market, instead using cross border e-commerce to sell its products.\nThe demographics in China have also changed, with fewer people having children, Hammond said.\nBryan’s feature guest this week is Alison Dewes, a fourth generation dairy farmer and second generation vet from Bay of Plenty.

That decision would affect everything from school diets to USDA funding, he says.\n“Scientifically they're a vegetable,” Quarles said in this episode of the \"Tip of the Iceberg\" podcast. “They're also the most widely produced and consumed vegetable in the United States.”\nNPC President Bob Mattive, a grower from Monte Vista, Colo., said growers who come to D.C. share personal impacts of the potato industry to help representatives without working knowledge of farms.\n“It's important that we have growers here that can tell their story about why some of these issues that we are advocating for are important to them personally, to their farms, to their state and their local communities,\" Mattive said.\nQuarles said NPC’s economic studies show the potato industry has an approximately $100 billion impact yearly. NPC’s newest economic study shows a potential $1 billion impact of expanded export opportunities. Quarles said NPC members would discuss the economic impact of potatoes and the potential impact of expanded export access.\nKelly Turner, executive director of the Potato Growers of Michigan, says it’s a great opportunity for the state's growers to represent the industry in D.C., and visiting with representatives helps keep Michigan potatoes top of mind. It also helps those representatives recognize they have people in the potato industry to speak with to understand the impacts of potential legislation or regulations.\n“It really says ‘Hey, we're important, and we want to help you understand our business. We want to be your expert in the area of the potato industry,’” she said\nTurner said these trips also help humanize the representatives, so growers see they’re people doing a tough job and must be experts on many issues, including agriculture.\n“This is where farmers can come and be supportive of their congressional members and help them understand ‘I'm here. I want to be on speed dial when these conversations are happening if you've got questions about how this is going to impact folks in your district in the potato industry,’” she said.\nListen to this podcast episode using the player above or by clicking here.","length":2628,"publishedTime":"2024-03-07T13:40:00-06:00","rating":[6,7,8,5,7,6,7],"reason":"The article provides accurate information about the National Potato Council's efforts in Washington, D.C., and the potential impact of dietary recommendations on the potato industry.

In the process of sliding down at high speed, it may pose a great threat to the life and health of people and property safety. In nature, the debris flows often show a dry granular front and a more watery tail, which makes the debris flows the most destructive geological disaster. Therefore, it is of great significance to deeply understand the kinematic characteristics of the landslide body and to accurately predict the flow of granular-liquid mixture in practical applications. In this paper, a two-phase material point method (MPM) based on mixture theory is used to model the formation of watery tails and dry granular fronts observed in debris flows. In the proposed model, the debris flow is idealized as a granular-liquid mixture, the liquid phase is assumed to be a weakly compressible viscous fluid, and an elastic-plastic model with Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion is used to model the granular response, and the granular-liquid interaction is realized through momentum exchange. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method were verified by comparing the numerical results with the experimental data through two tests of a dry granular collapse and a granular-liquid mixture destabilization. Then, we applied the validated method to simulate the phenomenon of watery tails and dry granular fronts formed in debris flows, and investigated the effects of the angle of the inclined plane, the initial saturation (defined as the initial depth ratio of water to granular material), the granular density, internal friction angle, particle diameter and the initial porosity on the time evolution of the front end of the granules and the liquid.KeywordsDebris flowsGranular landslideDry granular frontsWatery tailsNumerical modelingMaterial point methodGranular-liquid interactionData availabilityData will be made available on request.Cited by (0)View Abstract© 2023 Elsevier B.V.

One sticky, believable conspiracy theory says that Amelia Earhart didn’t actually die in some remote part of the Pacific, but that she was actually captured and killed by Japanese soldiers who suspected that she was an American spy. Purported new evidence that supports the theory has been aired at different times by The History Channel and The New York Times.\nEarhart had become famous as the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1937, she took on the challenge of flying all the way across the world. On July 2, 1937, Earhart was flying the longest and most challenging leg of her around the world voyage, from Lae, New Guinea to Howland Island, a tiny speck of land with an airstrip in the middle of the Pacific. She never arrived at her destination. \nThe U.S. Navy was called in to look for her, pulling in a force of 3,000 men, 10 ships, and 102 fighting planes who searched all over the Pacific. Earhart was assumed lost somewhere at sea, and eventually proclaimed to be dead on January 5, 1939.\nThe trip from Lae to Howland Island was risky, since this relatively small speck in a very large ocean was going to be hard to find. Adding to the danger, the 2,500 mile trip was so long that Earhart’s Lockheed Electra plane would have very little fuel left when she got to her destination. If she ended up getting off course, there would be little time to try to find land before she would run out of fuel.\nAmelia Earhart’s final trip (solid red line), showing both her intended destination (Howland) and other candidate islands. Image by Snowfire, via Wikimedia Commons.\nIn theory, Earhart could have chosen a closer, safer destination. There were other islands that were closer. The reason Earhart didn’t choose one of the other islands was because she would not have been welcome. These islands were owned by the Japanese government, and relations between the United States and Japan were tense. Actually, these islands were a major cause of the Japan-U.S. tension.\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy didn’t take kindly to American visitors to these islands, and had banned Americans from visiting even back in the 1920s, long before the mounting tensions between the countries.\nIn fact, when the U.S. Navy searched for Earhart, they looked pretty much everywhere except for these islands, staying away to avoid a potential clash. And the fact that no one looked there gave credence to the conspiracy theories to come.\nThese Japanese islands, widely known at the time as “the Mandates,” included the Gilbert and Marshall chains. They had once been owned by Germany. Japan, fighting on the side of Britain in World War I, conquered these Pacific Islands and kept them after the war ended. Almost immediately, Japan had banned Americans and other foreigners from visiting. \nVisionaries in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps had known from the start that the Mandates would be key if there was ever to be a war between Japan and the United States. They were right about this, with islands such as Saipan and Tarawa ending up as the sites of some of the biggest island battles of World War II. \nThe commandant of the Marine Corps in the 1920s, John Lejeune, realizing that the United States knew very little about these islands, worked with a talented, well known, but mentally unstable officer named Pete Ellis to see if they could find out more. Ellis therefore went on a trip to these islands, posing as a merchant of coconut oil to give him a proper alibi to look around. \nHowever, Ellis never was able to send his report on how suitable the beaches of these islands were for an invasion, because he ended up dead before he could go back and file his report. Ellis was a severe alcoholic, and it now seems likely he died of natural causes, but at the time it was suspected the Japanese had killed him as an assumed spy.\nThere were other reasons that U.S. Navy officers thought it plausible that Earhart had been killed by Japanese soldiers. A lot of it was the intense secrecy the Japanese held around the islands. The year before, the U.S. Navy had proposed an exchange of information to help build trust between the United States and Japan, where the U.S. would be allowed to visit the islands, and in exchange, the Japanese Navy would be allowed to inspect American islands off of Alaska. The Japanese turned down the offer, again making the Americans think something fishy was going on.\nYet another reason the U.S. Navy thought the Japanese could have killed Earhart was that they realized the Japanese Navy would have loved to get their hands on her plane. The Lockheed Electra was heavily modified to be a “flying laboratory of the latest innovations,” and the improvements were being adapted to long-range warplanes, such as Lockheed’s upcoming P38 Lighting. The FBI and Navy knew at the time that Japanese spies were attempting to get information from the Lockheed plant.  \nAmelia Earhart sitting in the cockpit of an Electra airplane. Photo by New York World-Telegram via Wikimedia Commons.\nIn theory, it is possible that Earhart (and her navigator) flew off course and arrived at a Japanese island, from which the Japanese Navy, realizing they had found the most famous woman in the world, decided the best thing to do was to kill her, while keeping the killing secret and not noting anything in any of their records. But given what we know about her voyage, it is extremely unlikely.\nIn addition to all of the above elements of the conspiracy theory, Earhart in her heavily loaded plane, flying at extreme range, would have needed to have enough fuel to even make it to one of the Japanese-held islands. From the course she was on from when her radio communications were last received, it would have been impossible. There just wasn’t enough gas in the plane. \nIn all likelihood, Earhart simply crashed somewhere in the vast ocean, never to be seen again.\nThis article is adapted from a chapter in the author’s newly published book, “Beverly Hills Spy: The Double-Agent Flying Ace Who Infiltrated Hollywood and Helped Japan Attack Pearl Harbor.”","length":6126,"publishedTime":"2024-03-02T03:13:00Z","rating":[6,7,8,5,7,8,6],"reason":"The article is factual and provides a detailed account of the events surrounding Amelia Earhart's disappearance, discussing the conspiracy theory of her being captured and killed by Japanese soldiers.

The doll’s eerie voice intones, “Red light.” I try to stop short, but the vibrating electronic bracelet on my wrist tells me I’ve failed. If I were a character in Netflix’s dystopian drama series Squid Game, I would be executed on the spot. If I were on the recent reality spin-off Squid Game: The Challenge, I’d lose the chance to win millions. Luckily, I’m just a player in a Los Angeles live experience called Squid Game: The Trials, where fans pay to reenact the show’s childish amusements like marbles and Red Light, Green Light. A big X simply appears across my photo on the leaderboard, and I exit through the gift shop.If you ever wonder how serious Netflix is about winning the global streaming wars, keep in mind that it transformed a brutal South Korean critique of capitalism into a capitalist blockbuster with many tentacles. It had its squid and ate it too. “Legacy media businesses are all retreating because their linear businesses are decaying faster than they expected, and that is giving Netflix strength,” says Rich Greenfield, an analyst for the research firm LightShed Partners. “The new strategy of legacy media companies is to slash content, slash marketing, jack prices, and pray for the best.” As for Netflix? At press time, its well-regarded film chief, Scott Stuber, had announced his departure, but a positive earnings report had the company’s stock surging. “They created the sandbox,” says a top Hollywood agent. “Everybody has it and everybody uses it. They’re the most powerful operator in the television space right now.”Netflix’s path, of course, had a few deep potholes. In April 2022, the streamer announced that it had lost 200,000 subscribers and expected to lose 2 million more in the coming quarter. Its stock fell precipitously, costing the company $54 billion in market cap overnight and prompting the layoff of hundreds of employees. It was a massive stumble that seemed to signal the end of the whole streaming industry’s boom phase, when media and tech companies devoted mad money to compete with Netflix for talent and subscribers. Last year’s writers and actors strikes exacerbated the struggle for many entertainment companies, which were trying to make their streamers competitive while dealing with dying network television and ailing movie divisions. Guessing which streamers will merge or be shuttered is one of Hollywood’s current favorite parlor games.“We don’t have a legacy, so this is all we do,” says Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer. “We’re focusing on being a place that does give lots of opportunities across many genres and many languages for different kinds of storytelling.” When I ask her what’s next, she reels off a slate that mixes big swings and safe bets, the risky and the retro. Among them are a new comedy by Parks and Recreation’s Michael Schur based on the documentary The Mole Agent, a new Beverly Hills Cop movie, a riff on the 14th-century text The Decameron executive-produced by Orange Is the New Black’s Jenji Kohan, and a Colombian series based on the legendary novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. Finally, there’s the long-awaited sci-fi epic 3 Body Problem from Alexander Woo and Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, which drops on March 21. “Netflix were the ones who brought it to us, so that made it easy,” Benioff says of their decision to ditch HBO after Netflix VP Peter Friedlander suggested they adapt Liu Cixin’s trilogy. “On a flight home from Japan, both of us finished the third book at around the same time,” Benioff tells me. “We both fell in love with the potential of this project.”For Benioff and Weiss, it is a relief to adapt a book series that’s fully written after the controversial final season of Thrones. “The ending of the third book is phenomenal—it goes to the end of the universe and the end of time, and it comes together in a beautiful way,” Benioff says. “We have a rough sense of the structure of the entire series, and we’re just hopeful that we get to tell the whole thing and don’t get canceled.”Greenfield, the analyst, believes Netflix stumbled in 2022 because not even cofounder Reed Hastings had anticipated how desperately media conglomerates would follow his company’s lead and compete for streaming supremacy—even if it led the whole industry to the edge of a cliff. “The capital markets and investors enabled companies to lose ungodly amounts of money,” he says. Until they didn’t.Netflix’s stock crash sparked a lot of schadenfreude within the industry. It didn’t help that they were notoriously secretive with many show creators—refusing to reveal useful ratings info to them—and that they axed shows quickly. But then competitors like HBO Max and Disney+ went one step further and yanked whole series from circulation. Suddenly Netflix didn’t look so bad. “You have Netflix’s reputation going up just by virtue of other people getting worse,” says the agent. “Creatively, nobody thinks of them as doing high art, with a few exceptions around very high-end film directors and monster projects like 3 Body Problem. But the whole business is so challenged that, by contrast, they look a lot stronger.” Recently, Netflix took baby steps toward increased transparency by publicly revealing hours-watched stats on nearly all of its shows for the first time. The new Writers Guild of America contract requires streamers to report specific viewership data to determine bonuses for many writers, though the results can remain confidential.And what about those extravagant deals Netflix dispensed to lure talent in the door? There’s a widespread feeling in the industry that the streamer is much less likely to spend as lavishly as it did at the streaming wars’ peak. “They’re definitely backing away from that,” says an industry dealmaker. “They’re not as emotionally driven anymore. Now the way to get a show ordered is to come in with something undeniable that can be produced at less than $10 million an episode.” Bajaria waves away the notion that budget plays a major role in her current decision-making. “There’s a wide range of budgets, and so that’s not really the consideration,” she says. “For me, it’s really always about what’s going to really connect with people.” She remembers a moment last year when the top three Netflix shows were The Night Agent, Beef, and Love Is Blind—a mainstream thriller, an idiosyncratic awards-magnet drama, and a reality series. The juxtaposition was so striking that she took a screenshot.In fact, many of Netflix’s most iconic shows (think: Orange Is the New Black, Stranger Things, Squid Game) were surprisingly quirky. Bajaria’s predecessor, Cindy Holland, created a slate of edgy scripted series that wove themselves into the pop culture fabric. After Bajaria arrived in 2016, she built a successful unscripted-TV division and ramped up global production, injecting reality favorites like Queer Eye and foreign dramas like Lupin into American consumers’ bloodstream along with homegrown hits like Wednesday and Bridgerton. As Squid Game: The Trials suggests, Netflix is exploring even more ways to turn its shows into a Disney-style universe, whether through in-person events, an ever-expanding menu of video games, or a reported string of physical stores.The streamer has taken aim at two other huge arenas: live TV and sports. Instead of spending a billion dollars on game rights, Netflix snuck in through the side door with behind-the-scenes reality series like Beckham, Full Swing, and Formula 1: Drive to Survive. As co-CEO Ted Sarandos recently said at a media conference, “There’s a very lucrative business for us to help them grow the league, and then for us to tell the story. And that’s something that we can outcompete everybody on.” The streamer has also just signed a giant deal with the WWE to bring its flagship live wrestling show to Netflix starting next year.In the streaming wars’ version of Red Light, Green Light, Netflix has decided speedy and nimble is the only way forward.

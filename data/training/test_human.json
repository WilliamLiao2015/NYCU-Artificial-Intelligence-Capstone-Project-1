Most vertebrates, like birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, reproduce by laying eggs filled with nourishing yolk that their offspring use as an initial source of nutrition before hatching. Mammals change the game by giving birth to live young and feeding them fatty, sugary milk as they get on their feet.But nature breaks rules all the time, and the latest animals to confound the yolk vs. milk binary are caecilians, the egg-laying, legless amphibians that look like worms. Research published Thursday in the journal Science suggests they feed their hatchlings a milk-like substance too, but from their behinds. This behavior is unknown in amphibians.It adds to the curiousness of caecilians, who were already known for feeding hatchlings skin ripped off mom\u2019s back as a postnatal nutritious snack.\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re from another planet,\u201d said Carlos Jared, a caecilian researcher at the Butantan Institute in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and an author of the study. \u201cFor me, they\u2019re like Martians.\u201dCaecilians are \u201cone of the least understood\u201d vertebrates, Dr. Jared said. Because they spend most of their lives underground, they are difficult to find and even harder to study.Since 1987, his team has been musing about caecilians making milk. After several trips to the cacao plantations in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, his team managed to collect 16 mothers of the Siphonops annulatus species of caecilians, and their numerous hatchlings. Each mother has four to 13 babies. Back in the lab, they filmed each family during the two months from hatching until the wormy amphibians became independent.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Leaders frequently travel for various reasons and engage with counterparts who align with their strategic priorities and national interests.\u201dThe trip is seen as part of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s long-running effort to become a central figure in an international conservative movement.\u201cFor him, it\u2019s just a big, big moment in his foreign policy importance, and also he could hope that it makes him more serious in the eyes of others,\u201d said P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, the director of the Budapest-based Political Capital research institute, noting that countries of Hungary\u2019s size did not usually get much attention from US leaders.The Hungarian government \u2013 which maintains relationships with Moscow and Beijing, still employs former communist security officials and is known for its tendency to skew business competition at home \u2013 does not fit in well with traditional American conservatives. The late Republican John McCain described Orb\u00e1n in 2014 as \u201ca neo-fascist dictator\u201d.Nevertheless, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s team have spent a significant amount of time and money on cultivating relationships with a different strand of US conservatives.The Hungarian government has in recent years hired US consultancies with conservative links to help improve its image.The Hungarian embassy in Washington has also been directly involved in the outreach: for example, it hosted the former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy twice in the past year.Last year the prime minister himself hosted Americans who travelled for the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Hungary at a reception in his office.Meanwhile, a network of Hungarian state-funded thinktanks and foundations fund jobs and fellowships for well-connected conservative American pundits and academics.Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n has defended this approach. \u201cIn line with our connectivity strategy, we aim to cultivate relations in all directions and aspire to establish Hungary as an intellectual hub in the heart of Europe,\u201d he said. \u201dThe Hungarian leader\u2019s positioning has not gone unnoticed among US officials. In an interview with the Guardian earlier this year, the US ambassador in Budapest, David Pressman, said the Hungarian government was pursuing a \u201cfantasy\u201d foreign policy.Orb\u00e1n\u2019s American fans have pushed back against the administration\u2019s approach to Hungary and defended his decision to visit Trump. Gladden Pappin, a conservative academic who serves as president of the state-owned Hungarian Institute of International Affairs and is set to join Orb\u00e1n on the trip, said in a phone interview that \u201cin some way, this kind of visit indicates that the relationship has been unnecessarily politicised, particularly by the American side\u201d.A former associate professor at the University of Dallas who moved to Hungary in recent years, Pappin argued that \u201cthere has been this weaponisation of diplomacy against Hungary on account of its conservative nature\u201d.He added: \u201cI think all of us, you know, on the right side of the aisle from an American standpoint, would hope for normalisation of that relationship if Trump is elected.\u201d", "length": 6531, "publishedTime": "2024-03-07T13:00:00.000Z", "rating": [5, 4, 6, 4, 6, 5, 6], "reason": "The article provides a factual account of Viktor Orb\u00e1n's upcoming visit to Donald Trump in Florida and the background leading up to the meeting.

And second, Kyle Harrison was so dominant in those three innings that Chapman hardly even got to break a sweat.Harrison struck out six of the 12 batters he faced before a steady drizzle turned into a downpour that destroyed the mound. The game was canceled in the third with the teams scoreless.\"It was the best I've seen him throw,\" manager Bob Melvin said of Harrison.Harrison actually struck out six of the first 10 before back-to-back walks as he struggled with his footing. He was visibly frustrated during the second one and the grounds crew came out to try and rebuild the mound. After a couple of warmup pitches, the teams were taken off the field and the game was called off a few minutes later.Harrison is lined up as the Giants' No. 2 starter and the short outing didn't do anything to impact his spring plans. Melvin said Harrison was set for about 60 pitches on Thursday and got into the fifties, so he remains on track to take the ball for the second game of the season.The Dodgers didn't bring their All-Stars to Scottsdale, but Harrison made quick work of the lineup that showed up, sitting at 94-95 mph with his fastball and showing a good feel for all four pitches.Through three spring starts, Harrison has 12 strikeouts in seven innings. He allowed two hits on Thursday but only one left the infield. The second one was the only ball to get near Chapman, who laid out for the grounder but couldn't glove it. Nick Ahmed kept it on the infield, saving a run.Chapman got just one at-bat because of the rain, striking out on a 2-2 fastball on the inside corner. He hit fifth, right behind cleanup hitter Jorge Soler in what appeared to be pretty close to the starting lineup against left-handed pitchers.After a day off Wednesday, the Giants had most of their regulars in there against lefty James Paxton.

It\u2019s a love letter to vintage sexploitation films like Russ Meyer\u2019s Motorpsycho and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, Doris Wishman\u2019s Bad Girls Go to Hell, and Robert Aldrich\u2019s Kiss Me Deadly, while also inspired by directors John Waters and Pedro Almod\u00f3var.However, underneath it all lies a girls\u2019 road trip movie which is empowering, enlightening, a little dangerous, and of course, a little fun.The Road MapThe girls' road trip movie (GRTM) is about women who just ~need to get away~ from the monotony of their everyday lives. Abandoning their at-home responsibilities for even a weekend, everything is about being present in the moment with each other, the car, and the road. They meet colorful characters within the Americana melting pot and rebel against the patriarchy through their renewed sense of freedom that comes with connecting to the nature of sisterhood. There might even be car singalongs, a get-rich-quick scheme, and a little bit of crime! (Your mileage may vary.)\u00a0Compared to other forms of travel, a girls\u2019 road trip movie is a pressure cooker. The car is an unsung and unofficial character and the almost always present race against some clock is the antagonist. Compared to planes, trains, and charter buses, a car is usually the most accessible and convenient (also the slowest) way to travel, especially if you\u2019re a teenager \u2013 as we see in many modern versions of this genre. If you have a license, a dream, and the will to drive for hours on end in a metal box while at the mercy of the elements, the world is yours! Trapped in a car together, you become the captain and the crewmembers, you spend every moment together, share lodging and secrets, and are essentially each other\u2019s lifelines out in the expanse of lands with spotty Wi-Fi and sketchy characters.Drive-Away Dolls is a lesbian spin on this genre, yet it drives down the same road as many previous girls\u2019 road trip players have \u2013 one that ultimately transforms its travelers. The boisterous Jamie (Qualley) is caught cheating and is kicked out of her shared apartment, so she joins the buttoned-up and touch-starved Marian (Viswanathan) on a trip down to Tallahassee. In the titular drive-away Dodge Aries, they head out with a destination, some unplanned detours, dildos, and multiple dalliances ahead of them.\u00a0There are a few different dynamics that can come into play in girls' road trip movies: adult best friends (Thelma & Louise, The Sweetest Thing, Joy Ride) or former childhood friends (Unpregnant, Crossroads). Sometimes they\u2019re coworkers or acquaintances (Zola, Death Proof). And while the odd-couple pairing is not required, it\u2019s always more entertaining to have opposing personalities. Women are socialized at a young age to present and act in certain ways that serve the patriarchy and fit within a structure that keeps women in restrictive roles but are at odds with the carefree and curious childlike ways we first experience the world and each other. Remove the constraints of society and we revert to our natures to commune with each other. Consider it the inverse of Lord of the Flies. Women thrive outside of the restrictions of a society constructed by and for men. Take men out of the society that was built for them and they devolve into chaos.\u00a0Unpregnant (HBO Max)Not-So-United StatesMost GRTMs, however, tend to exaggerate the \u201cothering\u201d feeling of visiting a new place with fundamentally different perspectives or customs. It\u2019s a shorthand for how far they\u2019ve traveled, and as always, it\u2019s never a road trip movie without meeting some colorful characters! Sexy strangers, pervy truck drivers, unfazed diner waitresses, unaccommodating motel clerks, and wary gas station attendants all tinge our travelers\u2019 journey with some interesting color. Ideologically different humans show how the United States is not so united in some of its views, forcing women to contextualize their existence in different parts of the country. Unpregnant had fundamental Christians trying to sabotage the girls' trip to the abortion appointment, while a libertarian prepper suited up and drove them there! Balance?So yes, solo road trips are a thing, but sociologically it\u2019s always better and safer when girls go at it together, like going to the restroom! Move in packs. I\u2019m very serious in claiming Mad Max: Fury Road as a GRTM for the example of the dangers to women on the road, effectively leaving them exposed to their natural predators \u2013 men.\u00a0What\u2019s a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?Often, our heroines end up running away from society and its constructs, roles, and expectations, whichever form that may take. In Thelma & Louise, Thelma\u2019s first act of rebellion is forsaking her shitty husband and running off to a fun girls\u2019 weekend. And while she has a flirty dance with a bar hound, it\u2019s the pervasive rape culture and the realization that the court of public opinion will never take their side that drives Thelma and Louise off a cliff. In Death Proof, Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) gets his kicks off stalking women, taunting them, and running them off the road. He insinuates violence unless he gets the lap dance Julia (Sydney Poitier) promised Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito) would do. The women Stuntman Mike runs into a year later happen to also have stunt women who fight back with a muscle car of their own and kick the shit out of him at the end. In Zola, X (Colman Domingo) is a threatening pimp who uses Stefani (Riley Keough) in an attempt to trap Taylour Paige\u2019s title character into prostitution. Still, the two women form a tenuous partnership to make it through the all-night ordeal. The analogy of restricting and oppressive culture patriarchy is taken to its logical conclusion in Mad Max: Fury Road \u2013 women are seen as property and used as breeders and milk harvesters. So for these women, taking to the road is the way to go.Mad Max: Fury Road (Warner Bros. Pictures)The rapidly expanding collection of road trip movies has also lately become a vehicle (pun intended) for stories of strapped young women with unplanned pregnancies (Unpregnant, Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Grandma, Crossroads). Young women on the precipice of adulthood are making a huge personal decision that will change their young lives. In Unpregnant, Veronica (Haley Lu Richardson) is ostensibly trapped by her ignorant, self-serving boyfriend who wants to keep her from going off to college. Taryn Manning\u2019s Mimi in Crossroads is pursuing her pop singer dreams while pregnant and decides that she\u2019s giving her baby conceived from rape up for adoption.\u00a0On the flip side, however, the road trip encourages a type of sexual freedom; bless these horny tumbleweeds blowing through small towns. Thelma is so satisfied by peak Brad Pitt that she doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s robbing them. The women in Joy Ride engage in truly raunchy activities with a basketball team that benched a few of them. Back to Drive-Away Dolls, Jamie and Marian join a basement makeout party. Britney Spears\u2019 entire arc of losing her virginity in Crossroads is iconically captured by \u201cI\u2019m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\u201d! On the road, these women belong to no one but themselves and it\u2019s so freeing!Thelma & Louise (MGM)To quote Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey.\u201d Sometimes the destination is only the beginning of the real adventure, where hardships can arise and force these women to scramble. In that process, they learn more about themselves and the world around them while also deepening their friendships. Long live the girls\u2019 road trip movie: the great celebration of the resiliency of being a woman breaking free from a patriarchal society\u2026 and a reminder that we can always take a little break now and then to be present with ourselves and our surroundings.

All that's visible of them are their teenage faces, swathed in black hijabs. They were around 15 and 16 years old respectively when the young Tunisian women became involved with the Islamic State group (IS), which is categorised as a terrorist group by the British government (among others). Their fate, the documentary director Kaouther Ben Hania tells the viewer, was \"to be devoured by the wolf\"\u00a0\u2013 a reference to the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood.\nMore like this:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Oscar nominee wading into the US culture wars-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Ukraine documentary up for an Oscar-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why Anatomy of a Fall's argument went viral\nFour Daughters has garnered Tunisian filmmaker Ben Hania her second Oscar nomination, this time in the documentary category (her first was in the international film category in 2021 for the drama The Man Who Sold His Skin, about a Syrian refugee who sells himself for art in return for a Schengen visa). In Four Daughters, the story of Ghofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui, their younger sisters Eya and Tayssir and their mother Olfa, is told through remembering the events that led to the older sisters joining IS. It reveals a fascinating and disturbing history of generational female trauma, intertwined with the history of Tunisia itself.To begin with, Ben Hania says, she was interested by what might motivate a young woman to join group like IS. \"We're used to men doing this and it's quite new that women are also involved with terrorism. I think I wanted to understand why young women are attracted to this,\" she tells BBC Culture. \"One of the ideas that I found very counterintuitive is that Ghofrane and Rahma were looking for freedom. They wanted to break free from the oppression of their mother. They wanted to prove to their mother and to their father that they were worthy. So, it's mind-blowing for me to understand that a desire for freedom and for another horizon can lead you there.\"\nThere are many photos of young women like the Chikhaoui sisters, who ran away to join IS during the height of the group's acts of terror and occupation. A 2018 report from King's College London estimated that 4,761 female foreign citizens were linked to IS activities in Iraq and Syria between 2013 and 2018.You have the headlines, but what's behind the headlines? For this, you need time, and that's why you have cinema \u2013 Kaouther Ben HaniaLike Ben Hania, the media is also interested in the idea of the female terrorist\u00a0\u2013 and those who join such groups can be judged as harshly as their male peers. A London teenager, Shamima Begum, who joined IS as a 15-year-old, was recently stripped of her British citizenship, although her lawyers had appealed on the basis that she had been groomed by IS. \"You have the headlines,\" Ben Hania says. \"But what's behind the headlines? For this, you need time, and that's why you have cinema.\"\nWhat's memorable about Four Daughters is the way Ben Hania gets to the root of why the Chikhaoui sisters made these choices. As well as asking the girls' mother, Olfa Hamrouni, to participate, and the two younger daughters, the director asked two actresses, Ichrak Matar and Nour Karoui, to play the parts of Ghofrane and Rahma, and Tunisian-Egyptian star Hend Sabry to play Olfa when memories might become too distressing for her. One Tunisian actor, Majd Mastoura, plays all the male characters, a dramatic device adopted to let the female characters stand out.\u00a0\nA tragic cycle of abuse Ben Hania stresses the film isn't a docudrama or reminiscent of a documentary such as Joshua Oppenheimer's 2012 Oscar-nominated The Act of Killing, which asked former Indonesian death-squad leaders to re-enact their crimes. \"Despite the fact you have actors, the acting parts are very small in the film and the actors are acting as a person, they're sharing their thoughts and their questions with Olfa and her two daughters. Maybe we can call it a meta documentary because it's a movie about a movie being done about actors and real characters,\" she suggests.\n\"I started by shooting a fly-on-the-wall documentary, but I quickly realised that it wasn't interesting, I need more to dig deep into this story, so I borrowed tools from fiction, from cinema mainly, to go further and to tell this story in a better, deeper way. \"I brought actors to Olfa and to the two youngest daughters, the real characters, so they can direct the actors to remember their memories and what happened. It's a dialogue, you see, between actor and real character. It's the story of transmission, from mother to daughter, transmission of violence, and what the mother calls 'malediction'.\"Ben Hania asked the girls' mother Olfa Hamrouni to participate, with Tunisian-Egyptian star Hend Sabry taking her part at points (Credit: Twenty Twenty Vision)What's apparent from the film is that Olfa Hamrouni suffered abuse as a young woman, recalling that as a teenager she tried to protect her own mother and sisters from sexual violence, hitting out herself. When she married her daughters' father, she recalls her own sister urging the bridegroom to treat Olfa roughly to get the marriage consummation over and done with. But Olfa punched the groom and used that blood to stain the sheets that were supposed to signify that sex had taken place. Later Olfa, now bringing up her daughters alone, would become violent with her girls, out of fear that they would become what's referred to in the film as \"sluts\"; when Ghofrane dyed her hair and shaved her legs, Olfa recalls beating her. By the end of the film, Olfa tells Kaouther Ben Hania that she is like the cat, \"who out of fear for her babies, eats them. I was so afraid for them, I was unable to protect them. I didn't eat them, but I lost them\".\n\"Olfa refers to this generational cycle in the film as 'the curse',\" Ben Hania explains. \"So, what she went through as a child and teenager, she did exactly the same to her daughters. She understood during the movie what was happening with her and how this inheritance of trauma affected her daughters also. But what is great is that at one point the actors also tell her, 'We all do this. We transfer to our daughters what we inherit from our mothers, and then we finally arrive at the generation that says, stop. We don't want this anymore.' The eldest daughters had a very violent reaction and said no to this cycle, and maybe the two youngest will be saved. They're the hope in this film.\"I think what radicalisation at least offered them is they could reverse the power dynamic with their mother \u2013 Ben HaniaPerhaps what partly motivated Ghofrane and Rahma to first wear hijabs and then niqabs (which, according to the film, were rarely used in public before the 2011 Tunisian Revolution) was to seek safety from their mother, but as they became radicalised further, Ben Hania suggests it was a way of them asserting authority over her. \"I think what radicalisation at least offered them is they could reverse the power dynamic with their mother. They can lecture their mother, they can lecture the people lecturing them about their sexuality,\" she points out.\n\"I think that what is paradoxical in this story, is that the patriarchy is not all the men played by Majd Mastoura, but that someone like Olfa was the guardian of the patriarchy. She was the one putting pressure on her daughters. And since they were beautiful girls, they almost had to refute that they'd turn bad or become 'sluts', as it's said in the movie. When you have this perpetual accusation, because you are women, you have to find a way to defend yourself.\"Kaouther Ben Hania's Four Daughters won best documentary at the recent Spirit Awards and is up for an Oscar (Credit: Getty Images)Ben Hania agrees that Ghofrane and Rahma were also teenagers during a period that was ripe for them to be radicalised. After the instability of the Tunisian Revolution in 2011 and the rise of the Islamic State group, many Tunisians became attracted by the idea of joining the group in Libya, Iraq or Syria. Up to 6,000 Tunisians were estimated to have joined IS by 2015. \"I think about that quote from Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci, that 'the old world is dying, the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters,'\" she says.\n\"He was talking about Europe between two worlds, but it could be said too about the Arab Spring and the rise of Islamic State. In the twilight, you have monsters. The Revolution, the Arab Spring, shook the dictatorships in the region, but also the new world, the fruit of this revolution, freedom and democracy, they weren't there yet. So, you have all these monsters playing while the new world is late to arrive. Olfa's daughters were in this place with monsters.\"\nGhofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui's names made headlines in Tunisia in 2015 when it emerged that they had joined IS; Olfa would also appear on Tunisian television saying that she'd warned the authorities that that her daughters were being radicalised (she had even requested that they'd lock Rahma up, to prevent her from running away.) They would later be captured in Libya, and in 2023 were sentenced to 16 years in prison. Ghofrane's eight-year-old daughter Fatma is growing up in a Libyan prison with her mother.\nBen Hania reports that her film is still playing in cinemas in Tunisia, nearly six months after its release. However, plans to either allow the sisters to come and stand trial in Tunisia, or to allow Fatma to leave prison, have so far not been successful. Perhaps most moving in Four Daughters, which sums up the history of family trauma revealed by the documentary, is when Eya Chikhaoui is asked what she'd say to her sisters if she could see them again.\n\"This family that has destroyed you, I won't let it destroy me,\" she says.\nFour Daughters is on release now; the Academy Awards take place on 10 March 2024.\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.;", "length": 10453, "publishedTime": "2024-03-04T11:00:00Z", "rating": [8, 9, 8, 7, 8, 8, 7], "reason": "The article provides accurate information about the documentary \"Four Daughters\" and the story of Ghofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui.

One by one, other countries seen as immune to extremism saw far-right parties enter parliament: The Alternative for Germany party won its first parliamentary seats in 2017; two years later, Spain\u2019s Vox party followed suit. Those parties joined well-established ones in Austria, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and elsewhere, quickly cementing their place in their countries\u2019 political landscapes.\nIn Portugal, however, a smattering of small far-right parties had tried but failed to win serious influence over the five decades since the 1974 revolution that toppled the country\u2019s dictatorship. When Chega, a far-right party led by the charismatic Andr\u00e9 Ventura, came onto the scene in 2019, it looked likely to face the same headwinds as its predecessors.\nBut the campaign dynamics ahead of the March 10 snap legislative election are proof that the political scene is changing in this country of 10 million. According to recent polling, Chega (\u201cEnough\u201d) could take almost 20 percent of the vote. With the center-left Socialists and center-right Social Democrats running neck and neck for first place, Chega may well end up being the kingmaker for the next government if, as expected, neither mainstream party gains enough seats to form a majority. The results will serve as the latest data point in the far right\u2019s ascent across the continent ahead of European Parliament elections in June.\nVentura, a 41-year-old former TV soccer commentator running on the message of \u201cPortugal needs a clean-up,\u201d has been spurred on by a perfect storm of factors, including the corruption-related resignation of Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa late last year, rising frustration with the political system, and a rightward shift among young voters. A wide-ranging corruption probe into members of Costa\u2019s Socialist government triggered this month\u2019s vote and propelled newfound support for Chega.\nAs a result, when it comes to the far right, Portugal is no longer the outlier. In fact, it was never really immune to far-right politics, experts say\u2014it just hadn\u2019t had the right moment or the right leader to capitalize on them.\nThat said, since the 1974 revolution, a confluence of historical factors has helped limit the far right\u2019s ability to gain traction in Portugal. One of these was the nature of the revolution itself, which was a reaction to a conservative dictatorship. Led in large part by left-leaning movements, the revolution prevented \u201canything to the right of the mainstream right from emerging for a very long time,\u201d said Luca Manucci, a political science researcher at the University of Lisbon. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that these parties didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nPortugal\u2019s long history of immigration from its former colonies, such as Brazil, Cape Verde, and Angola, also meant that immigration has been less divisive here than in many other European countries. \u201cImmigration is not politicized in Portugal almost at all,\u201d said Lea Heyne, who researches Portugal\u2019s far right alongside Manucci. \u201cThis has limited Chega to some degree in the way that they can act as other populist radical right parties act in other countries.\u201d\nFive years ago, Chega barely made a dent on the national level. In the 2019 elections, the newly founded party won just 1.3 percent of the vote and a single constituency in parliament: Ventura\u2019s, located just outside Lisbon. It may not have been a strong showing, but it was a historic first and gave Ventura a springboard to get into the political spotlight.\nVentura has all the right characteristics to draw in voters. As Ant\u00f3nio Costa Pinto, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon\u2019s Institute of Social Sciences, put it, \u201cVentura is the party.\u201d\nVentura came from the center-right Social Democratic Party (PSD), which gives him the veneer of respectability needed to win over a broader range of voters. He broke from PSD in 2018 after an unsuccessful 2017 mayoral campaign near Lisbon, during which he espoused harshly anti-Roma rhetoric, a message he has built on as a member of parliament. Ventura refers to Portugal\u2019s Roma population, which has been in the country for centuries, as \u201ccriminal,\u201d arguing they disproportionately rely on government benefits.\nVentura has also built up a persona based on his willingness to say things other politicians won\u2019t. \u201cHe introduced a new type of political speech, an anti-elitist political speech\u2014the typical populist radical right recipe,\u201d Pinto said. On top of that, Ventura\u2019s role as a professional soccer commentator made him well known across the country. \u201cThe moment he created Chega, all the cameras were pointed at him,\u201d Manucci said.\nIn the 2022 election, Chega drew increased attention on the national stage as it won 12 seats and 7.2 percent of the vote. Since then, Ventura has been able to tap into a swath of voters dissatisfied with the Portuguese political system, including young people and many who had previously not voted.\nA more recent wave of migration\u2014the number of people of foreign origin living in Portugal rose for the seventh consecutive year in 2022\u2014has also allowed Ventura and Chega to begin instrumentalizing an issue that long played a minor role in Portuguese politics. Ventura has advocated harsher penalties for illegal immigration, saying it \u201cdestroys Europe,\u201d and called for \u201cthe drastic reduction of the Islamic presence in the European Union.\u201d\nChega has also pledged to \u201cput an end to corruption\u201d among Portugal\u2019s political elite\u2014a slogan found on its campaign posters plastered around Lisbon. This message resonates with voters in an election where corruption plays a central role. Costa, the prime minister, resigned last November after police arrested his chief of staff and raided his residence and government buildings in relation to alleged influence-peddling surrounding Portugal\u2019s lithium mining industry. (Costa himself has not been accused of wrongdoing.) Another former Socialist prime minister, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, will stand trial for a separate corruption scandal.\n\u201cWhen a party tells everybody that the elites are corrupt, and then the elites are corrupt, this can only play into the hands of the far right,\u201d Manucci said.\nVentura clearly sees himself as part of an international far-right movement. After Javier Milei won Argentina\u2019s presidential election in November 2023, Ventura posted on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cThe fight to defend society is taking place in several territories and in Argentina the first battle has been won!\u201d Recently, he told the Financial Times that he considers Italian far-right leader Matteo Salvini \u201ca very good friend\u201d and that he has \u201ca great relation\u201d with Dutch politician Geert Wilders, whose far-right Party for Freedom came in first in the Netherlands\u2019 November parliamentary elections. \u201cI believe we are united,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cWe are strong.\u201d\nPortugal is part of \u201cthe unfortunate pattern of the far right growing everywhere,\u201d said Daphne Halikiopoulou, a comparative politics professor at the University of York who focuses on far-right parties. With European Parliament elections on the horizon, major gains for the country\u2019s far right\u2014combined with growing momentum for similar parties across the continent\u2014will be seen as a bellwether for political trends across the continent, spurred on by anti-immigrant sentiment, anti-establishment populism, and cost of living crises.\nNot only are these parties growing in many countries, Halikiopoulou said, but they are also becoming increasingly normalized. In Europe, the far right is in power in Hungary and Italy; it has joined governing coalitions in Finland and previously in Austria; and it has informally supported governments across the continent, such as in Sweden, where the far-right Sweden Democrats are not officially part of the governing coalition with the center-right Moderate Party but support its legislation.\nThat normalization gives people who are sympathetic to far-right policies moral and political cover to vote for them. \u201cA lot of people who had certain attitudes and didn\u2019t want to be stigmatized\u2014now they\u2019re free,\u201d Halikiopoulou said.", "length": 8656, "publishedTime": "2024-03-07T13:54:48-05:00", "rating": [6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 7], "reason": [{"Accuracy": "The article provides a detailed and accurate account of the rise of far-right politics in Portugal, citing specific examples and historical context to support its claims."}, {"Objectivity": "The article presents a balanced perspective, discussing both the factors contributing to the rise of the far right and the historical limitations that have influenced Portuguese politics.

Pittsburgh", "excerpt": "A new cellphone app that uses AI to accurately diagnose ear infections could be more accurate that trained clinicians.", "textContent": "A new smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to accurately diagnose ear infections, or acute otitis media, could help decrease unnecessary antibiotic use in young children, according to new research.\nAcute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood infections for which antibiotics are prescribed but can be difficult to discern from other ear conditions without intensive training.\nThe new AI tool, which makes a diagnosis by assessing a short video of the ear drum captured by an otoscope connected to a cellphone camera, offers a simple and effective solution that could be more accurate than trained clinicians.\n\u201cAcute otitis media is often incorrectly diagnosed,\u201d says senior author Alejandro Hoberman, professor of pediatrics and director of the division of general academic pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and senior author of the study in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\u201cUnderdiagnosis results in inadequate care and overdiagnosis results in unnecessary antibiotic treatment, which can compromise the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics. Our tool helps get the correct diagnosis and guide the right treatment.\u201d\nAbout 70% of children have an ear infection before their first birthday, Hoberman says. Although this condition is common, accurate diagnosis of AOM requires a trained eye to detect subtle visual findings gained from a brief view of the ear drum on a wriggly baby.\nAOM is often confused with otitis media with effusion, or fluid behind the ear, a condition that generally does not involve bacteria and does not benefit from antimicrobial treatment.\nTo develop a practical tool to improve accuracy in the diagnosis of AOM, Hoberman and his team started by building and annotating a training library of 1,151 videos of the tympanic membrane from 635 children who visited outpatient UPMC pediatric offices between 2018 and 2023. Two trained experts with extensive experience in AOM research reviewed the videos and made a diagnosis of AOM or not AOM.\n\u201cThe ear drum, or tympanic membrane, is a thin, flat piece of tissue that stretches across the ear canal,\u201d says Hoberman. \u201cIn AOM, the ear drum bulges like a bagel, leaving a central area of depression that resembles a bagel hole. In contrast, in children with otitis media with effusion, no bulging of the tympanic membrane is present.\u201d\nThe researchers used 921 videos from the training library to teach two different AI models to detect AOM by looking at features of the tympanic membrane, including shape, position, color, and translucency. Then they used the remaining 230 videos to test how the models performed.\nBoth models were highly accurate, producing sensitivity and specificity values of greater than 93%, meaning that they had low rates of false negatives and false positives.\nAccording to Hoberman, previous studies of clinicians have reported diagnostic accuracy of AOM ranging from 30% to 84%, depending on type of health care provider, level of training, and age of the children being examined.\n\u201cThese findings suggest that our tool is more accurate than many clinicians,\u201d says Hoberman. \u201cIt could be a gamechanger in primary health care settings to support clinicians in stringently diagnosing AOM and guiding treatment decisions.\u201d\n\u201cAnother benefit of our tool is that the videos we capture can be stored in a patient\u2019s medical record and shared with other providers,\u201d says Hoberman. \u201cWe can also show parents and trainees\u2014medical students and residents\u2014what we see and explain why we are or are not making a diagnosis of ear infection. It is important as a teaching tool and for reassuring parents that their child is receiving appropriate treatment.\u201d\nHoberman hopes that the technology could soon be implemented widely across health care provider offices to enhance accurate diagnosis of AOM and support treatment decisions.\nAdditional coauthors are from the University of Pittsburgh, New York University, Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, and Dcipher Analytics.\nThe pediatrics department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine supported the work.", "length": 4212, "publishedTime": "2024-03-05T14:37:19+00:00", "rating": [8, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 7], "reason": "The article provides a detailed explanation of a new smartphone app that is claimed to accurately diagnose ear infections in children better than trained clinicians.

If you\u2019re looking for the best whitening or kids toothpaste, we rounded up ADA-accepted options separately.

Additionally, toothpastes with the ADA Seal of Acceptance do not contain flavoring agents like sugar that cause or contribute to tooth decay.Aside from picking a toothpaste with the ADA Seal of Acceptance, choosing one is mostly a matter of personal preference, said Reboucas. As long as you do not select a fluoride-free option, anything you enjoy using is the right choice for you.Brushing your teeth with toothpaste is only one element of an oral care routine, according to Hewlett. In order to effectively remove plaque and prevent tooth decay, gingivitis, gum disease and bad breath, you should also visit your dentist regularly, as well as use mouthwash and floss daily (or use a water flosser).Toothpaste for specialized needsSome adults\u2019 teeth have additional needs that specialized toothpaste options can address. Reboucas said specialized toothpastes contain specific active ingredients to help with issues like sensitivity and tartar build-up. Some whitening options are made with hydrogen peroxide, the same ingredient that is often found in other teeth whitening products, in order to remove surface stains from teeth. Anti-erosion toothpastes usually contain ingredients to restore the minerals in tooth enamel \u2014 like sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride \u2014 and harden them over time.Experts told us it\u2019s important to speak with your dentist about your unique oral hygiene needs to decide if you should purchase specialized toothpaste. \u201cYour dentist knows your oral health status better than anybody and is an advocate for your oral health, so consult with them and see what toothpaste they recommend for you,\u201d Hewlett said.What about charcoal toothpaste, \u201cnatural\u201d toothpaste and solid toothpaste?Dentists often field questions from patients about \u201ctrends\u201d in the toothpaste space and whether these products are effective. We asked experts to share a few of the most common toothpaste trends they\u2019re asked about and what we should know about them.Charcoal toothpasteCharcoal is often thought of as an ingredient that can absorb toxins and bacteria on your teeth or in your mouth \u2014 similar to how it purifies water. However, experts agree that you should not use it. There are no charcoal toothpastes with the ADA Seal of Acceptance, and a study published in The Journal of The American Dental Association found that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to support efficacy claims. Experts also said that using charcoal toothpaste may damage the outer layer of enamel since charcoal is abrasive.\"Natural\" toothpaste\u201cCurrently, the FDA does not define the term \u2018natural toothpaste,\u2019 which leaves consumers to define what natural means to them,\" said Dr. Kate Zoumboukos of SW Austin Dental. She said it\u2019s common for the term \u201cnatural toothpaste\u201d to describe options that are free of artificial flavors and ingredients, preservatives, sweeteners and dyes. Experts agree that any toothpaste marketed as \"natural\" is effective so long as it has the ADA Seal of Acceptance.Solid toothpasteToothpaste most often comes in a gel or paste form, but some brands sell solid toothpaste, usually in the form of a tablet you chew into a gum-like substance before brushing your teeth with it. There are no solid toothpaste options that have the ADA Seal of Acceptance, and thus they do not meet our experts\u2019 guidance.Meet our expertsAt Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

New research suggests that at least one species of caecilian also produces \"milk\" for its hatchlings.\n Caecilians are amphibians that look superficially like very large earthworms. New research suggests that at least one species of caecilian also produces \"milk\" for its hatchlings.\n A species of worm-like amphibian has been caught on camera feeding milk to its young. The creature, known as a caecilian, lives underground. Researchers believe that the animal developed the ability to produce a milk-like substance independently of mammals, who are universally known for feeding milk to their young. Caecilians are descended from the same lineage as frogs and salamanders. Hundreds of millions of years ago, their ancestors burrowed deep into the ground. They lost their legs, their eyes mostly stopped working, and their bodies became long and segmented. A modern caecilian looks a little like a long shimmering earthworm with a head, which has led some to call them icky. \n That's a characterization Marta Antoniazzi totally rejects. \"I really don't agree that they are disgusting,\" says Marta Antoniazzi, a biologist at the Instituto Butantan, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Brazil is home to lots of caecilians and Antoniazzi is a fan. \n \"They are kind of elegant, and they have a shiny body and a very nice face,\" she says. But wait, there's more. The particular caecilian species that Antoniazzi and her colleagues study is called Siphonops annulatus. Mothers of this species give birth to broods of wriggly babies who then proceed to eat their own mother's skin off. \"Once a week, they can eat her skin,\" says Pedro Luiz Mailho-Fontana, a researcher at the Insituto Butantan who was involved in the study. This doesn't seem to bother mama, and the babies get lots of nutrition from the skin. Carlos Jared directs the institute's department of structural biology and leads the team that was studying the caecilians. As he was watching this fascinating process, he couldn't help but notice the wriggly little babies had a ton of energy. \"They are so, so active, it's impossible to eat only once or twice per week,\" he says. So the team stuck a camera in the nest and started watching. And pretty soon, they noticed the babies were gathering around one particular spot. \n \"The babies prefer to go to the tail of the mother,\" he says. And that's when they saw it. A secretion coming from the tail: \"A kind of substance, like milk.\" Upon further study, the team found that the milk contained lipids and sugars similar to mammalian milk. It was essentially providing the same function. \"It's a very unusual form of nutrition\" for an egg-laying animal, says Mailho-Fontana. The team published their results in this week's issue of the Journal Science. \n Marvalee Wake, a professor of integrative biology at the University of California at Berkeley, who was not involved with the study, says that this species of caecilian has evolved to deal with a similar problem faced by human babies. Just like humans, the little ones are born long before they can fend for themselves. They're vulnerable. And in order to help them grow, while keeping them close, their mother has developed a milk-ish fluid. \"This is convergent evolution,\" she says. Convergent evolution is the process by which very different species can evolve similar traits. But is it really milk? The Brazilian team doesn't say whether the milk meets FDA standards, but it does contain lipids and sugars. Wake says she thinks it counts. \"If it has all these basic subunits, it's convergent evolution on a nutritive material, and that's what it's all about,\" she says. For Antoniazzi, caecilians are a wonderful reminder that very different animals, like puppies and underground worm-amphibians, can share a lot in common. \"Nature is very creative,\" she says. \"Sometimes it gives the same solution to different groups of animals.\"", "length": 4567, "publishedTime": "2024-03-07T14:01:11-05:00", "rating": [8, 7, 9, 8, 8, 9, 7], "reason": "The article is highly accurate, presenting scientific findings about a caecilian species producing milk for its young, supported by research published in a reputable journal.

The Aggies failed to win a quarter, largely due to their continued shooting woes. Molly Kaiser poured in 17 points, but the team mustered up just 51. The home squad missed 22 field goals in the second half as part of a 36.4% showing from the field. The Aggies have now shot below 40% from the floor 10 times in 15 conference games, and have eclipsed 45% in just 3 of their last 18 contests.\nSimply put, the scenarios are nearly endless for NM State's final CUSA seed. With a loss, the Aggies would fall to 5-11, securing the No. 8 seed, having to play an extra game versus Sam Houston on Tuesday, March 12. With a win, NM State could potentially move as high as the No. 6 seed. WKU falling to Liberty would greatly aid the Aggies, likely setting up a three-way tie alongside the Hilltoppers and Miners at 6-10. With that outcome, NM State would hold the best record in the round robin between the three, clinching the top seed among the group (No. 6).\u00a0\nThe opening moments of games can often foreshadow the result in Aggie games this season. NM State is now 11-2 when on top after 10 minutes, 11-6 when ahead at halftime, and 11-3 with an advantage to start the final frame. For the entire season, the Aggies possess only six losses when leading at any point after the first quarter.\u00a0\nOn the flip side, Jody Adams' bunch has yet to come back from a single deficit at any quarter break this season. When trailing or tied, the Aggies are now 0-15 after the opening frame, 0-11 at halftime and 0-14 when down or even at the start of the fourth quarter.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe Conference USA schedule has included 68 games through March 7, 2024. Road teams now have a 25-43 record in those games. The conference's top two seeds (Middle Tennessee and FIU) are a combined 13-3 away from home, with one loss being FIU at Middle Tennessee. The league's other seven teams have combined for just 12 road wins in 52 tries. Sam Houston, the league's last-place team, is 2-6 in CUSA home games as part of a 7-20 overall record.\u00a0\nExcluding home games against MTSU, FIU and road games with Sam Houston, CUSA is collectively 6-38 in 44 contests away from home. NM State has one of those six wins; a 50-44 defensive shutdown of Western Kentucky on Jan. 18. In games outside the Pan American Center, NM State is 4-11, with a 2-10 road record and wins in two of three neutral games.\u00a0\nThere have been two Aggies to start all 28 games this season. Every opening tip has been taken by Ene Adams, who has put forth a career year. The senior is sinking 52.2 percent of her shots en route to averaging 7.8 points per game in just 22.5 average minutes of action. Adams also paces the Aggies with 148 total rebounds, 58 of which have come on the offensive end. Molly Kaiser has been the other senior in every starting five of 2023-24. The fourth-year Aggie has improved in nearly every offensive statistic from a year prior. Kaiser has twice as many 3-pointers this season (24) than last (12), and has drastically improved her 3-point percentage to 36.5 percent (+10.9). Additionally, the Watauga, Texas native has canned 87.3 percent of her free-throw attempts to bolster her career-high 14.5 points per game.\u00a0\nWith 1:12 remaining in the third quarter at Middle Tennessee on Jan. 20, Watauga, Texas native Molly Kaiser employed one of her patented moves \u2013 driving down the left side of the lane before pulling up for an elbow jumper \u2013 burying the shot to give her six points in the quarter. The play held extra significance as it gave Kaiser 1,000 career points, with every bucket coming as a member of the Crimson & White.\nKaiser became the 25th\u00a0member of the 1,000-point club, and the first since Gia Pack, who played for the Aggies from 2016-2020.\nTransferring in from Butler CC in El Dorado, Kansas, junior guard Jaila Harding has been a spark on offense for the Crimson & White, especially from the 3-point line. Last season, the Aggies ranked 328th\u00a0in the nation from beyond the arc, shooting just 26.1 percent. Through 28 games in the 2023-24 season, this has jumped to 31.6 percent, while ranking 145th\u00a0in the nation.\nAmong members with at least 2.0 made deep balls per game, Harding paces the Aggies and is second in CUSA with a 36.9 3-point percentage. The Wichita, Kan. native ranks 78th\u00a0individually by 3-point percentage and is fourth in the conference with 2.07 made threes per contest.\nFIU is led by fourth-year Head Coach\u00a0Jesyka Burks-Wiley, who touts a 64-57 record in her time with the program. Mya Kone is the team's leading scorer, pouring in 11.4 points and 8.0 rebounds per night. Courtney Prenger is the only Panther to start 28 games this season, ranking third in points per game (9.0), adding 103 rebounds and 28 assists on the campaign. The Panthers were led by Tanajah Hayes in Las Cruces, who contributed 18 points, three assists and a pair of 3-pointers. Hayes is averaging 10.5 points per game this season, but has improved that number to 14.5 across her past eight games.\nMaria Torres added 16 points (8-for-11 field goals), 6 rebounds and three steals in FIU's win at NM State. The Spanish forward went down with a leg injury on Feb. 15 versus Sam Houston and has not played since. The Panthers, however, have found ways to win despite Torres' absence. In FIU's game on Thursday, the home team soundly defeated UTEP 88-62. The Miners took a 9-0 lead early, but FIU dropped the hammer, scoring 50 points in the next 16 minutes and 11 seconds. 32 second-quarter points put them ahead 50-27 at the break, and the Panthers never looked back.\u00a0\nFor complete coverage of NM State Women's Basketball, follow us on Twitter (@NMStateWBB), Instagram (@NMStateWBB) and like us on Facebook (NM State Women's Basketball).

Such a closure is unusual in Europe where weekly print publications for children have seen a renaissance in recent years.", "textContent": "The editorial director of Journal des Enfants (JDE) had signalled the possible move months ago by saying that she had been told her weekly for children could not commit to any new joint actions with similar news outlets.\u201cAt a time when mistrust is plaguing the relationship between the French and the media, a brick from the base of this edifice is removed, further destabilising the structure,\u201d read a staff statement released on Linkedin. \u201cWho will the children of tomorrow trust to keep them informed? \u201d\u00a0JDE has 9,000 subscribers in France and around the world. It was founded in 1984 by B\u00e9atrice d\u2019Irube with the help of the regional newspaper l\u2019Alsace, owned by the Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel bank. The Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel bank now owns the EBRA press group, which includes both.It was ground-breaking: France\u2019s first newspaper to take children seriously as news consumers of real journalism. It won two WAN-IFRA World Young Reader Prizes for its work to explain press freedom to the young (2009) and its campaign to promote the importance of planting and nurturing trees (2016), plus a joint award for all France coverage of the 2015 Charlie Hebdo killings. Belgium\u2019s Vers L\u2019avenir used it as a model to start its own Journal des Enfants in 1992. Last year it created a partly free portal to support teachers with resources, lesson plans and teleconferences, especially about media literacy.Journal des Enfants offers a balanced news diet that includes a page of happy stories as well as explanations of world issuesEBRA spokeswoman Stella De Vivo said JDE needed to close \u201cdespite its high editorial quality.\u201d\u201cThe reasons for this difficult decision are twofold,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cThere has been a very strong and long deterioration in the market for children\u2019s publications. This is linked to significant competition both within the general press market and for youth magazines themselves.\u201cJDE has also not been immune to the general difficulties encountered in the sector, notably substantial increases in paper and energy prices.\u201dSuch a closure is unusual in Europe where weekly print publications for children have seen a renaissance in recent years. But none of those outlets contend with a level of competition for the roughly 9- to 12-year-old core audience that JDE has faced in France.\u00a0While challenges have come from the diverse portfolio of the formidable Bayard Jeunesse and from some smaller entities, its main competitor has been PlayBac Press.\u00a0After creating a first home-delivered daily for children in 1995, Mon Quotidien for ages 10 to 13, PlayBac followed soon with editions for age groups slightly younger (7-10) and older (over 13). Founding editor Fran\u00e7ois Dufour has long tried to nudge his audience toward online, but they still will have none of it and want print. The combined paid circulation in early 2023 for the two editions covering JDE\u2019s range of 7- to 13-year-olds was about 50,000, down from pre-pandemic days like all the French press, but still a large chunk of the market.\u00a0PlayBac has at least a slight cushion with additional revenue streams, notably a separate Special Editions department that does paid-for educational content for children and a robust educational games division.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s always sad to watch a newspaper for kids die,\u201d said Jer\u00f4me Saltet, another founder of PlayBac \u201cIn this case, I don\u2019t know why JDE is stopping. Anyway, it\u2019s bad news. Our daily newspapers for kids are not exactly in the same market due to our strong belief: \u201cIt\u2019s easier to ask a kid to read 10 minutes a day than 1 hour a week.\u201dWhether daily or weekly, the approach to that audience requires a lot of never-ending work, says Corinne Vorms of Bayard Jeunesse:\u201cYou have to bear in mind that every year, a children\u2019s magazine loses 1/3 of its readers because, quite simply, they\u2019ve grown up,\u201d she explains. \u201cSo you must therefore attract a new third of your readership to maintain and develop circulation. Meeting this challenge is a major marketing and communications challenge.\u201dBoosting print profits while promoting the goodPublishers in some other European countries have found doing journalism for children in a weekly print format can add to the parent company\u2019s bottom line.\u00a0\u00a0This is at least in part because of the particular journalistic DNA shared by modern news products for children regardless of platform that JDE minted 40 years ago: treating real news, especially news children cannot avoid, with succinct but carefully crafted journalism and context, an emphasis on solutions and media literacy.These editors also give extensive attention to audience members\u2019 mental health with a story mix that doesn\u2019t depress and even regular psychological advice.\u00a0One recent example of this was coverage of the start of the latest Middle East crisis that allowed these outlets to shine, partly because of their restraint.\u201cWe don\u2019t aim to inform them about every tragedy in the world,\u201d explains Simon Thinggaard Hjortkj\u00e6r, editor of Denmark\u2019s B\u00f8rneavisen. But we certainly want to help them understand if they have already heard about this in mainstream news sources, on social media or elsewhere.\u00a0The children\u2019s news market is so important in Germany that it gets a designated editor at the national Deutsche Press-Agentur wire service to serve the mainly regional news companies whose editors are also able to support a pay-to-join national interest group.\u00a0Building healthy news habitsLately, a key selling-point advantage for print versus digital approaches is that print gets children off screens for a while. (However, digital news for children is getting serious traction in the online space swamp, a topic we\u2019ll\u00a0 treat in a follow-up story.)Leading publishers in Austria, Denmark, Norway and Finland deem their print weeklies worth the work.\u00a0Kleine Zeitung counts on its children\u2019s editions as both an investment in its future and as profit centres now. Kleine Kinderzeitung began in 2004 as a subscription weekly and now also offers some free online content.It was followed in 2017 with the larger, wide-ranging Pausenzeitung. That publication serves teachers each month during the school year and made that educational emphasis clear from the start with the cover story about media literacy in its first edition titled \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything!\u201d\u00a0Walter Hauser, head of reader/user market at Kleine Zeitung, credits a multi-pronged approach for the success.\u00a0\u201cWe have a flourishing subscription business for Kleine Kinderzeitung, and with Kleine Pausenzeitung we are publishing a subscription product for schools,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe licensed both products to other publishers, and we developed innovative products for the ad markets.\u201d\u00a0 Those products include supplements with branded educational material.Norway\u2019s Aftenposten Junior, founded in 2012, reached profitability in six months and now has a circulation of about 30,000. In 2020, it began a digital school edition (Junior skole) and has launched a science-focused spin-off magazine.\u00a0Like Hauser, Audun Solberg, editor-in-chief of the parent Aftenposten (Schibsted News Media), also first emphasises the mission of \u201ccontributing to children acquiring new knowledge and information about the society around them, through journalism that meets Aftenposten\u2019s demands for quality and ethical standards.\u201dAftenposten Junior will continue to be profitable, she says, thanks to individual subscribers and collaborating with teachers and schools to provide\u201cup-to-date information that can be integrated into the curriculum.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0However, all has not been profitable for Schibsted in this sector. It licensed the concept to Postimees Juunior in Estonia starting in 2019. That supplement was gone within three years amid tepid reader response.\u00a0Alternatives to digitalFinland\u2019s Lasten Uutiset has done research to confirm why a weekly print product for children works there.\u00a0\u201cBasically we exist as a print entity since it seems to be what the kids and parents want,\u201d says Fanny Fr\u00f6man, who directs youth initiatives for the parent company, Helsingin Sanomat. \u201cOur reader surveys show that kids like the print format, and parents are eager to buy kids something that is not digital.\u201dFounded in 2016, Lasten Uutiset was first a free weekly news broadcast also available on YouTube and now seen regularly in most of Finland\u2019s primary schools. The company added a home-delivered, subscription print weekly of the same name in 2020.\u00a0The print weekly for children was profitable within months of its founding and now has 18,000 subscribers, Fr\u00f6man says.\u00a0A least one publisher outside Europe is investing more in its print edition for children, partly to attract \u201creluctant readers.\u201d\u00a0Straits Times (Singapore) began The Little Red Dot weekly in 2005. It has regularly won international awards since then, serving as a model for excellent practice.\u201cThe team behind it had noticed that our children reading it had of course evolved as a generation,\u201d explains Straits Times editor Jaime Ho. \u201cTheir needs and tastes had changed, and there was a need to sharpen the way the title catered to them. This was both in aesthetics and content.\u201dThe company did a makeover also designed to attract \u201creluctant readers\u201d by increasing visuals, doing stories at appropriate reading levels and including subject topics that \u201ctickle their interest more,\u201d he says. \u201cWe hope to make reading far more fun and natural for them.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Coming soon: how digital news providers are providing an oasis for children in the swamp of the online worldThe author, Aralynn McMane, Ph.D., is executive director of Global Youth & News Media, which has just established a Children\u2019s News Europe interest group.

He consulted powerful state Republicans. He reached out to national Republicans, including the most influential conservative redistricting lawyer in the country, to discuss funding a lawsuit and get strategic advice. He conferred with a Seattle law firm. And he found a Latino congressional hopeful to act as the face of the lawsuit.\nA countersuit was filed \u2014 against Graves\u2019 own work. This suit made the opposite argument from the Latino group\u2019s. Yes, the map that Graves and his fellow commissioners had created discriminated. But it had disadvantaged white people and other voters.\nSure enough, as Graves had foreseen, in August of last year the judge sided with the Latino plaintiffs. He determined the Yakima Valley map violated the Voting Rights Act, the landmark 1965 civil rights law that has been the bedrock of voting discrimination cases for over half a century. Section 2 of the VRA prohibits the creation of election districts that deprive voters of color of their full rights. The judge said the maps needed to be redrawn.\nHaving handed Latinos a win, the judge tossed the lawsuit that Graves had helped generate as moot. Undeterred, the legal team of Benancio Garcia, the Latino congressional hopeful, appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to block the new maps until it had weighed the merits of his claim. The court declined to take the case earlier this month, and it is unclear whether lawyers will now appeal to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nGraves told ProPublica he wanted legal action that would slow down the court because he believed the plaintiffs were about to push through \u201ca naked partisan gerrymander.\u201d\n\u201cMy singular goal, once a lawsuit was filed, was to defend the maps,\u201d he said in a statement. His work is described in sworn depositions and court documents, including emails and other communications introduced as exhibits.\nThe Washington state salvo is merely one part of a yearslong national legal assault on laws and policies intended to prevent discrimination. In 2013, in a victory for right-wing activists, the conservative-majority Supreme Court overturned a key aspect of the VRA, lifting federal oversight over maps in areas that had historically discriminated against people of color. Last year, plaintiffs succeeded in getting the high court to make affirmative action illegal at private universities. Conservatives have also targeted school desegregation efforts and diversity initiatives at myriad organizations, including corporations and universities.\nThe activists are not done. By taking aim at the remaining pillar of the VRA, Section 2, they could substantially reshape U.S. elections. Despite a recent setback at the Supreme Court in an Alabama case, a sprawling, multipronged effort to get the high court to change course continues, supported by key national Republican figures. The Washington state case is one of 38 in 12 states that seek to roll back protections against discrimination by either attacking Section 2 directly or arguing that the constitutional protections of the 14th Amendment, which was passed after the Civil War and extended full citizenship rights to all Americans, trump Section 2.\nThe underlying premise animating these legal efforts is, in the famous words of Chief Justice John Roberts in another major ruling, that \u201cthe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d The argument, which conservatives have been developing for years, flips what has been traditionally seen as the original intent of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. Instead, they argue, the amendment can be read as prohibiting taking racial and ethnic composition into account \u2014 period. Section 2, however, requires states to ensure that voters of color are fairly represented.\nRepublicans say that these competing mandates confuse state legislators as they try to draw fair maps. Democrats are taking advantage of Section 2 to draw as many districts as possible that will elect Democrats, according to Adam Kincaid, who directs the National Republican Redistricting Trust and its nonprofit affiliate the Fair Lines America Foundation. \u201cThat was not what Congress intended and is not what the Constitution permits,\u201d he said.\nVictory over Section 2 could stifle the voting power of nonwhite groups nationwide, striking fear in legal experts and activists who say that the country remains scarred by centuries of discrimination and racism.\n\u201cEven after serious damage by the Supreme Court, the Voting Rights Act remains one of the country\u2019s most effective civil rights statutes. Every attempt to limit its impact is really an attempt to limit our ability to protect against racial discrimination,\u201d said Justin Levitt, a former Justice Department civil rights official who is now a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School.\nTracking the course of mapmaking fights is vital to understanding the likely results of the 2024 elections. In Washington state, where partisan gerrymandering is forbidden, Graves and his fellow Republican commissioner came to believe the Democratic members were pushing a map that was overly favorable for their party.\nAt issue was how to divide Yakima Valley, a rural area that\u2019s home to many of the state\u2019s vineyards and historically has voted Republican. In recent years, the Latino population in the valley has boomed.\nBy the Democrats\u2019 read of Section 2, the commission was required to create a district that gave Latinos in Yakima a fair chance to elect the candidate of their choice. The commission couldn\u2019t reach a consensus on whether it should hire a consultant to do a racial voting analysis, so Democrats hired their own. He concluded the district needed a 60% Latino voting population to comply with the VRA.\nMost Latino voters lean Democratic, so drawing such a map could diminish Republican political power.\nConcerned, Graves and another Republican member convinced Republicans in the state Senate to pay for an opinion from a Seattle law firm it used for legal work. It concluded that drawing lines to comply with Section 2 racial mandates could give grounds for a 14th Amendment lawsuit.\n\u201cI don\u2019t read Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act to say one party gets to win over another,\u201d Graves later testified.\nPartisan arguments dragged on during an all-night meeting the commission held on Nov. 15. Graves at one point asked Democrats what would be a \u201cfair trade\u201d if they got a majority Hispanic district in the Yakima Valley. If Republicans gave up voting strength there, he argued, the GOP should get an adjustment elsewhere.\nWith all of the haggling, the commission blew its midnight deadline but continued working through the night to reach an agreement that it could forward to the state Supreme Court. Worn down, Democrats finally agreed to the Republican proposals for the new 15th Legislative District.\nGraves was in charge of plugging final numbers into computer mapping software. Democrats later complained that his final map put the Latino voter percentage a tad lower than they had expected, at just over 50%. Graves said Democrats were consulted on every mapping adjustment.\nThe Washington Supreme Court allowed the commission\u2019s work to stand despite its tardiness, and the maps were used in the 2022 elections.\nLatino plaintiffs filed the Section 2 lawsuit in January 2022. The commission was not a named defendant, but the panel\u2019s work was at the heart of the case. All the commissioners were expected to be state witnesses.\nGraves and some other commissioners were upset when the office of the Democratic attorney general declined to defend the map and told the commission to hire its own attorney. Commission Chair Sarah Augustine resigned in March 2022, criticizing the state\u2019s lack of legal support.\nGraves believed that the state\u2019s refusal to defend the map could lead the judge to render a judgment that would invalidate the map, which would have been \u201ca disaster,\u201d he testified.\n\u201cI was faced with the prospect of having to raise private funds to defend a public map,\u201d he testified. Graves, a former lawmaker who ran the legal department of a trucking firm, urgently worked the phone. He got in touch with his state and national Republican contacts, including Kincaid, the director of the NRRT and its foundation, whom Graves had reached out to soon after his appointment. Graves said he wasn\u2019t sure at first what the appropriate legal strategy should be, but he knew he had to move expeditiously.\nThrough a GOP contact, Graves connected with Garcia, an Iraq combat veteran and prominent Latino Republican who wanted to run for Congress. Garcia testified that they talked by phone about the map and whether it could be a \u201cracial gerrymander\u201d drawn to favor Latino Democrats. They discussed whether Garcia would quickly file a lawsuit challenging the map, and Graves connected him with two Seattle lawyers and Kincaid. Graves also urged him to bring on a national Latino GOP group as a co-plaintiff. (The group never signed on.)\nGraves emailed Garcia that Kincaid\u2019s foundation \u201ccan serve as a funding vehicle for this work.\u201d Kincaid declined to comment on foundation spending.\nAs a commissioner, state ethics rules restricted what Graves could share with outside parties about private commission deliberations. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers introduced texts and emails that showed Graves guiding Garcia and questioned how Graves \u201cfound it appropriate \u2014 as a lawyer \u2014 to coordinate the filing of a lawsuit he believed to be meritless in order to interfere with a separate ongoing federal proceeding.\u201d\nGraves called the accusations made by plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers false and \u201cscurrilous.\u201d\nIn a statement, he told ProPublica his \u201csingular goal, once a lawsuit was filed, was to defend the maps.\u201d\nFor his part, Graves said he never believed his map was an illegal racial gerrymander, as Garcia\u2019s lawsuit asserts. But Graves testified that he thought a 14th Amendment challenge \u201cwould at least meet the immediate goal\u201d of delaying a default judgment.\nGarcia\u2019s testimony was also damaging. He said in his deposition that he knew little about the case brought by Latino voters until he talked with Graves and that he rarely spoke with his own lawyers. Asked who was paying his legal fees, he could only say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d The legal team Graves helped arrange included state Rep. Andrew Stokesbary, the new House minority leader and a friend of Graves, and the national law firm of Jason Torchinsky, the NRRT\u2019s chief counsel and a leading GOP redistricting litigator.\nGarcia\u2019s deposition harmed the suit so much that his lawyers later tried to have much of it corrected to reverse many of his assertions, including his testimony that his lawyers rarely talked with him. The judge would not allow the corrections.\nStokesbary, Torchinsky and Garcia did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\nWhile the Garcia case was in motion, Stokesbary and Torchinsky agreed to represent three GOP intervenors in a parallel effort to derail the plaintiffs in the original case. This new effort sought to preserve the commission\u2019s map. The intervenors, including a GOP lawmaker and the brother of an aide to a GOP redistricting commissioner, argued that Graves\u2019 map did not violate Section 2 and no remedial map was needed.\nThe attorney general\u2019s office asked the judge to investigate possible conflicts by Stokesbary and Torchinsky, who were representing clients arguing two opposite legal positions. As a leading Republican in the House, Stokesbary had voted to approve the plan Garcia was challenging. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers argued that the conflicts traced back to Graves and his effort to \u201cconjure up nonmeritorious and competing legal claims.\u201d The judge allowed the attorneys to continue after their clients signed waivers.\nAfter a four-day trial, the judge ruled in August 2023 that the Yakima Valley map must be redrawn before the 2024 election. Then a three-judge panel said the decision in the case brought by Latino voters rendered the Garcia case moot.\nGraves took the stand during the trial and offered a convoluted defense. He described his fear that the commission\u2019s map would be thrown out and his frantic effort to stop that. \u201cI was trying to make sure the maps have a full-throated legal defense,\u201d he testified.\nHe argued that the commission did not intentionally violate Section 2. The federal law, he said in a deposition, is \u201cnot crystal clear.\u201d\nAs the battle against Section 2 has continued, Torchinsky has emerged as one of the most significant GOP lawyers in fights over election mapmaking.\nA fierce litigator, Torchinsky and his firm, Holtzman Vogel, have represented Republican congressional and Senate fundraising committees, the Republican National Committee and a long list of leading GOP candidates and PACs. In Texas, his efforts to shield Kincaid from demands that he give a deposition and produce documents in a Section 2 lawsuit brought by Latino plaintiffs dragged on for more than a year. An appeals court is still weighing GOP claims of legislative privilege in the case.\nIn Florida, Torchinsky worked for more than 100 hours with the staff of Gov. Ron DeSantis in 2022 to create an alternate congressional redistricting map that would be more favorable to Republicans. A circuit court judge ordered the map redrawn, saying it diminished Black voting strength, but an appeals court overturned the decision. The Florida Supreme Court has said it will hear the case.\nThat same year, Torchinsky weighed in on a Section 2 case before the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that many legal experts expect to become the next Supreme Court showdown. The case involves a challenge from the Arkansas NAACP to the state\u2019s 2021 redistricting plan. In a major ruling questioning decades of precedent, a three-judge panel said private parties lack standing to bring Section 2 lawsuits because the law gives enforcement power only to the U.S. attorney general.\nTorchinsky had filed a brief on behalf of GOP Sen. Tom Cotton arguing that the courts should not allow private parties to bring lawsuits. The law is specific, he said, and to \u201cinfer otherwise would be an act of judicial lawmaking incompatible with the power of the federal judiciary.\u201d\nThe appeals court recently declined to rehear the case, and the Arkansas NAACP and other plaintiffs are weighing an appeal to the Supreme Court.\nTorchinsky\u2019s clients had a setback in June 2023 when the Supreme Court issued an unexpected 5-4 decision upholding Section 2. The case involved a challenge to congressional maps brought by Black voters in Alabama. Representing the GOP congressional delegation in a solidly Republican state, Torchinsky urged justices to reverse the lower court\u2019s order that the map be redrawn. \u201cThe Voting Rights Act was never intended to guarantee the success of one political party given the coincidence that the minority group prefers that political party,\u201d he wrote.\nTorchinsky explained his reasoning a few weeks later in a podcast interview. He reflected a view shared by the NRRT\u2019s Kincaid, who told ProPublica in a statement that lawyers for the left, funded by vast sums of \u201cdark money,\u201d are turning the VRA \u201cinto a vehicle to elect more Democrats rather than to elect minority candidates.\u201d\nTorchinsky described the difficulties in many states of separating race and politics. As he put it, \u201cWhen an African American can\u2019t win a statewide election in Alabama, is it because they are Black? Or because they are running as a Democrat? And I think that is some of what the courts should be trying to untangle in these cases.\u201d\nTorchinsky predicted \u201csubstantially more litigation\u201d as state legislatures wrestle with tensions between Section 2 and the 14th Amendment.\nLevitt, the former Justice Department official, said several justices have clearly expressed opposition to Section 2, so Republican lawyers in recent years have been appealing any case that might raise a new issue and have a chance to win over the Court\u2019s conservative supermajority.\n\u201cYou put enough bait in the ocean, and sometimes you catch a fish,\u201d he said.\nThe remedial map-drawing process is close to completion in Washington, with a judge\u2019s decision expected this month. A court-appointed special master is considering five possible fixes. Republican leaders have condemned all the plans as Democratic gerrymanders that could disrupt four to eight GOP districts and change the election districts of hundreds of thousands of residents.\nIn recent months, GOP state Sen. Nikki Torres has joined the lawsuit brought by Latino voters as a third party with a personal stake in the outcome, arguing that the maps do not need to be redrawn to give Latinos a greater voice. She won election as the first Latina senator from Central Washington in 2022 with about 68% of the vote under the 15th District map drawn by the commission.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 lawyers consider her entry into the case just another delaying tactic that, if successful, will leave challenged maps in place for the 2024 election cycle.\nErnest Herrera, of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said: Lawyers for the intervenors are \u201ctrying every way they can to delay the Latino plaintiffs from having a map in which they can elect or have the opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.\u201d\nThis story was originally published on Feb. 28, 2024, by ProPublica.", "length": 17568, "publishedTime": null, "rating": [5, 6, 7, 6, 6, 5, 4], "reason": "The article provides a detailed account of the complex dynamics surrounding the Washington redistricting process, detailing the involvement of various political actors and the legal battles that ensued.

And do they fit in the culture of the organization? If they fail on either one, you're going to be in trouble.\"Culture is more important than raw talent, Cuban said. Most of the workforce agrees: 56% of workers rank a strong workplace culture as more important than salary, with more than 75% of employees saying they'd consider a company's culture before applying for a job there, according to a 2019 Glassdoor survey of more than 5,000 adults in the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany.Young millennials and Gen Zers consider company culture a particular priority, the Glassdoor report noted \u2014 meaning Cuban's observation many prove more true over time, as those workers increasingly rise through the ranks.Cuban does value employees who complete tasks correctly and efficiently \u2014 that's the competency part. But searching for the perfect worker to fix your company's problems, a \"home run hire,\" without properly vetting their cultural fit is \"probably the biggest mistake I've seen my portfolio companies [make],\" he said.To find employees who check both boxes, Cuban said he asks specific job interview questions like:What's one thing you've failed at and one thing you've succeeded at?Tell me about a time you took a chance at work.Why did you leave your last job?What's the best culture of a company that you've ever worked in?Who's the best manager you've ever worked for?\"I want to get them talking about their positive or negative experiences, so I can understand whether or not they're going to be a fit,\" he said.For Cuban, the right fit doesn't mean a carbon copy of himself: He looks for employees and partners who \"complement\" his skill set, but are unafraid to speak up when they disagree with him, he noted.\"I think one of the biggest problems an entrepreneur [or] CEO can make is they hire people who are like them,\" Cuban said. \"You don't need to hire people like you. You've got you.\"\"I don't need people to tell me yes,\" he added. \"I can tell myself yes ...

While the developers claim this is just the beginning, it\u2019s not looking promising considering how much money is involved. Who Is The Best Hang In Unicorn Overlord? A Scientific RankingOffEnglishOn February 29, the third major playtest for the upcoming NFT-powered metaverse project\u2014Otherside\u2014happened. The event was called \u201cApes Come Home,\u201d and the big news was that folks who owned a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT could arrive, see their NFT realized in full 3D, and gain access to an exclusive digital clubhouse. Here players could walk around, take selfies, twerk, walk some more, and do all of this in silence as the test didn\u2019t support text or voice chat. All the more time to contemplate whether spending $70,000 on a digital monkey to gain \u201cexclusive benefits\u201d in a Second Life knock-off was actually worth it.Otherside is a still-in-development browser-based NFT metaverse MMO that is being developed by Yuga Labs, the company responsible for Bored Apes and Mutant Apes. In May 2022, Yuga was able to sell $300 million worth of digital land in the upcoming game. So there\u2019s a lot of money involved. Yuga claims that Otherside will support multiple NFT types and eventually contain user-created games, like Roblox. To help build this large metaverse, Yuga has held a series of \u201ctrips\u201d or tests in the past. The first was held in 2022. The second in 2023. These, however, were barebones affairs using default avatars and temporary assets. February 29\u2019s event was different, as it was meant to showcase one of the 200,000 land plots that will make up Otherside, as well as show Bored and Mutant Ape owners what all their money is going to get them.Looking at videos and pictures of the event, Otherside doesn\u2019t look great. The graphics aren\u2019t ugly, but extremely bland. The performance is choppy. And animations are limited. It looks more like a browser-based 3D chat room from 2013 than a big, expensive 2024 metaverse project. But it falls short in that comparison, too, because at least in even the cheapest, crappiest of those virtual chat rooms, you could talk to people. You can\u2019t actually chat in Otherside.The moment players arrive in the NFT metaverse, they are attacked by a goat. This is the \u201clore\u201d behind why nobody can talk. They are then given a camera by a little digital creature called a \u201cKoda\u201d and set free to run around aimlessly and look at this first part of Otherside. If you owned an ape NFT, you\u2019d be able to play as your NFT re-recreated as a 3D avatar. If not, you run around as some weird techno-voyager-robot thing, though only ape holders could access the clubhouse in the swamp.\u201cThis is the thing that spending $75,000 on this NFT got me, access to this place here,\u201d said Orangie, an NFT content creator, when they entered the clubhouse for the first time. They sounded excited\u2014or at least like they were pretending to be\u2014but as they walked around this exclusive bar/clubhouse, I wasn\u2019t sure the privilege was worth even $75. The place looked about as fun as a random building in World of Warcraft.In an official video from Otherside, an ape is seen taking a selfie in a bathroom as another ape twerks in a stall. If this clubhouse action sounds like a good time to you, well, you\u2019ll need to buy an ape. The cheapest one as of this writing is around $72,000. But, actually, you can\u2019t play Otherside anymore. Sorry?During the \u201cApes Come Home\u201d event, Yuga only let players run around this area of Otherside for 60 minutes. They held three separate hour-long sessions. They said this was to give everyone a chance to enter and to limit strain on the servers. I think the time limit was because they know there\u2019s not much to see or do in this first world and the devs didn\u2019t want anyone sticking around for a few hours and figuring that out. Though even Orangie, a person who has spent at least $70,000 on NFTs and is a true believer in this metaverse/clubhouse concept, admitted in their video review that they got bored of just flying and walking around mostly empty-looking landscapes with their expensive ape avatar.Perhaps Otherside will expand into more in the future. Yuga Labs has big plans, at least. The studio says it wants to turn Otherside into an experience that can support user-made games and content, similar to Roblox or Fortnite. However, those games are free-to-play and have deals with big brands like Star Wars. Otherside\u2019s pricey entry fee\u2014the cheapest option for entrance appears to be buying an Otherdeed NFT for around $600\u2014and lack of gameplay or big IP will be a hard sell for kids and folks looking for a new online game.

Several resident welfare associations and citizen groups from Mahadevapura highlighted the much-needed drive for the removal of dangling OFC cables in a meeting with the Joint Commissioner of Mahadevapura, Dr Dakshayini K. After that, the officials have been carrying out the removal drives and have covered some of the areas in the constituency.On July 12\u201321, the first drive was carried out, and the dangling cables were removed in places such as Whitefield, Marathahalli, and Hoodi. Many of the cables hanging from the transformers, electric poles, or even trees were removed with the precautions taken by the authorities.The drive was again continued between the first two weeks of August, and areas like Doddanekundi, Bellandur, KR Puram, and Marathahalli flyover were covered.\u201cMany RWA members and citizen groups highlighted the need for the removal of OFC as it was posing safety hazards. To prevent unwanted accidents, we started with the drive, as many people who are walking can come into contact with the wire, which could be extremely dangerous. Even those riding bikes and children playing can come into contact, and there could also be chances of strangulation. We have observed that many areas across the constituency have this issue and are carrying out the drive for the safety of citizens,\u201d said Dr Dakshayini. While she also pointed out that as the constituency is bigger, the process would take time and be completely free of dangling wires, and that the removal had been carried out with the engineers and health inspectors in place.\u201cThe process is ongoing and will take some time. Even after removing it, there are even chances that some of the providers will come and put it up again. This again lengthens the process for the officers. Illegal OFC cables are not allowed, and permission needs to be obtained from the BBMP to install the cables. All the cables should go underground,\u201d added Dr Dakshayini. A few days ago, the Whitefield Rising group filed a complaint with the DCP of Whitefield against an illegally laid OFC. However, so far, no complaint has been registered..A BBMP official from the Mahadevapura zone said, \u201cThe drive was initiated based on the Whitefield Rising complaint. We have removed many dangling cables, and we will shortly carry out another drive as well. There needs to be strict vigilance for the illegal cables not to come back.

We will also start filing complaints about the illegal cables installed at the police station.\u201dA recent incident was reported on Kariyammana Agrahara main road where a 23-year-old was trapped under the electric pole due to the dangling cable from the pole getting stuck in the truck, dragging the pole down, and the pole falling on the 23-year-old boy. It has resulted in many citizens asking the BBMP to remove all the dangling cables and file complaints against those installing the illegal cables.

CLICK HERE NOW TO GET THE ZQUIET DIRECTLY FROM THE OFFICIAL WEBSITE ZQuiet Reviews: FAQs How quickly after using the ZQuiet gadget can I expect results? When the ZQuiet device is correctly positioned in the mouth, it should immediately relieve snoring. Breathing blockages caused by snoring are lessened by the device by maintaining free airways and supporting throat tissues. However, each person's experience may differ. Even while the device provides instant relief, continued use and addressing the underlying causes of snoring may be necessary to maintain results. What makes ZQuiet superior to a specially molded one? Even with custom-molded devices that can run into the hundreds of dollars from a dentist, there are trade-offs. Because the moldable material is held within by a hard exterior shell, they are often heavy, stiff, and cumbersome. This design restricts the natural mobility of your jaw as you sleep. ZQuiet provides the same function as a mouthguard but with a softer, more flexible material that lets you open and reopen your mouth and move your jaw freely. For this reason, the majority of consumers find ZQuiet to be more comfortable than the specialized options. Therefore, it's not only more accessible and less expensive, but it's also the best choice available! What are the ZQuiet Anti-Snoring device's setup requirements? The ZQuiet device is simple to set up and doesn't require any extra knowledge or configurations. It is recommended that you wash your hands with warm water and soap after opening the device to prevent putting anything dangerous in your mouth. To ensure proper use, place the device in your mouth or jaw before going to bed, and wash it with warm water after every usage. The gadget is made to be adjustable and simple to use. What are the advantages of buying ZQuiet products through the official website? Purchasing from the official ZQuiet website ensures that you will have access to genuine products and other mouth-watering discounts. Additionally, there could be advantages like free shipping, rebates, and customer service when buying through the official channel. It contributes to a seamless shopping experience and the availability of authentic goods produced in accordance with quality standards. What is the lifespan of the ZQuiet gadget and when should it be replaced? The ZQuiet device's longevity is contingent upon appropriate handling and upkeep. With the right maintenance, the device can last up to a year, but for best efficacy and hygiene, it should be replaced every four to six months. After every usage, the device can be stored in a sturdy, portable container that reduces environmental contamination. Does every jaw shape fit the ZQuiet device? Although the ZQuiet device can fit a variety of jaw forms, not everyone's jaw structure will be accommodated by it. That being said, the device works with about 90% of jaw forms. Most users should find the device comfortable and simple because of its lightweight design and adjustable features.

In the Sungsoo district, known for its youthful and trendy atmosphere, the renovation of industrial buildings has given rise to a distinct architectural style characterized by rough concrete finishes and the replacement of traditional facades with expansive glass storefronts. While these transformations have invigorated Sungsoo economically and culturally, they mask a fundamental issue concerning old industrial buildings in Seoul: the lack of insulation. In our efforts to revamp an outdated and uninsulated factory for a label fabrication company, insulation took center stage as a critical feature of the transformation.\u00a9 Jang MiPlan - 1st Floor\u00a9 Jang Mi\u00a9 Jang MiMuch like the majority of industrial buildings in Sungsoo, our selected factory featured a two-story, L-shaped concrete structure with brick cladding. The primary factory building served a range of purposes, including label production, storage, and office space, while an annex located at the southern end, constructed with concrete blocks and metal beams, was designated for storage, bathrooms, and dining facilities.ModelPlan - Ground Floor\u00a9 Jang MiTo optimize the factory's logistical flow, we reconfigured the layout by consolidating all production and storage areas on the ground floor, streamlining the process from product arrival and processing to storage and distribution. Meanwhile, the office space, originally spread across two levels of the factory, has now been centralized on the second floor.\u00a9 Jang Mi\u00a9 Jang MiOur approach to insulation was tailored to the specific needs and thermal heat gain of each floor. Minimum insulation was applied on the ground level since the machinery produce enough radiant heat to warm up the space. In contrast, the second floor was equipped with thicker insulation to compensate for the absence of an internal heat source. This strategic design approach resulted in a distinctive vertical crenulation effect, creating a nuanced interplay of varying insulation thicknesses.\u00a9 Jang Mi\u00a9 Jang MiRear ElevationPreservation is often touted as a sustainable practice in architecture. However, as we face the challenge of reducing our carbon footprint, we must reimagine preservation not only as an appreciation of its old age but also as a way to equip old and cold buildings with the tools for their prolonged survival.\u00a9 Jang Mi\nProject locationAddress:Seoul, South KoreaLocation to be used only as a reference.

Apple made last-minute tweaks to the Digital Markets Act (DMA) compliance plan to add flexibility, but they\u2019ve met mixed reactions among developers.Developers considering Apple\u2019s post-DMA fee structure, which comes with a new \u201cCore Technology Fee,\u201d can now try them out and then switch back to the original terms \u2014 instead of, as originally announced, making the change a one-way trip. In an update posted on Tuesday, Apple says it created the \u201cone-time option\u201d to revert to Apple\u2019s standard agreement in case of \u201cunexpected business changes\u201d or if developers just change their minds. But there\u2019s a caveat: developers can only switch back if they didn\u2019t put their apps on an alternative app store or use alternative payment options.Apple\u2019s new rules let developers distribute their apps on third-party marketplaces and use alternative payment options. Even if they don\u2019t distribute outside the App Store, they can opt in to the new structure and benefit from a lower App Store commission rate. But if their app has more than 1 million annual installs a year, they\u2019ll need to pay that 50 euro cent fee for every additional installation and update \u2014 which can add up, especially for popular freemium apps.As described by Apple, here are the updates the company made to its DMA policies on Tuesday:Decisioning by membership:\u00a0To make it easier for more developers to sign up for the new terms, we\u2019ve removed the corporate entity requirement that the Addendum must be signed by each membership that controls, is controlled by, or is under control with another membership. This means an entity can now choose to sign up for the new terms at the developer account level.Switching back:\u00a0To help reduce the risk of unexpected business changes under the new terms, such as reaching massive scale more quickly than anticipated, or if you simply change your mind, we\u2019ve created a one-time option to terminate the Addendum under certain circumstances and switch back to Apple\u2019s standard business terms for your EU apps. For details, view the\u00a0Addendum.Alternative app marketplace requirements:\u00a0To make it easier for developers who want to create alternative app marketplaces, we\u2019ve added a new eligibility criteria that lets developers qualify without a stand-by letter of credit. For details, view the\u00a0marketplace support page.Apple is now giving developers a chance to change back to its standard terms, which means ditching the per-installation fee and returning to the higher commission rate. That offers a way out for app creators who rack up millions of downloads but can\u2019t afford the fee \u2014 but only if they haven\u2019t gone outside the App Store. While this should allow developers to test the waters with Apple\u2019s new terms, it also arguably discourages developers from trying out alternative app stores, which undercuts a major goal of the DMA.\u201cI believe that the concept of these new agreements... bears an uncanny resemblance to a mafia-like ultimatum to developers, essentially conveying, \u2018Remember who\u2019s in charge here, I\u2019m your friend if you remember that; I\u2019m willing to give you one more opportunity to stay with me,\u2019\u201d developer and author Maximiliano Firtman tells The Verge. \u201cThat new rule, along with most of the new regulations for publishing in EU countries, appears overly complex, potentially creating a significant barrier for developers, deterring them from even attempting to navigate these waters.\u201dBut other developers see the update as a welcome change. \u201cI think this will encourage more developers (especially indies) to adopt the terms\u00a0just\u00a0for the reduced App Store commission rate, because now they can \u2018try it out\u2019 and see whether they stay under the CTF [Core Technology fee] threshold,\u201d AltStore developer Riley Testut says in an emailed statement to The Verge. \u201cI\u00a0don\u2019t expect many developers to\u00a0actually\u00a0revert, but just knowing they can will give them the confidence to adopt the terms.\u201dDavid Barnard, the founder of software development company Contrast, similarly writes in a post on X that Apple has \u201celiminated the risk in accepting the new terms.\u201d In addition to allowing developers to switch back to Apple\u2019s standard terms, Apple is also making it easier for some developers to open an alternative app store. As outlined in Apple\u2019s terms, developers can now open a third-party store if they\u2019re a member of good standing in the Apple Developer Program for at least two continuous years and have an app with more than 1 million annual installs in the EU. Apple previously required all developers to present a \u20ac1,000,000 letter of credit\u00a0from an \u201cA-rated\u201d financial institution.The DMA\u2019s rules went into effect for digital gatekeepers like Apple on Wednesday. Although Epic Games previously announced that it was going to bring Fortnite and its game store to the App Store, Apple quickly dashed those plans. Apple revoked the game publisher\u2019s developer license after fielding harsh criticism from Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, saying the company is \u201cverifiably untrustworthy.\u201d There are still other app stores coming to iOS, however.

Dominguez interrupted Ryan Baasch, a Texas assistant attorney general, during his closing arguments to dispute the state\u2019s characterization of its investigation.\n Baasch said the case has unnecessarily escalated and the documents the state has asked for are \u201cinnocuous material.\u201d He said state officials have offered to negotiate with Annunciation House.\n \u201cThis is the part where you\u2019re starting to offend my intelligence. You did not offer to negotiate. You did not offer to act in good faith,\u201d Dominguez interrupted Baasch from the bench.\n Dominguez continued by saying that Paxton\u2019s office was \u201crude and unprofessional\u201d when it made its demands for Annunciation House\u2019s documents. He said that from \u201cday one all I\u2019ve heard is a willingness to comply\u201d from Annuncaition House \u201cso that everyone\u2019s interests are protected.\n \u201cThere was no attempt whatsoever to negotiate by the attorney general, which is what gives the court rise for concern that there are ulterior political motives here taking place that go outside of what the law requires, go outside of what the law demands,\u201d Dominguez added.\n Baasch responded by saying the state\u2019s request for the documents \u201cmay seem to impose a significant burden\u201d on Annunciation House but that state law requires a quick response.\n Dominguez said that he would make a ruling on whether Annunciation House has to release the specific records the state is asking for as soon as possible.\n In early February, Paxton\u2019s office sent three lawyers to Annunciation House, seeking records about the shelter\u2019s clients and gave the shelter director, Ruben Garcia, a day to turn over the documents. When Garcia\u2019s lawyer, Jerome Wesevich, responded that it wasn\u2019t enough time and asked a judge to determine which documents shelter officials are legally allowed to release, the AG\u2019s office interpreted the delay as noncompliance and filed a countersuit to shut down the shelter network.\n In court documents, the attorney general\u2019s office has said Annunciation House appears \u201cto be engaged in the business of human smuggling,\u201d operating an \u201cillegal stash house\u201d and encouraging immigrants to enter the country illegally because it provides education on legal services.\n Wesevich told Dominguez during the hearing that Garcia has already turned over 200 pages of documents but that the state\u2019s request is \u201can abuse of power to try to stop Annunciation House from doing business.\u201d\n Among the documents the state is seeking are logs of the names of people the shelter has provided services to, a grant application the shelter has filed with the federal government, material it has provided to migrants and a list of all the shelters Garcia operates.\n Garcia said during the court hearing that he is willing to comply with the attorney general\u2019s request but wants a judge to decide which documents he is legally obligated to release. He said he is hesitant to release all the documents the state is asking for because it includes sensitive information such as medical records and the identifying information of migrants who have told them are fleeing people trying to harm them.\n During questioning, Baasch asked Garcia if he was aware of the killing of 22-year-old Laken Hope Riley, an Augusta University nursing student in Georgia. Baasch also asked Garcia if he knew that the suspected killer, 26-year-old Jose Antonio Ibarra \u2014 a Venezulan who immigration officials said entered the country near El Paso in September 2022 \u2014 had stayed at an Annunciation House shelter.\n Garcia said he is aware of the case but doesn\u2019t know if Ibarra may have stayed at one of his shelters.\n The Attorney General\u2019s Office didn\u2019t respond to an email from The Texas Tribune seeking additional information about any links between the Georgia murder and Annunciation House.\n After the court hearing, Garcia said he lost a son to cancer and feels heartache for Riley\u2019s family. But he said he finds it sad whenever someone implies that all \u201crefugees are the same.\u201d\n \u201cIf you take one individual from any demographic group and then try to paint the entire group as a result of the behavior of that one individual, [that\u2019s] unconscionable,\u201d Garcia said to reporters after the hearing.\n For the past few years, right-wing advocacy groups and Republican lawmakers have targeted non-governmental organizations that shelter migrants, many of them asylum seekers, blaming them for incentivizing illegal immigration with taxpayer money.\n Those efforts come as religious figures, emboldened by the rise of Christian nationalism, continue to demonize migrants and those who aid them as part of a broader scheme to dilute the American electorate.\n Annunciation House operates several shelters in El Paso, helping immigrants and refugees obtain food and housing, and providing information on how to complete legal documents to claim asylum in the United States.\n The nonprofit, which opened its first shelter at a local Catholic Church nearly 50 years ago and receives support from the church, said it has helped hundreds of thousands of refugees who have come through El Paso by feeding and keeping them off city streets.\n We can\u2019t wait to welcome you to downtown Austin Sept. 5-7 for the 2024 Texas Tribune Festival!

Most vertebrates, like birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish, reproduce by laying eggs filled with nourishing yolk that their offspring use as an initial source of nutrition before hatching. Mammals change the game by giving birth to live young and feeding them fatty, sugary milk as they get on their feet.But nature breaks rules all the time, and the latest animals to confound the yolk vs. milk binary are caecilians, the egg-laying, legless amphibians that look like worms. Research published Thursday in the journal Science suggests they feed their hatchlings a milk-like substance too, but from their behinds. This behavior is unknown in amphibians.It adds to the curiousness of caecilians, who were already known for feeding hatchlings skin ripped off mom\u2019s back as a postnatal nutritious snack.\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re from another planet,\u201d said Carlos Jared, a caecilian researcher at the Butantan Institute in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, and an author of the study. \u201cFor me, they\u2019re like Martians.\u201dCaecilians are \u201cone of the least understood\u201d vertebrates, Dr. Jared said. Because they spend most of their lives underground, they are difficult to find and even harder to study.Since 1987, his team has been musing about caecilians making milk. After several trips to the cacao plantations in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil, his team managed to collect 16 mothers of the Siphonops annulatus species of caecilians, and their numerous hatchlings. Each mother has four to 13 babies. Back in the lab, they filmed each family during the two months from hatching until the wormy amphibians became independent.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

Leaders frequently travel for various reasons and engage with counterparts who align with their strategic priorities and national interests.\u201dThe trip is seen as part of Orb\u00e1n\u2019s long-running effort to become a central figure in an international conservative movement.\u201cFor him, it\u2019s just a big, big moment in his foreign policy importance, and also he could hope that it makes him more serious in the eyes of others,\u201d said P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, the director of the Budapest-based Political Capital research institute, noting that countries of Hungary\u2019s size did not usually get much attention from US leaders.The Hungarian government \u2013 which maintains relationships with Moscow and Beijing, still employs former communist security officials and is known for its tendency to skew business competition at home \u2013 does not fit in well with traditional American conservatives. The late Republican John McCain described Orb\u00e1n in 2014 as \u201ca neo-fascist dictator\u201d.Nevertheless, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s team have spent a significant amount of time and money on cultivating relationships with a different strand of US conservatives.The Hungarian government has in recent years hired US consultancies with conservative links to help improve its image.The Hungarian embassy in Washington has also been directly involved in the outreach: for example, it hosted the former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy twice in the past year.Last year the prime minister himself hosted Americans who travelled for the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) Hungary at a reception in his office.Meanwhile, a network of Hungarian state-funded thinktanks and foundations fund jobs and fellowships for well-connected conservative American pundits and academics.Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n has defended this approach. \u201cIn line with our connectivity strategy, we aim to cultivate relations in all directions and aspire to establish Hungary as an intellectual hub in the heart of Europe,\u201d he said. \u201dThe Hungarian leader\u2019s positioning has not gone unnoticed among US officials. In an interview with the Guardian earlier this year, the US ambassador in Budapest, David Pressman, said the Hungarian government was pursuing a \u201cfantasy\u201d foreign policy.Orb\u00e1n\u2019s American fans have pushed back against the administration\u2019s approach to Hungary and defended his decision to visit Trump. Gladden Pappin, a conservative academic who serves as president of the state-owned Hungarian Institute of International Affairs and is set to join Orb\u00e1n on the trip, said in a phone interview that \u201cin some way, this kind of visit indicates that the relationship has been unnecessarily politicised, particularly by the American side\u201d.A former associate professor at the University of Dallas who moved to Hungary in recent years, Pappin argued that \u201cthere has been this weaponisation of diplomacy against Hungary on account of its conservative nature\u201d.He added: \u201cI think all of us, you know, on the right side of the aisle from an American standpoint, would hope for normalisation of that relationship if Trump is elected.\u201d", "length": 6531, "publishedTime": "2024-03-07T13:00:00.000Z", "rating": [5, 4, 6, 4, 6, 5, 6], "reason": "The article provides a factual account of Viktor Orb\u00e1n's upcoming visit to Donald Trump in Florida and the background leading up to the meeting.

And second, Kyle Harrison was so dominant in those three innings that Chapman hardly even got to break a sweat.Harrison struck out six of the 12 batters he faced before a steady drizzle turned into a downpour that destroyed the mound. The game was canceled in the third with the teams scoreless.\"It was the best I've seen him throw,\" manager Bob Melvin said of Harrison.Harrison actually struck out six of the first 10 before back-to-back walks as he struggled with his footing. He was visibly frustrated during the second one and the grounds crew came out to try and rebuild the mound. After a couple of warmup pitches, the teams were taken off the field and the game was called off a few minutes later.Harrison is lined up as the Giants' No. 2 starter and the short outing didn't do anything to impact his spring plans. Melvin said Harrison was set for about 60 pitches on Thursday and got into the fifties, so he remains on track to take the ball for the second game of the season.The Dodgers didn't bring their All-Stars to Scottsdale, but Harrison made quick work of the lineup that showed up, sitting at 94-95 mph with his fastball and showing a good feel for all four pitches.Through three spring starts, Harrison has 12 strikeouts in seven innings. He allowed two hits on Thursday but only one left the infield. The second one was the only ball to get near Chapman, who laid out for the grounder but couldn't glove it. Nick Ahmed kept it on the infield, saving a run.Chapman got just one at-bat because of the rain, striking out on a 2-2 fastball on the inside corner. He hit fifth, right behind cleanup hitter Jorge Soler in what appeared to be pretty close to the starting lineup against left-handed pitchers.After a day off Wednesday, the Giants had most of their regulars in there against lefty James Paxton.

It\u2019s a love letter to vintage sexploitation films like Russ Meyer\u2019s Motorpsycho and Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!, Doris Wishman\u2019s Bad Girls Go to Hell, and Robert Aldrich\u2019s Kiss Me Deadly, while also inspired by directors John Waters and Pedro Almod\u00f3var.However, underneath it all lies a girls\u2019 road trip movie which is empowering, enlightening, a little dangerous, and of course, a little fun.The Road MapThe girls' road trip movie (GRTM) is about women who just ~need to get away~ from the monotony of their everyday lives. Abandoning their at-home responsibilities for even a weekend, everything is about being present in the moment with each other, the car, and the road. They meet colorful characters within the Americana melting pot and rebel against the patriarchy through their renewed sense of freedom that comes with connecting to the nature of sisterhood. There might even be car singalongs, a get-rich-quick scheme, and a little bit of crime! (Your mileage may vary.)\u00a0Compared to other forms of travel, a girls\u2019 road trip movie is a pressure cooker. The car is an unsung and unofficial character and the almost always present race against some clock is the antagonist. Compared to planes, trains, and charter buses, a car is usually the most accessible and convenient (also the slowest) way to travel, especially if you\u2019re a teenager \u2013 as we see in many modern versions of this genre. If you have a license, a dream, and the will to drive for hours on end in a metal box while at the mercy of the elements, the world is yours! Trapped in a car together, you become the captain and the crewmembers, you spend every moment together, share lodging and secrets, and are essentially each other\u2019s lifelines out in the expanse of lands with spotty Wi-Fi and sketchy characters.Drive-Away Dolls is a lesbian spin on this genre, yet it drives down the same road as many previous girls\u2019 road trip players have \u2013 one that ultimately transforms its travelers. The boisterous Jamie (Qualley) is caught cheating and is kicked out of her shared apartment, so she joins the buttoned-up and touch-starved Marian (Viswanathan) on a trip down to Tallahassee. In the titular drive-away Dodge Aries, they head out with a destination, some unplanned detours, dildos, and multiple dalliances ahead of them.\u00a0There are a few different dynamics that can come into play in girls' road trip movies: adult best friends (Thelma & Louise, The Sweetest Thing, Joy Ride) or former childhood friends (Unpregnant, Crossroads). Sometimes they\u2019re coworkers or acquaintances (Zola, Death Proof). And while the odd-couple pairing is not required, it\u2019s always more entertaining to have opposing personalities. Women are socialized at a young age to present and act in certain ways that serve the patriarchy and fit within a structure that keeps women in restrictive roles but are at odds with the carefree and curious childlike ways we first experience the world and each other. Remove the constraints of society and we revert to our natures to commune with each other. Consider it the inverse of Lord of the Flies. Women thrive outside of the restrictions of a society constructed by and for men. Take men out of the society that was built for them and they devolve into chaos.\u00a0Unpregnant (HBO Max)Not-So-United StatesMost GRTMs, however, tend to exaggerate the \u201cothering\u201d feeling of visiting a new place with fundamentally different perspectives or customs. It\u2019s a shorthand for how far they\u2019ve traveled, and as always, it\u2019s never a road trip movie without meeting some colorful characters! Sexy strangers, pervy truck drivers, unfazed diner waitresses, unaccommodating motel clerks, and wary gas station attendants all tinge our travelers\u2019 journey with some interesting color. Ideologically different humans show how the United States is not so united in some of its views, forcing women to contextualize their existence in different parts of the country. Unpregnant had fundamental Christians trying to sabotage the girls' trip to the abortion appointment, while a libertarian prepper suited up and drove them there! Balance?So yes, solo road trips are a thing, but sociologically it\u2019s always better and safer when girls go at it together, like going to the restroom! Move in packs. I\u2019m very serious in claiming Mad Max: Fury Road as a GRTM for the example of the dangers to women on the road, effectively leaving them exposed to their natural predators \u2013 men.\u00a0What\u2019s a Nice Girl Like You Doing in a Place Like This?Often, our heroines end up running away from society and its constructs, roles, and expectations, whichever form that may take. In Thelma & Louise, Thelma\u2019s first act of rebellion is forsaking her shitty husband and running off to a fun girls\u2019 weekend. And while she has a flirty dance with a bar hound, it\u2019s the pervasive rape culture and the realization that the court of public opinion will never take their side that drives Thelma and Louise off a cliff. In Death Proof, Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell) gets his kicks off stalking women, taunting them, and running them off the road. He insinuates violence unless he gets the lap dance Julia (Sydney Poitier) promised Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito) would do. The women Stuntman Mike runs into a year later happen to also have stunt women who fight back with a muscle car of their own and kick the shit out of him at the end. In Zola, X (Colman Domingo) is a threatening pimp who uses Stefani (Riley Keough) in an attempt to trap Taylour Paige\u2019s title character into prostitution. Still, the two women form a tenuous partnership to make it through the all-night ordeal. The analogy of restricting and oppressive culture patriarchy is taken to its logical conclusion in Mad Max: Fury Road \u2013 women are seen as property and used as breeders and milk harvesters. So for these women, taking to the road is the way to go.Mad Max: Fury Road (Warner Bros. Pictures)The rapidly expanding collection of road trip movies has also lately become a vehicle (pun intended) for stories of strapped young women with unplanned pregnancies (Unpregnant, Never Rarely Sometimes Always, Grandma, Crossroads). Young women on the precipice of adulthood are making a huge personal decision that will change their young lives. In Unpregnant, Veronica (Haley Lu Richardson) is ostensibly trapped by her ignorant, self-serving boyfriend who wants to keep her from going off to college. Taryn Manning\u2019s Mimi in Crossroads is pursuing her pop singer dreams while pregnant and decides that she\u2019s giving her baby conceived from rape up for adoption.\u00a0On the flip side, however, the road trip encourages a type of sexual freedom; bless these horny tumbleweeds blowing through small towns. Thelma is so satisfied by peak Brad Pitt that she doesn\u2019t realize that he\u2019s robbing them. The women in Joy Ride engage in truly raunchy activities with a basketball team that benched a few of them. Back to Drive-Away Dolls, Jamie and Marian join a basement makeout party. Britney Spears\u2019 entire arc of losing her virginity in Crossroads is iconically captured by \u201cI\u2019m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\u201d! On the road, these women belong to no one but themselves and it\u2019s so freeing!Thelma & Louise (MGM)To quote Ralph Waldo Emerson, \u201cIt\u2019s not the destination, it\u2019s the journey.\u201d Sometimes the destination is only the beginning of the real adventure, where hardships can arise and force these women to scramble. In that process, they learn more about themselves and the world around them while also deepening their friendships. Long live the girls\u2019 road trip movie: the great celebration of the resiliency of being a woman breaking free from a patriarchal society\u2026 and a reminder that we can always take a little break now and then to be present with ourselves and our surroundings.

All that's visible of them are their teenage faces, swathed in black hijabs. They were around 15 and 16 years old respectively when the young Tunisian women became involved with the Islamic State group (IS), which is categorised as a terrorist group by the British government (among others). Their fate, the documentary director Kaouther Ben Hania tells the viewer, was \"to be devoured by the wolf\"\u00a0\u2013 a reference to the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood.\nMore like this:-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Oscar nominee wading into the US culture wars-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Ukraine documentary up for an Oscar-\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Why Anatomy of a Fall's argument went viral\nFour Daughters has garnered Tunisian filmmaker Ben Hania her second Oscar nomination, this time in the documentary category (her first was in the international film category in 2021 for the drama The Man Who Sold His Skin, about a Syrian refugee who sells himself for art in return for a Schengen visa). In Four Daughters, the story of Ghofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui, their younger sisters Eya and Tayssir and their mother Olfa, is told through remembering the events that led to the older sisters joining IS. It reveals a fascinating and disturbing history of generational female trauma, intertwined with the history of Tunisia itself.To begin with, Ben Hania says, she was interested by what might motivate a young woman to join group like IS. \"We're used to men doing this and it's quite new that women are also involved with terrorism. I think I wanted to understand why young women are attracted to this,\" she tells BBC Culture. \"One of the ideas that I found very counterintuitive is that Ghofrane and Rahma were looking for freedom. They wanted to break free from the oppression of their mother. They wanted to prove to their mother and to their father that they were worthy. So, it's mind-blowing for me to understand that a desire for freedom and for another horizon can lead you there.\"\nThere are many photos of young women like the Chikhaoui sisters, who ran away to join IS during the height of the group's acts of terror and occupation. A 2018 report from King's College London estimated that 4,761 female foreign citizens were linked to IS activities in Iraq and Syria between 2013 and 2018.You have the headlines, but what's behind the headlines? For this, you need time, and that's why you have cinema \u2013 Kaouther Ben HaniaLike Ben Hania, the media is also interested in the idea of the female terrorist\u00a0\u2013 and those who join such groups can be judged as harshly as their male peers. A London teenager, Shamima Begum, who joined IS as a 15-year-old, was recently stripped of her British citizenship, although her lawyers had appealed on the basis that she had been groomed by IS. \"You have the headlines,\" Ben Hania says. \"But what's behind the headlines? For this, you need time, and that's why you have cinema.\"\nWhat's memorable about Four Daughters is the way Ben Hania gets to the root of why the Chikhaoui sisters made these choices. As well as asking the girls' mother, Olfa Hamrouni, to participate, and the two younger daughters, the director asked two actresses, Ichrak Matar and Nour Karoui, to play the parts of Ghofrane and Rahma, and Tunisian-Egyptian star Hend Sabry to play Olfa when memories might become too distressing for her. One Tunisian actor, Majd Mastoura, plays all the male characters, a dramatic device adopted to let the female characters stand out.\u00a0\nA tragic cycle of abuse Ben Hania stresses the film isn't a docudrama or reminiscent of a documentary such as Joshua Oppenheimer's 2012 Oscar-nominated The Act of Killing, which asked former Indonesian death-squad leaders to re-enact their crimes. \"Despite the fact you have actors, the acting parts are very small in the film and the actors are acting as a person, they're sharing their thoughts and their questions with Olfa and her two daughters. Maybe we can call it a meta documentary because it's a movie about a movie being done about actors and real characters,\" she suggests.\n\"I started by shooting a fly-on-the-wall documentary, but I quickly realised that it wasn't interesting, I need more to dig deep into this story, so I borrowed tools from fiction, from cinema mainly, to go further and to tell this story in a better, deeper way. \"I brought actors to Olfa and to the two youngest daughters, the real characters, so they can direct the actors to remember their memories and what happened. It's a dialogue, you see, between actor and real character. It's the story of transmission, from mother to daughter, transmission of violence, and what the mother calls 'malediction'.\"Ben Hania asked the girls' mother Olfa Hamrouni to participate, with Tunisian-Egyptian star Hend Sabry taking her part at points (Credit: Twenty Twenty Vision)What's apparent from the film is that Olfa Hamrouni suffered abuse as a young woman, recalling that as a teenager she tried to protect her own mother and sisters from sexual violence, hitting out herself. When she married her daughters' father, she recalls her own sister urging the bridegroom to treat Olfa roughly to get the marriage consummation over and done with. But Olfa punched the groom and used that blood to stain the sheets that were supposed to signify that sex had taken place. Later Olfa, now bringing up her daughters alone, would become violent with her girls, out of fear that they would become what's referred to in the film as \"sluts\"; when Ghofrane dyed her hair and shaved her legs, Olfa recalls beating her. By the end of the film, Olfa tells Kaouther Ben Hania that she is like the cat, \"who out of fear for her babies, eats them. I was so afraid for them, I was unable to protect them. I didn't eat them, but I lost them\".\n\"Olfa refers to this generational cycle in the film as 'the curse',\" Ben Hania explains. \"So, what she went through as a child and teenager, she did exactly the same to her daughters. She understood during the movie what was happening with her and how this inheritance of trauma affected her daughters also. But what is great is that at one point the actors also tell her, 'We all do this. We transfer to our daughters what we inherit from our mothers, and then we finally arrive at the generation that says, stop. We don't want this anymore.' The eldest daughters had a very violent reaction and said no to this cycle, and maybe the two youngest will be saved. They're the hope in this film.\"I think what radicalisation at least offered them is they could reverse the power dynamic with their mother \u2013 Ben HaniaPerhaps what partly motivated Ghofrane and Rahma to first wear hijabs and then niqabs (which, according to the film, were rarely used in public before the 2011 Tunisian Revolution) was to seek safety from their mother, but as they became radicalised further, Ben Hania suggests it was a way of them asserting authority over her. \"I think what radicalisation at least offered them is they could reverse the power dynamic with their mother. They can lecture their mother, they can lecture the people lecturing them about their sexuality,\" she points out.\n\"I think that what is paradoxical in this story, is that the patriarchy is not all the men played by Majd Mastoura, but that someone like Olfa was the guardian of the patriarchy. She was the one putting pressure on her daughters. And since they were beautiful girls, they almost had to refute that they'd turn bad or become 'sluts', as it's said in the movie. When you have this perpetual accusation, because you are women, you have to find a way to defend yourself.\"Kaouther Ben Hania's Four Daughters won best documentary at the recent Spirit Awards and is up for an Oscar (Credit: Getty Images)Ben Hania agrees that Ghofrane and Rahma were also teenagers during a period that was ripe for them to be radicalised. After the instability of the Tunisian Revolution in 2011 and the rise of the Islamic State group, many Tunisians became attracted by the idea of joining the group in Libya, Iraq or Syria. Up to 6,000 Tunisians were estimated to have joined IS by 2015. \"I think about that quote from Italian philosopher Antonio Gramsci, that 'the old world is dying, the new world struggles to be born; now is the time of monsters,'\" she says.\n\"He was talking about Europe between two worlds, but it could be said too about the Arab Spring and the rise of Islamic State. In the twilight, you have monsters. The Revolution, the Arab Spring, shook the dictatorships in the region, but also the new world, the fruit of this revolution, freedom and democracy, they weren't there yet. So, you have all these monsters playing while the new world is late to arrive. Olfa's daughters were in this place with monsters.\"\nGhofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui's names made headlines in Tunisia in 2015 when it emerged that they had joined IS; Olfa would also appear on Tunisian television saying that she'd warned the authorities that that her daughters were being radicalised (she had even requested that they'd lock Rahma up, to prevent her from running away.) They would later be captured in Libya, and in 2023 were sentenced to 16 years in prison. Ghofrane's eight-year-old daughter Fatma is growing up in a Libyan prison with her mother.\nBen Hania reports that her film is still playing in cinemas in Tunisia, nearly six months after its release. However, plans to either allow the sisters to come and stand trial in Tunisia, or to allow Fatma to leave prison, have so far not been successful. Perhaps most moving in Four Daughters, which sums up the history of family trauma revealed by the documentary, is when Eya Chikhaoui is asked what she'd say to her sisters if she could see them again.\n\"This family that has destroyed you, I won't let it destroy me,\" she says.\nFour Daughters is on release now; the Academy Awards take place on 10 March 2024.\nIf you liked this story,\u00a0sign up for The Essential List newsletter\u00a0\u2013 a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our\u00a0Facebook\u00a0page or message us on\u00a0Twitter.;", "length": 10453, "publishedTime": "2024-03-04T11:00:00Z", "rating": [8, 9, 8, 7, 8, 8, 7], "reason": "The article provides accurate information about the documentary \"Four Daughters\" and the story of Ghofrane and Rahma Chikhaoui.

One by one, other countries seen as immune to extremism saw far-right parties enter parliament: The Alternative for Germany party won its first parliamentary seats in 2017; two years later, Spain\u2019s Vox party followed suit. Those parties joined well-established ones in Austria, France, the Netherlands, Sweden, and elsewhere, quickly cementing their place in their countries\u2019 political landscapes.\nIn Portugal, however, a smattering of small far-right parties had tried but failed to win serious influence over the five decades since the 1974 revolution that toppled the country\u2019s dictatorship. When Chega, a far-right party led by the charismatic Andr\u00e9 Ventura, came onto the scene in 2019, it looked likely to face the same headwinds as its predecessors.\nBut the campaign dynamics ahead of the March 10 snap legislative election are proof that the political scene is changing in this country of 10 million. According to recent polling, Chega (\u201cEnough\u201d) could take almost 20 percent of the vote. With the center-left Socialists and center-right Social Democrats running neck and neck for first place, Chega may well end up being the kingmaker for the next government if, as expected, neither mainstream party gains enough seats to form a majority. The results will serve as the latest data point in the far right\u2019s ascent across the continent ahead of European Parliament elections in June.\nVentura, a 41-year-old former TV soccer commentator running on the message of \u201cPortugal needs a clean-up,\u201d has been spurred on by a perfect storm of factors, including the corruption-related resignation of Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Costa late last year, rising frustration with the political system, and a rightward shift among young voters. A wide-ranging corruption probe into members of Costa\u2019s Socialist government triggered this month\u2019s vote and propelled newfound support for Chega.\nAs a result, when it comes to the far right, Portugal is no longer the outlier. In fact, it was never really immune to far-right politics, experts say\u2014it just hadn\u2019t had the right moment or the right leader to capitalize on them.\nThat said, since the 1974 revolution, a confluence of historical factors has helped limit the far right\u2019s ability to gain traction in Portugal. One of these was the nature of the revolution itself, which was a reaction to a conservative dictatorship. Led in large part by left-leaning movements, the revolution prevented \u201canything to the right of the mainstream right from emerging for a very long time,\u201d said Luca Manucci, a political science researcher at the University of Lisbon. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that these parties didn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nPortugal\u2019s long history of immigration from its former colonies, such as Brazil, Cape Verde, and Angola, also meant that immigration has been less divisive here than in many other European countries. \u201cImmigration is not politicized in Portugal almost at all,\u201d said Lea Heyne, who researches Portugal\u2019s far right alongside Manucci. \u201cThis has limited Chega to some degree in the way that they can act as other populist radical right parties act in other countries.\u201d\nFive years ago, Chega barely made a dent on the national level. In the 2019 elections, the newly founded party won just 1.3 percent of the vote and a single constituency in parliament: Ventura\u2019s, located just outside Lisbon. It may not have been a strong showing, but it was a historic first and gave Ventura a springboard to get into the political spotlight.\nVentura has all the right characteristics to draw in voters. As Ant\u00f3nio Costa Pinto, a political scientist at the University of Lisbon\u2019s Institute of Social Sciences, put it, \u201cVentura is the party.\u201d\nVentura came from the center-right Social Democratic Party (PSD), which gives him the veneer of respectability needed to win over a broader range of voters. He broke from PSD in 2018 after an unsuccessful 2017 mayoral campaign near Lisbon, during which he espoused harshly anti-Roma rhetoric, a message he has built on as a member of parliament. Ventura refers to Portugal\u2019s Roma population, which has been in the country for centuries, as \u201ccriminal,\u201d arguing they disproportionately rely on government benefits.\nVentura has also built up a persona based on his willingness to say things other politicians won\u2019t. \u201cHe introduced a new type of political speech, an anti-elitist political speech\u2014the typical populist radical right recipe,\u201d Pinto said. On top of that, Ventura\u2019s role as a professional soccer commentator made him well known across the country. \u201cThe moment he created Chega, all the cameras were pointed at him,\u201d Manucci said.\nIn the 2022 election, Chega drew increased attention on the national stage as it won 12 seats and 7.2 percent of the vote. Since then, Ventura has been able to tap into a swath of voters dissatisfied with the Portuguese political system, including young people and many who had previously not voted.\nA more recent wave of migration\u2014the number of people of foreign origin living in Portugal rose for the seventh consecutive year in 2022\u2014has also allowed Ventura and Chega to begin instrumentalizing an issue that long played a minor role in Portuguese politics. Ventura has advocated harsher penalties for illegal immigration, saying it \u201cdestroys Europe,\u201d and called for \u201cthe drastic reduction of the Islamic presence in the European Union.\u201d\nChega has also pledged to \u201cput an end to corruption\u201d among Portugal\u2019s political elite\u2014a slogan found on its campaign posters plastered around Lisbon. This message resonates with voters in an election where corruption plays a central role. Costa, the prime minister, resigned last November after police arrested his chief of staff and raided his residence and government buildings in relation to alleged influence-peddling surrounding Portugal\u2019s lithium mining industry. (Costa himself has not been accused of wrongdoing.) Another former Socialist prime minister, Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates, will stand trial for a separate corruption scandal.\n\u201cWhen a party tells everybody that the elites are corrupt, and then the elites are corrupt, this can only play into the hands of the far right,\u201d Manucci said.\nVentura clearly sees himself as part of an international far-right movement. After Javier Milei won Argentina\u2019s presidential election in November 2023, Ventura posted on X, formerly Twitter: \u201cThe fight to defend society is taking place in several territories and in Argentina the first battle has been won!\u201d Recently, he told the Financial Times that he considers Italian far-right leader Matteo Salvini \u201ca very good friend\u201d and that he has \u201ca great relation\u201d with Dutch politician Geert Wilders, whose far-right Party for Freedom came in first in the Netherlands\u2019 November parliamentary elections. \u201cI believe we are united,\u201d Ventura said. \u201cWe are strong.\u201d\nPortugal is part of \u201cthe unfortunate pattern of the far right growing everywhere,\u201d said Daphne Halikiopoulou, a comparative politics professor at the University of York who focuses on far-right parties. With European Parliament elections on the horizon, major gains for the country\u2019s far right\u2014combined with growing momentum for similar parties across the continent\u2014will be seen as a bellwether for political trends across the continent, spurred on by anti-immigrant sentiment, anti-establishment populism, and cost of living crises.\nNot only are these parties growing in many countries, Halikiopoulou said, but they are also becoming increasingly normalized. In Europe, the far right is in power in Hungary and Italy; it has joined governing coalitions in Finland and previously in Austria; and it has informally supported governments across the continent, such as in Sweden, where the far-right Sweden Democrats are not officially part of the governing coalition with the center-right Moderate Party but support its legislation.\nThat normalization gives people who are sympathetic to far-right policies moral and political cover to vote for them. \u201cA lot of people who had certain attitudes and didn\u2019t want to be stigmatized\u2014now they\u2019re free,\u201d Halikiopoulou said.", "length": 8656, "publishedTime": "2024-03-07T13:54:48-05:00", "rating": [6, 7, 8, 7, 8, 7, 7], "reason": [{"Accuracy": "The article provides a detailed and accurate account of the rise of far-right politics in Portugal, citing specific examples and historical context to support its claims."}, {"Objectivity": "The article presents a balanced perspective, discussing both the factors contributing to the rise of the far right and the historical limitations that have influenced Portuguese politics.

Pittsburgh", "excerpt": "A new cellphone app that uses AI to accurately diagnose ear infections could be more accurate that trained clinicians.", "textContent": "A new smartphone app that uses artificial intelligence to accurately diagnose ear infections, or acute otitis media, could help decrease unnecessary antibiotic use in young children, according to new research.\nAcute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most common childhood infections for which antibiotics are prescribed but can be difficult to discern from other ear conditions without intensive training.\nThe new AI tool, which makes a diagnosis by assessing a short video of the ear drum captured by an otoscope connected to a cellphone camera, offers a simple and effective solution that could be more accurate than trained clinicians.\n\u201cAcute otitis media is often incorrectly diagnosed,\u201d says senior author Alejandro Hoberman, professor of pediatrics and director of the division of general academic pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and senior author of the study in JAMA Pediatrics.\n\u201cUnderdiagnosis results in inadequate care and overdiagnosis results in unnecessary antibiotic treatment, which can compromise the effectiveness of currently available antibiotics. Our tool helps get the correct diagnosis and guide the right treatment.\u201d\nAbout 70% of children have an ear infection before their first birthday, Hoberman says. Although this condition is common, accurate diagnosis of AOM requires a trained eye to detect subtle visual findings gained from a brief view of the ear drum on a wriggly baby.\nAOM is often confused with otitis media with effusion, or fluid behind the ear, a condition that generally does not involve bacteria and does not benefit from antimicrobial treatment.\nTo develop a practical tool to improve accuracy in the diagnosis of AOM, Hoberman and his team started by building and annotating a training library of 1,151 videos of the tympanic membrane from 635 children who visited outpatient UPMC pediatric offices between 2018 and 2023. Two trained experts with extensive experience in AOM research reviewed the videos and made a diagnosis of AOM or not AOM.\n\u201cThe ear drum, or tympanic membrane, is a thin, flat piece of tissue that stretches across the ear canal,\u201d says Hoberman. \u201cIn AOM, the ear drum bulges like a bagel, leaving a central area of depression that resembles a bagel hole. In contrast, in children with otitis media with effusion, no bulging of the tympanic membrane is present.\u201d\nThe researchers used 921 videos from the training library to teach two different AI models to detect AOM by looking at features of the tympanic membrane, including shape, position, color, and translucency. Then they used the remaining 230 videos to test how the models performed.\nBoth models were highly accurate, producing sensitivity and specificity values of greater than 93%, meaning that they had low rates of false negatives and false positives.\nAccording to Hoberman, previous studies of clinicians have reported diagnostic accuracy of AOM ranging from 30% to 84%, depending on type of health care provider, level of training, and age of the children being examined.\n\u201cThese findings suggest that our tool is more accurate than many clinicians,\u201d says Hoberman. \u201cIt could be a gamechanger in primary health care settings to support clinicians in stringently diagnosing AOM and guiding treatment decisions.\u201d\n\u201cAnother benefit of our tool is that the videos we capture can be stored in a patient\u2019s medical record and shared with other providers,\u201d says Hoberman. \u201cWe can also show parents and trainees\u2014medical students and residents\u2014what we see and explain why we are or are not making a diagnosis of ear infection. It is important as a teaching tool and for reassuring parents that their child is receiving appropriate treatment.\u201d\nHoberman hopes that the technology could soon be implemented widely across health care provider offices to enhance accurate diagnosis of AOM and support treatment decisions.\nAdditional coauthors are from the University of Pittsburgh, New York University, Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence, and Dcipher Analytics.\nThe pediatrics department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine supported the work.", "length": 4212, "publishedTime": "2024-03-05T14:37:19+00:00", "rating": [8, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 7], "reason": "The article provides a detailed explanation of a new smartphone app that is claimed to accurately diagnose ear infections in children better than trained clinicians.

If you\u2019re looking for the best whitening or kids toothpaste, we rounded up ADA-accepted options separately.

Additionally, toothpastes with the ADA Seal of Acceptance do not contain flavoring agents like sugar that cause or contribute to tooth decay.Aside from picking a toothpaste with the ADA Seal of Acceptance, choosing one is mostly a matter of personal preference, said Reboucas. As long as you do not select a fluoride-free option, anything you enjoy using is the right choice for you.Brushing your teeth with toothpaste is only one element of an oral care routine, according to Hewlett. In order to effectively remove plaque and prevent tooth decay, gingivitis, gum disease and bad breath, you should also visit your dentist regularly, as well as use mouthwash and floss daily (or use a water flosser).Toothpaste for specialized needsSome adults\u2019 teeth have additional needs that specialized toothpaste options can address. Reboucas said specialized toothpastes contain specific active ingredients to help with issues like sensitivity and tartar build-up. Some whitening options are made with hydrogen peroxide, the same ingredient that is often found in other teeth whitening products, in order to remove surface stains from teeth. Anti-erosion toothpastes usually contain ingredients to restore the minerals in tooth enamel \u2014 like sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride \u2014 and harden them over time.Experts told us it\u2019s important to speak with your dentist about your unique oral hygiene needs to decide if you should purchase specialized toothpaste. \u201cYour dentist knows your oral health status better than anybody and is an advocate for your oral health, so consult with them and see what toothpaste they recommend for you,\u201d Hewlett said.What about charcoal toothpaste, \u201cnatural\u201d toothpaste and solid toothpaste?Dentists often field questions from patients about \u201ctrends\u201d in the toothpaste space and whether these products are effective. We asked experts to share a few of the most common toothpaste trends they\u2019re asked about and what we should know about them.Charcoal toothpasteCharcoal is often thought of as an ingredient that can absorb toxins and bacteria on your teeth or in your mouth \u2014 similar to how it purifies water. However, experts agree that you should not use it. There are no charcoal toothpastes with the ADA Seal of Acceptance, and a study published in The Journal of The American Dental Association found that there wasn\u2019t enough evidence to support efficacy claims. Experts also said that using charcoal toothpaste may damage the outer layer of enamel since charcoal is abrasive.\"Natural\" toothpaste\u201cCurrently, the FDA does not define the term \u2018natural toothpaste,\u2019 which leaves consumers to define what natural means to them,\" said Dr. Kate Zoumboukos of SW Austin Dental. She said it\u2019s common for the term \u201cnatural toothpaste\u201d to describe options that are free of artificial flavors and ingredients, preservatives, sweeteners and dyes. Experts agree that any toothpaste marketed as \"natural\" is effective so long as it has the ADA Seal of Acceptance.Solid toothpasteToothpaste most often comes in a gel or paste form, but some brands sell solid toothpaste, usually in the form of a tablet you chew into a gum-like substance before brushing your teeth with it. There are no solid toothpaste options that have the ADA Seal of Acceptance, and thus they do not meet our experts\u2019 guidance.Meet our expertsAt Select, we work with experts who have specialized knowledge and authority based on relevant training and/or experience.

New research suggests that at least one species of caecilian also produces \"milk\" for its hatchlings.\n Caecilians are amphibians that look superficially like very large earthworms. New research suggests that at least one species of caecilian also produces \"milk\" for its hatchlings.\n A species of worm-like amphibian has been caught on camera feeding milk to its young. The creature, known as a caecilian, lives underground. Researchers believe that the animal developed the ability to produce a milk-like substance independently of mammals, who are universally known for feeding milk to their young. Caecilians are descended from the same lineage as frogs and salamanders. Hundreds of millions of years ago, their ancestors burrowed deep into the ground. They lost their legs, their eyes mostly stopped working, and their bodies became long and segmented. A modern caecilian looks a little like a long shimmering earthworm with a head, which has led some to call them icky. \n That's a characterization Marta Antoniazzi totally rejects. \"I really don't agree that they are disgusting,\" says Marta Antoniazzi, a biologist at the Instituto Butantan, in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Brazil is home to lots of caecilians and Antoniazzi is a fan. \n \"They are kind of elegant, and they have a shiny body and a very nice face,\" she says. But wait, there's more. The particular caecilian species that Antoniazzi and her colleagues study is called Siphonops annulatus. Mothers of this species give birth to broods of wriggly babies who then proceed to eat their own mother's skin off. \"Once a week, they can eat her skin,\" says Pedro Luiz Mailho-Fontana, a researcher at the Insituto Butantan who was involved in the study. This doesn't seem to bother mama, and the babies get lots of nutrition from the skin. Carlos Jared directs the institute's department of structural biology and leads the team that was studying the caecilians. As he was watching this fascinating process, he couldn't help but notice the wriggly little babies had a ton of energy. \"They are so, so active, it's impossible to eat only once or twice per week,\" he says. So the team stuck a camera in the nest and started watching. And pretty soon, they noticed the babies were gathering around one particular spot. \n \"The babies prefer to go to the tail of the mother,\" he says. And that's when they saw it. A secretion coming from the tail: \"A kind of substance, like milk.\" Upon further study, the team found that the milk contained lipids and sugars similar to mammalian milk. It was essentially providing the same function. \"It's a very unusual form of nutrition\" for an egg-laying animal, says Mailho-Fontana. The team published their results in this week's issue of the Journal Science. \n Marvalee Wake, a professor of integrative biology at the University of California at Berkeley, who was not involved with the study, says that this species of caecilian has evolved to deal with a similar problem faced by human babies. Just like humans, the little ones are born long before they can fend for themselves. They're vulnerable. And in order to help them grow, while keeping them close, their mother has developed a milk-ish fluid. \"This is convergent evolution,\" she says. Convergent evolution is the process by which very different species can evolve similar traits. But is it really milk? The Brazilian team doesn't say whether the milk meets FDA standards, but it does contain lipids and sugars. Wake says she thinks it counts. \"If it has all these basic subunits, it's convergent evolution on a nutritive material, and that's what it's all about,\" she says. For Antoniazzi, caecilians are a wonderful reminder that very different animals, like puppies and underground worm-amphibians, can share a lot in common. \"Nature is very creative,\" she says. \"Sometimes it gives the same solution to different groups of animals.\"", "length": 4567, "publishedTime": "2024-03-07T14:01:11-05:00", "rating": [8, 7, 9, 8, 8, 9, 7], "reason": "The article is highly accurate, presenting scientific findings about a caecilian species producing milk for its young, supported by research published in a reputable journal.
